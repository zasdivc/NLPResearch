0,因为办事处要装修的原因，我住在这旅馆里．这家靠关系得到所谓４星的旅馆，是怎么样的我现在告诉大家一下，在宜宾去那家都比这家好，晚上这里的鸡叫不停．而且不分公母的．会一直叫到２点，我晚上火了，总台会将那个是男的住的房间告诉给鸡婆，晚上你就别想睡的好．投诉了他们说他们没告,"Because of the decoration of the office, I lived in this hotel.What kind of hotels that rely on the relationship to get the so -called 4 -star. I will tell you now that it is better to go to this house in Yibin. The chickens here are constantly.And regardless of father -in -law.It will always be called until 2 o'clock. I was on fire at night. The main station will tell the room where the man's room lives to the chicken, and you don't want to sleep well at night.Complained that they said they did not sue"
0,国展如家酒店是我住过服务和环境最差的酒店！住店当晚身上就起了不明原因的红包，第二天去天津最好的皮肤病医院长征医院一查，医生当即确诊为由于床铺不洁螨虫引起的过敏！更过分的是这家酒店的一位男性服务员，根本就不经客人同意就进入房间，幸亏没有在洗澡！！！还有一些服务不到的地方都没有必要提了，仅上面两条就真心的希望能帮助广大来天津出差旅游的朋友千万不要再住到这家服务素质差，环境差的酒店，受同样的罪！同时做为携程网的白金会员，希望能帮助携程了解到酒店的情况，不要让这样的酒店拖累了携程良好的名声！,"The National Exhibition Hotel is the worst -service and environmental hotel I have lived!On the night of the shop, there was an unknown red envelope. The next day, I went to Tianjin's best dermatology hospital dean to check the hospital. The doctor immediately diagnosed allergies caused by unclean mites!What's more is a male waiter in this hotel, who entered the room without the consent of the guests. Fortunately, he didn't take a bath!IntersectionIntersectionThere are also some places that cannot be mentioned. There is no need to mention it. The above two are sincerely hope to help friends who come to Tianjin to travel to Tianjin. Do not live in this hotel with poor quality and poor environment.Sin!At the same time, as a Platinum member of Ctrip.com, I hope to help Ctrip understand the situation of the hotel. Do not let such a hotel drag down Ctrip's good reputation!"

1,交通倒是方便。价格很成问题，旁边同类型、装修差不多的酒店比这间要便宜（150元），可惜携程没有签约。房间算合格。,"Transportation is convenient.The price is very problematic. Hotels with similar types and decoration are cheaper than this (150 yuan). Unfortunately, Ctrip did not sign a contract.The room is qualified."
1,房间还是一如既往的宽敞明亮，很舒适，在广州市中心能有这样大面积的客房很少，唯一不足是前台CHECKIN慢！,The room is still spacious and bright as ever. It is very comfortable. There are very few rooms with such a large area in the center of Guangzhou. The only disadvantage is that the front desk is slow!
0,第一次用新卡订酒店。简评如下：优点：1.免费升级到套房。2.服务态度好。3.地理位置还好。靠近香港路。窗外望出去就是香格里拉大大的“S”。4.能看见一块像三明治一样大的海。5.两个液晶电视。6.MINIBAR比较便宜。7.里外两套独立的空调系统，出风量大。吹衣服效果不错。缺点：（恐怕比较多）1.房间有新装修的味道。2.房间布局设计问题不小。败笔出处可见。居然还有个隐蔽的衣橱在房间的角落里。3.使用宽带要把书桌拉出来才能看见宽带接口。服务员钻进钻出地帮我找。4.没有睡衣供应。5.装修质量太次了。如果是我的家，我一分钱都不会结给装修队。6.服务有问题。入住的时候，冰箱里什么都没有。MINIBAR什么食品都没有。电话服务台才补上。7.液晶电视是那种小的。大概和我的电脑液晶屏幕差不多大。8.洗漱用品比较次。孤零零地被放在宽大的洗手台上。其它空无一物了。9.保险箱不能用。总之，很多酒店常用设备都缺乏。同样是四星酒店。我还是怀念在栈桥边的泛海名人。房内设施齐全，更加温馨。,"Book the hotel for the first time.The brief comments are as follows: Advantages: 1. Free upgrade to suite.2. Good service attitude.3. Geographical location is fine.Near Hong Kong Road.Looking out the window is the big ""S"" of Shangri -La.4. Can see a sea like sandwiches.5. Two LCD TVs.6.minibar is cheaper.7. Two sets of independent air -conditioning system inside and outside, the air volume is large.The effect of blowing clothes is good.Disadvantages: (I am afraid there are more) 1. The room has a new decoration taste.2. The design of the room layout is not small.The source of the pen is visible.There is actually a hidden wardrobe in the corner of the room.3. Use broadband to pull out the desk to see the broadband interface.The waiter drilled into the ground and helped me find it.4. No pajamas supply.5. The quality of the decoration is too good.If it was my home, I would not get a penny to the decoration team.6. There is a problem with service.In the refrigerator, there was nothing in the refrigerator.There are no foods at minibar.The telephone service desk is only available.7. LCD TV is that kind of small.Probably similar to my computer LCD screen.8. Comparison of washing products.Lonely was placed on a wide washing table.Other empty things.9. The safe cannot be used.In short, many hotels are commonly used.It is also a four -star hotel.I still miss the oven celebrity celebrities by the tower bridge.The facilities in the room are complete and warmer."
1,"酒店挺不错的,接机的车也大,酒店环境也好.离公园大门不远,走走就到,路上还能拍照,很幸运遇上陈大叔给我们做导游.早餐还行.价格略贵些","The hotel is pretty good, the car that picks up the aircraft is also large, the hotel environment is good. Not far from the gate of the park, just walk around, you can still take pictures on the road. Fortunately, Uncle Chen is a tour guide. The breakfast is okay. The price is slightly slightly slightly.More expensive"
1,"酒店的地理位置非常棒,住的高级商务间.感觉房间非常小.门童和服务生都非常热情.还有免费的水果.地毯和装修有些陈旧~","The hotel's geographical location is great, and the high -end business room is living. I feel that the room is very small. The door children and the waiter are very enthusiastic. There are free fruits. The carpet and decoration are old ~"
1,去年出差时就住过中州，当时带客户去的，感觉不错。所以今年出差又选这家了。,I lived in Zhongzhou when I was on a business trip last year. I took customers at the time and felt good.So this year's business trips have been selected again.
1,入住了海悦湾酒店，感觉很不错，我们住的是豪华蜜月房，房间布置的很温馨、浪漫，让我们很是开心和惊喜！房间很新很干净。这里的服务挺好的，有什么问题，服务人员都比较及时的赶来处理。早餐也挺丰富，还有13楼咖啡厅看海非常好！这里的吃住价格我感觉还比较合理，酒店这么贴心的服务让我们感觉到物有所值！,"I stayed at the Haiyue Bay Hotel and felt very good. We lived in a luxurious honeymoon room. The room was very warm and romantic, which made us very happy and surprised!The room is new and clean.The service here is very good. If you have any problems, the service staff comes to deal with it in a timely manner.Breakfast is also very rich, and the cafe on the 13th floor is very good to see the sea!I feel that the price of eating and living here is more reasonable. The intimate service of the hotel makes us feel worthwhile!"
1,每次到杭州都住这家酒店，习惯了。这回房间感觉有点旧，听说酒店正在一部分一部分的装修翻新，希望下回能住到新装修的房间。酒店提供枕头套餐，可以选择不同好几款枕头，这点比较有特色，床很舒服，不是太软也不太硬。宾馆反馈2008年5月20日：感谢您的点评，酒店目前房间装修已经结束，欢迎您下次来体验我们新装修的大床房，期待您的再次光临！,"Every time I go to Hangzhou, I live in this hotel and get used to it.This time the room feels a bit old. I heard that the hotel is renovated in part of the decoration, hoping to live in the newly renovated room next time.The hotel provides pillow packages and can choose different pillows. This is more distinctive. The bed is very comfortable. It is not too soft or hard.Hotel feedback on May 20, 2008: Thank you for your review. The hotel's current room decoration has ended. Welcome to experience our newly renovated large beds next time. Looking forward to your visit again!"
0,"个人认为不符合4星的条件,房间很潮湿,酶味太重,,根本没办法入睡,浴室的条件也不怎么样,总之感觉更像个快捷式酒店","Personally, I think it does not meet the conditions of 4 stars. The room is very humid, the enzyme taste is too heavy, and there is no way to fall asleep. The conditions of the bathroom are not good. In short"
0,这是一个另人难忘的饭店，预定的时候我要三间房，当时告诉我标间、单人间和套间各只有一间了，我想肯定饭店不错，房间才这样紧张的。可事实太不可思议了，本地人告诉我饭店在市郊，很偏的，找了半天才找到，进入的时候里面没有生气，大堂就一位服务员，当时她也没问我预定的事，只是从抽屉取出一大碟卡，原来饭店除了我们仅有一个房间有人住，最可气的是三间房热水器都不好洗澡，换了房也不行。而且开始说烧会就好了，我等到三点也没洗成！被子也感觉不干净！还有结帐时索要发票说要加10%的税，后通过携程协调答应以后寄给我，现在已收到了！整个入住饭店就出现两个人，一个在前台，另一个早上在大厅打扫卫生！这样的饭店还是饭店吗？早饭要到好久的地方才有的。一个人是绝对不敢住的。,"This is an unforgettable restaurant. When I was booked, I had three rooms. At that time, I told me that there was only one room, a single room, and a suite room. I wanted to be sure that the hotel was good, and the room was so nervous.But the fact is incredible. The locals told me that the hotel was on the suburbs. It was very biased. After finding it for a long time, I found it. When I entered, I was not angry.Take out a large plate card. It turned out that except that the restaurant had only one room, there was someone who lived in. The most annoying was that the three room water heaters were not easy to bathe, and it was impossible to change the room.And just start to say that the burning party is fine, I have not been washed until three o'clock!The quilt feels unclean too!There is also an invoice at the checkout to say that the tax will be added, and then I will be sent to me by the coordination of Ctrip. Now I have received it!There are two people appearing in the entire hotel, one in the front desk, and the other in the morning cleaning in the lobby!Is such a restaurant still a restaurant?It will only be available for a long time for breakfast.A person is definitely not dare to live."
1,酒店的外部环境还不错，虽然房间已经有些陈旧，但房间里的设施还算比较齐全，就是去房间要走的楼梯太多；不过以度假村来说，户外的娱乐设施太差，没什么玩的；五一期间入住，950元的礼包有300元的消费券还算实惠，都用来烧烤了，觉得烧烤还是比较有意思的。,"The external environment of the hotel is not bad. Although the room is already old, the facilities in the room are relatively complete, that is, there are too many stairs to go to the room; however, for the resort, outdoor entertainment facilities are too bad to play;During May 1st, the 950 yuan gift package had a consumer voucher of 300 yuan. It was used for barbecue. It was more interesting to grill."
1,经济间是后来装修的，与原来的房间比较小而且只是适合单人，因为洗澡间是磨砂玻璃隔开的，没有浴缸。,"The economy is later decorated, which is relatively small and only suitable for single people, because the bathroom is separated by matte glass and has no bathtub."
1,地理位置还行，就在县城中心，出行比较方便。而且下面临河，风景也还说得过去。但因为是老酒店了，设备当然很一般。而早餐就惨不忍睹了――居然只有8样，一点不像是三星标准提供的早餐！另外，可能会要求你10点前退房，而不是12点！,"The geographical location is okay. It is more convenient to travel in the center of the county seat.And in the face of the river, the scenery is still passing.But because it is an old hotel, the equipment is of course average.The breakfast is terrible -it is only 8, not like the breakfast provided by the Samsung standard!In addition, you may ask you to check out at 10 o'clock instead of 12 o'clock!"
1,每次和王总、Roby出来玩，都喜欢住套房，这次找了个机会入住苏宁环球，Ctrip卡预定网上评论较好的“丽家套房B”，一室一厅一厨87平米，RMB650，22楼，送水果和鲜花，单早，免费游泳池和健身房，送下午茶，免费宽带，免费地下车位，全部落地窗，厨房有冰箱、电磁灶台和洗衣机，适合很多朋友来过周末，不过卫生间里除了龙头是hansgrohe外其他洁具档次略低，客厅的复合地板直接铺水泥地上，脚感太硬，还不如全部用地毯呢，有点遗憾的是给了我们面朝上海路的房间，下次选个礼拜六有球赛面向五台山的房间，还可以免费看球。,"Every time I come out with President Wang and Roby, I like to live in a suite. This time I found a chance to stay in Suning Global.On the 22nd floor, send fruits and flowers, single morning, free swimming pool and gym, send afternoon tea, free broadband, free underground parkIn addition to the faucet is Hansgrohe, other sanitary wares are slightly lower in grade. The composite floor of the living room is directly laid on the cement floor, and the feet feel too hard. It is better to use all the carpets. It is a bit regrettable that we have given us the room facing Shanghai Road.Saturdays have a goal in the room for Wutai Mountain, and you can also watch the ball for free."
0,感觉非常差。地段没有什么娱乐吃饭的地方。房间灰暗。服务态度也是很差。最有趣的是健身房对住客收费。我去查看一下，说了一句“没听说酒店健身房对住客收费的”。结果那个老头说：“没听说现在听说啦！”非常没李矛而且粗鲁。下次绝对不再住。补充点评2008年5月12日：还有，早上下雨，出门才发现酒店不帮人叫的士。只好自己冒雨走到后面的街转角去叫的士。淋了一身雨。四星级？我看根本连招待所都不如。,"It feels very bad.There is no place for entertainment to eat.The room is dark.The service attitude is also poor.The most interesting thing is the gym charged for residents.I went to check it out and said, ""I didn't hear that the hotel gym charged the guests.""As a result, the old man said, ""I haven't heard of it now!"" There was no spear and rude.I will never live next time.Supplementary comment on May 12, 2008: Also, it was raining in the morning, and when I went out, I found that the hotel did not help others.I had to rush to the street to call a taxi.It was raining.four-star?I think even the hospitality is not as good."
1,"福州目前最顶级的酒店.不过豪华阁的服务感觉比两年多前刚开业时退步了.补充点评2007年12月16日：这次进入房间也没看到印有自己姓名的欢迎卡片.上次入住时看到卡片,心里顿升感动.","Fuzhou's currently the top hotel. However, the service of the luxury cabinet feels more than when the business just opened more than two years ago. Supplementary comment on December 16, 2007: I did not see a welcome card printed with my own name this time.When I saw the card when I stayed, my heart was moved."
1,距拱北关口近，标准间太小，豪华大床不错，服务好。,"Near Gongbei Pass, the standard room is too small, the luxury bed is good, and the service is good."
0,虽有一定思想准备，但本以为会比“碧海蓝天”好点呢。去了才发现院内十分荒凉，颇有“年久失修感”。且房间设备简陋，卫生打扫得不好。自来水还带锈味。总之相当一塌糊涂。个人认为还不如一些省市的政府招待所。充其量2星－－算是照顾的。看来这类“产权式酒店”是不能住的，管理很差也很不专业的说。补充点评2008年5月1日：更正：本人给这家酒店的评分偏高实在是由于点错了分数。一不留神把分数都点高了一分。由于网上无法更正，特此在这里更正。,"Although there is a certain preparation, I thought it would be better than the ""blue sea and blue sky"".I went to find that the courtyard was very desolate, and it was quite ""old -fashioned.""And the room equipment is simple, and the hygiene is not well cleaned.The tap water is also rusty.In short, it is quite a mess.Personally, I think it is not as good as governments in some provinces and cities.At best, 2 stars -are considered to be taken care of.It seems that such ""property -type hotels"" are unable to live, and management is very poor and unprofessional.Supplementary comment on May 1, 2008: Correction: I have a high score to this hotel because of the wrong score.I didn't pay attention to the scores higher.Since it is not correct on the Internet, it is here to correct it."
0,我朋友住了2个小时就给我电话让我帮忙退房。她说酒店设备非常陈旧，服务也不好。具体我没有细问。不过可以肯定住了会后悔。,My friend called me for 2 hours and asked me to help me check out.She said that the hotel equipment is very old and the service is not good.I didn't ask for details.But you can regret it if you live.
0,这是个以会议、活动为主的酒店，不适合散客周末闲居。房间较大，但家具粗劣。最糟糕的是卫生间，装修质量很差。预订两夜，因是受不了房间的寒冷而提前退房，那可是初冬啊。建议：带上睡袋，以免感冒。,"This is a hotel, which is mainly based on meetings and activities, which is not suitable for loading customers to live on weekends.The room is large, but the furniture is bad.The worst is the bathroom, and the quality of the decoration is very poor.Booking for two nights, because it can't stand the cold of the room and check out in advance, it is the early winter.Suggestion: Take a sleeping bag to avoid colds."
1,以前住过这家饭店，但那时还是HILTON管理的，现在是NIKKO了，感觉明显不如以前，并且设施也有些陈旧了，但在大连五星级饭店，这家饭店的价位相对来说还比较合理，酒店附近有个新建的时尚生活区，有一些好的餐厅和咖啡店不错，酒店综合服务和管理还需要加强。,"I used to stay in this restaurant before, but at that time I was still managed by Hilton. Now it is Nikko. It feels obviously not as good as before, and the facilities are also old. HoweverReasonable, there is a new fashion area near the hotel. There are some good restaurants and coffee shops. The hotel's comprehensive service and management need to be strengthened."
1,10月2日入住，4日离店。酒店很有特色，房间很干净，被褥都很新，就是床稍有点硬。周围交通很方便，公交线路也很多，步行到秋林公司不到20分钟。从火车站打车就是起车费8元。比起住在东大直街，这里很安静。宾馆楼下是肯德基，周围有酒巴、饭店和超市。推开房间的窗户，就能看到阿列克谢耶夫教堂，步行1分钟就可到教堂。10元的早餐还不错。但是前台服务需要提高，办理入住的时间太长，而且态度也不好。总体来说，还是很满意，下次还会选择再入住这家宾馆。,"Check in on October 2nd and leave the store on the 4th.The hotel is very distinctive, the room is clean, and the bedding is new, that is, the bed is slightly hard.The surrounding traffic is very convenient, and there are many bus lines. It is less than 20 minutes walking to Qiulin.Taking a taxi from the railway station is 8 yuan.Here is quiet than living in Dongda Zhi Street.The hotel is KFC downstairs, surrounded by wines, restaurants and supermarkets.Push the window of the room, you can see the Church of Alexeyev, you can go to the church in 1 minute.The breakfast of 10 yuan is not bad.However, the front desk service needs to be improved, the time to check in is too long, and the attitude is not good.Overall, I am still very satisfied, and I will choose to stay in this hotel next time."
1,我们从北京到呼市，飞机延误一个多小时，到呼和浩特时已经半夜一点多了。酒店为了我们两位普通客人，专程派小车到机场接。上车办理入住手续，到酒店即可直接进房间，不错！房间和干净整洁，设施完善，星级服务。没选择错，下次还住这里。,"From Beijing to Hohhot, the plane was delayed for more than an hour, and it was more than a little in the middle of the night when it was in Hohhot.For our two ordinary guests, the hotel specially sent a car to the airport to pick it up.Go in the car for check -in, and you can go directly to the room when you go to the hotel, not bad!The room is clean and tidy, the facilities are complete, and the star service.I have no choice, I still live here next time."
1,服务很热情，房间温度正好，隔音效果好，地理位置优越，性价比高，下次来还住这里！,"The service is very enthusiastic, the room temperature is just right, the sound insulation effect is good, the geographical location is superior, and the cost -effectiveness is high. I will live here next time!"
1,"总体还可以,就是前台服务员还不够敬业,在登记入住后,看都没看是不是本人,就把我客人的护照给了其它人,幸亏就在旁边,要不然不知后果怎样,之后连说声不好意思,或对不起都没有!!!希望改进!!!","Overall, that is, the front desk waiter is not dedicated enough. After registering and check -in, I did n’t see if I did n’t see it, so I gave my guest ’s passport to other people. Fortunately, it’ s next to it.Sorry, or sorry !!! Hope to improve !!!"
0,１、设备陈旧。墙纸剥落，毛巾破旧，灯泡不亮。２、使用日货。ＴＯＴＯ卫浴，ＳＯＮＹ电视。３、早餐奇差。整个餐厅没有小桌，都是十人的大桌，感觉就象一个大食厅。最可气的是没有水果，难以想象是一个四星级的酒店。４、价格混乱。本人是晚上10:48进酒店的，价格是420元，办完入住手续后发现晚上11:00后入住，价格为180元／晚，住三晚还送一晚，心中大感不平衡；总体感觉就一个字“差”。原本预定了两晚的房间，第二天一早8:30就逃出了酒店，搬到不远的新时空康年酒店。,"1. Old equipment.The wallpaper peels off, the towel is dilapidated, and the bulb is not bright.2. Use Japanese goods.TOTO bathroom, SONY TV.3. Breakfast is poor.There are no small tables in the entire restaurant, and they are all ten people. It feels like a large food hall.The most annoying thing is that there is no fruit, it is difficult to imagine a four -star hotel.4. Chaos in price.I entered the hotel at 10:48 pm. The price was 420 yuan. After checking in the check -in, I found that staying at 11:00 in the evening. The price is 180 yuan / night.It feels like a word ""poor"".The room, which was originally scheduled for two nights, escaped the hotel at 8:30 in the morning the next day and moved to the New Year -time Kangnian Hotel not far away."
0,确实差的无法形容了！我是在华天没房的情况下定了两天房（华天的房间住过感觉也很脏），但康年房是我住过性价比最差的了，其他地方100的房都比他好。而我住的还是238的所谓豪华间了，宽带还要另收费，真没见过！！！结果第二天我就退了，没法再呆下去，转车到桂林过了一晚。,"It is indeed poorly described!I set up a two -day room for two days when Hua Tian had no room (I felt very dirty after living in Huatian's room), but Kang Nianfang was the worst cost -effective, and 100 rooms in other places were better than him.EssenceAnd I still live in the so -called luxury room of 238, and the broadband has to be charged separately. I have never seen it!IntersectionIntersectionAs a result, I retreated the next day, I couldn't stay again, and transferred to Guilin for one night."
1,福州是个很无趣很破旧的地方，还好有这家酒店，才让我能在福州呆了几天。酒店的服务很好，因为订的是豪华阁楼层，所以chickin和chickout就在楼层上办了，方便。早饭也是专门的楼层，就是品种太少。服务员都很热情。房间在五星级里算一般吧，还行。酒店的餐厅价格很适中，味道也还可以，推荐在酒店用餐，比外面的饭店有保障多了。这家酒店最值得推崇的，是他的服务。福州，实在太差，但幸亏有了香格里拉。,"Fuzhou is a very boring place. Fortunately, there is this hotel that allows me to stay in Fuzhou for a few days.The hotel's service is very good, because the luxurious attic floor is ordered, so Chickin and Chickout run on the floor, which is convenient.Breakfast is also a special floor, that is, there are too few varieties.The waiters are very enthusiastic.The room is generally average in five -star, it's okay.The restaurant in the hotel is very moderate and the taste is okay. It is recommended to dine in the hotel, which is much more guaranteed than the outside hotel.The most admired by this hotel is his service.Fuzhou is too bad, but fortunately there is Shangri -La."
0,"当时住的时候火车站还没有搬回来，本来想离火车站近点的,谁想那段时间用的临时火车站,反倒远了。半夜2点入住,前台一个男的,爱搭不理的,后来来了个女的还不错,可能他们也困了吧。前台不大.那个时候在修路.而且从临时火车站到酒店的出租车还绕路，我明知道他绕路,心象就让他绕去吧，知道他什么德行就算了，如果把我扔在半路,2点那真是有钱都没用了。最后多绕了不到5块钱(何苦呢!^%)到了房间，发现可能是火车站不用生意不好，房间没有人用，太多尘土了，到处都是网络还有病毒.最受不了的,是前台的态度.退了房想寄存.说奥运期间不能存,好了，那就接受吧。可是这个时候来了个人，要寄存,他们就给他存了.我就问为什么我就不能存他能存,他们还很横的和我说他没有退房(然后那个男的纠正说他退了房了).我就和她们争,最后她们也给我存了，不知道他们是怎么培训的，还和客人吵架~~~~~~","When I lived at the time, the railway station had not moved back. I wanted to be closer to the train station. Whoever thought of the temporary railway station used during that time was far away.At 2 o'clock in the middle of the night, a man in the front desk was ignored. Later, a woman was not bad. Maybe they were sleepy.The front desk is not big. At that time, the road was renovating. And the taxi from the temporary railway station to the hotel was still detouring. I knew that he was detouring, and let him go around.At halfway, it is useless to have money at 2 o'clock.In the end, it was less than 5 yuan (why bitter!^%) To the room and found that it may be that the train station may not use bad business, there is no one for the room, too much dust, there are viruses everywhere.It is the attitude of the front desk. I want to deposit after retreating. It can not be stored during the Olympic Games. Well, then accept it.But at this time, when the individual came, they would save him. I asked me why I couldn't save him, and they still told me that he had no check -out (then the man's correction said that he retreatedI was in the room). I scrambled them with them, and they finally saved me. I don't know how they trained, and quarreled with guests ~~~~~~"
0,1.服务意识太差，；通过携程订了一间大床房，进房间后，发现房间的地毯脏的实在不行，和值班经理交涉，要求换房。回答居然是：现在没有大床房，要么给你换豪华大床房，但要补差价，要么就是换标房。搞不懂怎么做服务行业的？由于自己的工作失误，给客人带来不便，好象是应该的，还很理直气壮。2.环境太吵3.早餐只能用惨不忍睹来形容，不吃也罢。请大家还是远离的好！！！,"1. The awareness of service is too poor; I booked a large bed room through Ctrip. After entering the room, I found that the carpet in the room was not dirty. I negotiated with the manager on duty and asked to change the house.The answer is actually: there is no big bed room now, either to change the luxury bed room, but to make up the difference, or it is to change the benchmarking room.I don't know how to do the service industry?Due to his own work errors, it seems that it should be inconvenient to guests, it seems that it should be very straightforward.2. The environment is too noisy. 3. Breakfast can only be described as terrible, or not eat it.Please stay away from everyone!IntersectionIntersection"
1,已评定四星酒店，但房间设施仍略显陈旧，细节上还要保持四星级水准，如一次性拖鞋、牙具的质量，水龙头的质量好象也不太好；服务水平上升很快，听出租司机言，评了四星之后，服务生热情不少，但感觉细节上还要再努力一些，不能只体现在表面，如房间卫生打扫，可以将客人用过的水杯清洗干净，放回原位，会让客人觉得很体贴。总体而言还是很好的，房间视野宽阔，服务生笑脸相迎，价位也不是太高，在仪征市区而言，还是一流的酒店，细节上再努力一下会更好了。,"The four -star hotel has been rated, but the room facilities are still slightly old. The details must be maintained in detail, such as the quality of one -time slippers and dental tools. The quality of the faucet does not seem to be very good;After the leased driver said, after the four stars, the waiter has a lot of enthusiasm, but it feels that the details need to be worked more. It cannot be reflected on the surface. If the room is sanitary cleaning, the water cups used by the guests can be cleaned and put it back to the original original.The position will make the guests feel very considerate.Overall, it is still very good. The room has a wide field of vision, the waiter meets the smile, and the price is not too high. As far as Yizheng City is concerned, it is still a first -class hotel. It will be better to work hard in details."
0,整体感觉很不好，尤其前一晚是从迪士尼乐园酒店出来的，==0但是客观而言，这家酒店绝对达不到四星级的标准，以这么高额的房价，我会期待一个比较好的、干净的房间环境，和比较令人满意的服务。也是由于订房仓促，尽管看了很多人的评语，最后还是忐忑不安的订了这间。说是距离地铁很近，但是过程中有看到一家华美粤海，外表看起来更新、更现代，距地铁站也更近。到达酒店后，前台服务人员十分不热情~~~~~连点笑容都没有，我们一行两人在那条莫名其妙的酒吧街上已经饱受惊吓了==0，到了酒店还要看那些前台的臭脸，不爽！房间有股很奇妙的味道，呃，当然是怪味啦！感觉很陈旧，不管什么卫生间也是像各位所说的，水池是坏的，下水速度很慢，花洒也不好用。打电话给前台提出需要修理，结果前台听不懂国语，于是很“自觉”的把电话转到了英文服务。即使这样，最后也没有人来查看。睡觉的时候，又发现被子还是脏的，黑黑的，心头又是一凉。鉴于要在这样的地方住几个晚上，我们也只好睁一只眼闭一只眼，自欺欺人，安分的住了。第二天在床头柜上放了20港币，所以第二天的卫生比第一天还要好，，，==0建议住在这里的朋友晚上回酒店绕道轩尼诗道，从b出口出来往左，这条街正常多了。所花时间好像比从c出口还要少。总而言之，这个价格对于这间酒店而言，太贵了，不合算反正下次再也不会去这间了！！！！！,"The overall feeling is very bad, especially the night before was from the Disneyland Hotel. == 0, but objectively speaking, this hotel will definitely not meet the four -star standard. With such high house prices, I will look forward to a one.A better, clean room environment, and more satisfactory service.It is also because of the rush of reservation. Although I read a lot of people's comments, I finally booked this restlessly.It is very close to the subway, but in the process, I saw a Chinese and American Yuehai. The appearance looks updated, more modern, and closer to the subway station.After arriving at the hotel, the service staff at the front desk is very enthusiastic ~~~~~ There is no smile. The two of us have been frightened on the inexplicable bar street == 0.Stinky face, unhappy!The room has a wonderful taste, uh, of course, it is strange!It feels very old. No matter what the bathroom is said, the pool is bad, the speed of launching is very slow, and the shower is not easy to use.I called the front desk to propose to repair. As a result, the front desk could not understand Mandarin, so I transferred the phone to English service ""consciously"".Even so, no one came to view in the end.When I was sleeping, I found that the quilt was still dirty, dark, and a cold heart.Given that we have to live in such a place for a few nights, we have to open one eye and close one eye, deceive ourselves, and live in peace.The next day I put 20 Hong Kong dollars on the bedside table, so the next day's sanitation is better than the first day .,,, == 0 I suggest friends who live in here to go back to the hotel to bypass Hennessy and exit from B to the left. ThisThe street is much more normal.It seems that there is less time than exit from C.All in all, this price is too expensive for this hotel.

1,"酒店离火车站不远,打的只要8元。就在金山寺边上，人工湖还和风景区相通，可惜没找到入口，否则省了50元门票，岂不快哉！宾馆环境优美，大堂和5星级有得一拼，到那边中午12点就能入住了。248元的房价，房间在5楼，窗外绿树环绕。设施陈旧了点，也还干净。电视机太差，凤凰台看不清。晚饭在餐厅解决的，味道不错，价格公道，服务员态度很好。第二天早上自助餐品种十几样，特色锅盖面（酱油汤面）现场制作。鸡蛋在7:40分就说没有了，但是服务员还从厨房偷偷拿出来自己吃，领班随便在自助区泡豆浆喝。拜托，当客人真空啊。有待完善之处，总体上感觉值得推荐。","The hotel is not far from the railway station, and only 8 yuan is hit.Just beside Jinshan Temple, the artificial lake is also connected with the scenic area. Unfortunately, no entrance is found, otherwise it will save 50 yuan tickets.The hotel's environment is beautiful, and the lobby and 5 -star level have a fight, and you can stay at 12 noon.The house price of 248 yuan, the room is on the 5th floor, and the green trees outside the window are surrounded by the window.The facilities are old and clean.The TV is too bad, and the Phoenix platform can't see clearly.Dinner is solved in the restaurant.

1,这个酒店住过很多次的了，商务标间和豪华标间都住过。商务标间洗澡比豪华标间舒服，有个大花洒，不过浴缸都感觉不怎么干净，所以就没有用。酒店服务也不错。足浴的MM也不错，都挺漂亮的。早餐一般，将就着吃吃。酒店不远一条街，算是美食街吧，很多吃的，川菜特别多。总的感觉比临海另外一家四星的要好。,"This hotel has lived many times, and has lived in business bids and luxury standard rooms.Bathing in business standard rooms is more comfortable than luxury standards. There is a big shower, but the bathtub feels not very clean, so it is useless.The hotel service is also good.The MM of the foot bath is also good, it is pretty.Breakfast is average, and it will eat.The hotel is not far away. It is a food street. Many of them eat a lot of Sichuan cuisine.The general feeling is better than the other four -star of Linhai."
0,该酒店虽然名义上是五星，但我却没看过这么小气的酒店，我通过携程网预定了三千五百多的特级房，明明看到网上写得清清楚楚有赠送的饮料券每房不超过两张，可在登记入住时前台只给一张，真是郁闷！这不是纯粹虚假广告吗！！！我们是两人入住只给一张还不如不要给，前台解释说可以让另一个人买一张！！！简直是讹诈！！！,"Although the hotel is nominally five -star, I have never seen such a stingy hotel. I booked more than 3,500 special rooms through Ctrip.com.

1,"很安静,但隔音不好,早上旅客退房很吵.房间设施有些陈旧.但如果是平日入住,性价比还算合理.韶关有很多酒店,携程提供的太少","Very quiet, but the sound insulation is not good. In the morning, the passenger's check -in is very noisy.

0,除了便宜之外，基本再找不出其他什么优势，卫生间设施相当简陋，房间只有两个床头灯，没有宽带，偶尔能接收到附近居民家中的无线路由信号；所谓的双早是每个房间10块钱早餐券，仅有的几个品种均标有价格，连花生米都要卖到2块钱一碟，每个人超过5块钱后需现金支付。,"Except for cheap, you can't find any other advantages. The bathroom facilities are quite simple.

Even peanut rice costs 2 yuan for a plate of cake. Each person needs cash payment after more than 5 yuan."
0,打车太不方便，我在门口等了40分钟；早餐品种少。宽带还比较快！房间空调调不了。苏州还有一个茉莉花假日，下次试试。补充点评2008年4月22日：刚接到酒店预订部的电话，对所提的意见进行了跟踪反馈，赞一个。与我14日入住的上海华港雅阁酒店（虹桥机场）比起来，真是天壤之别。24日又到苏州，不过这次我已经预订了另外一家酒店，下次到苏州，我会考虑再次入住友联。希望真的已经改进。,"It's too inconvenient to take a taxi. I waited 40 minutes at the door; there were few breakfast varieties.Broadband is still faster!The room air conditioner cannot be adjusted.There is also a jasmine holiday in Suzhou, try next time.Supplementary comment on April 22, 2008: I just received a call from the hotel booking department and followed the feedback on the commemorative opinions and praised one.It is really different from the Shanghai Huagang Accord Hotel (Hongqiao Airport) I stayed on the 14th.I went to Suzhou on the 24th, but this time I have already booked another hotel.

1,"每次去杭州入住，有个很重要的原因就是因为四楼餐厅的菜比较好吃，很喜欢。不过，这次有些不快，入住当晚在餐厅用餐以后，询问服务员，得知第二天早饭结束时间为上午10：00，第二天睡懒觉到9：40多，赶紧起床到餐厅大约是9：55，询问服务台工作人员，得知早饭还没结束，于是付了18元（住店客人只需18）进去吃，结果发现服务员已经把盘子收的差不多了，剩点稀饭和几个茶叶蛋，还有一些橙汁，询问服务员，说结束了，并且她还在嘴里嘀咕怪服务台的人让我进去了，我当时很恼火，但忍住了没说。我觉得服务台的人员没错，因为确实还没到10：00（还差几分钟），既然没到，那就不该收盘子，不是吗？况且竟然已经收得差不多了。我可以理解服务员可能比较忙，因为中午接着又要开饭了，不过，我觉得这些差错不应该让客人来承担！而且发生了这不愉快的事也不来说声对不起，如果打个招呼我也算了，可是没有！当然，我也没说什么，忍了。但是我要在这里给你们餐厅管理人员一个建议：早饭到9：30结束，不再接待客人，10：00收盘子，在10：00之前要保证早餐正常供应。这不难做到的。不是吗？宾馆工作人员的服务态度还是一如既往不错的，只是汽车被刮了，也不知道是不是在宾馆地下停车场被刮，在保安热情的陪同下去看了停车场录像没找到原因，有点郁闷。当然，下次还会继续入住。宾馆反馈2008年6月18日：感谢您对我酒店的支持和爱护,对您本次在我酒店用餐时发生的不愉快,我们深表歉意.关于您的宝贵意见我们已要求餐厅及时整改,日常加强员工的服务意识培训,我们衷心期待您的再次光临.","Every time I go to Hangzhou, there is a very important reason because the dishes on the fourth floor restaurant are delicious and I like it very much.However, this time it was a bit unhappy. After dining at the restaurant that night, I asked the waiter. I learned that the end of the breakfast the next day was 10:00 in the morning, and I fell asleep at 9:40 the next day.Ask the staff of the service desk and learned that the breakfast was not over yet, so I paid 18 yuan (the guest store only needed 18) to eat, but found that the waiter had already collected the plate almost, and the leftover porridge and a few tea eggs were left.There are some orange juice, asking the waiter, saying that it was over, and the people who were still murmuring the service desk in her mouth asked me to go in. I was annoyed at the time, but she didn't say it.I think the staff of the service desk is right, because it has not yet reached 10:00 (still a few minutes). Since it hasn't arrived, it should not be closed, isn't it?Moreover, it was almost collected.I can understand that the waiter may be busy, because it is going to have a meal again at noon, but I think these errors should not let the guests bear it!And it's sorry for this unpleasant thing to happen. If you say hello, it's okay, but no!Of course, I didn't say anything, forbearing.But I want to give your restaurant managers a suggestion here: breakfast is over at 9:30, no more receiving guests, closing at 10:00, ensure that the breakfast is supplied normally before 10:00.It's not difficult to do.Isn't it?The service attitude of the hotel staff is as good as ever, but the car was scratched, and I don't know if it was scratched in the underground parking lot of the hotel. I accompanied the security guard to watch the parking lot and did not find the reason for the reason. It was a bit depressed.Of course, I will continue to stay next time.Hotel feedback on June 18, 2008: Thank you for your support and love for our hotel. We apologize for your unpleasantness of your hotel during the meal at my hotel.

1,这个宾馆最大的特色就是房费里含了一日三餐，虽然我这次晚到早走，只吃了一顿早饭。房间在当地算是不错的了。希望下次能吃到他们的免费午餐和晚餐。,"The biggest feature of this hotel is that the room fee contains three meals a day. Although I left early this time, I only ate a breakfast.The room is good in the local area.I hope to have their free lunch and dinner next time."

After visiting Huanglong during the day, I registered at 7 pm. As a result, the room door card had a problem, and I ran upstairs and downstairs to enter the room.When reservation, the credit card guarantee is forced.

0,我全说客观的，大家自己参考。1、酒店电话不能打外线，携程为什么不说明？2、拖鞋不是一次性的3、买点小东西不能计入房费，要单独结帐。4、我住的房间插座竟然掉在外面，是不是太不安全了。5、最关键服务态度就是招待所的态度。6、觉得不满意不能退房。补充点评2008年1月22日：7、早餐七点半供应，有点晚吧宾馆反馈2008年8月16日：感谢您的评价，我们己经将意义和建议反映给上级领导了，并且改进了服务，希望您下次入住时会真正体会到我们的进步。,"I said it is objective, everyone refers to it.1.

0,黑店！不折不扣的黑店！在该酒店被盗1万港币和2千多人民币，报案后警方调监控录象被告之对着我房间的那一部坏了，而且那天惟独我的房间没有清扫记录。而且酒店方没有任何由于他们的失职对客人造成的伤害而补偿的意思。建议慎重选择入住该酒店，如非要入住该酒店请把钱和贵重物品随身携带（因为该酒店没有配备保险箱）补充点评2007年11月15日：到现在6个月过去了，警察，酒店，携程都没有人给一个说法，今天携程来电话说酒店要求删除此点评，岂有此理！！本人所发点评完全是按照携程要求言之有物，言之有据，真实客观的，只是告戒要预定此垃圾酒店的朋友小心，不要重蹈我的覆辙，这样我这1万多元的损失也没白费。希望携程能真正站在客户的立场上对待此问题。宾馆反馈2007年11月19日：酒店接到客人报失财物后积极配合，于第一时间协助客人连同警方一起对此事展开了调查，警方查询该客人住房门卡出入纪录，结果表明，记录系统显示为当日无客房服务员进出房间打扫纪录，而全部是客人自己的房卡出入纪录，且酒店开业至今，前台一直配有保险箱，客人所说的没有保险箱更是与酒店实际情况不符！经过警方确认，此事店方无责任。,"Black shop!Non -fold black shop!The hotel was stolen by 10,000 Hong Kong dollars and more than 2,000 yuan.

The guests say that there is no safe to do not match the actual situation of the hotel!The police confirmed that the store was not responsible."
1,离开温泉酒店就入住了这间酒店，感觉就和一般的四星没什么两样，出入蛮方便的，最方便的是酒店对面有个海鲜大排挡，到那里吃海鲜很爽，各种海鲜都有，有很多都叫不出名字，不过都很好吃。,"After leaving the Hot Spring Hotel, I stayed in this hotel. It felt that it was no different from the average four -star. It was convenient to enter and exit. The most convenient thing was that there was a seafood gear opposite the hotel.

The tenants can go.On the other hand, the swimming pool is also eleven, and evening travel is also possible. It is really rich.On the other hand, there are also fitness rooms in the swimming pool. There are more than a dozen times. The best is to have colleagues and professors and support.The hotels near the hotel are very important, which is very important, and it also enhances my interest. Otherwise, it is best to complete the ticket after completing the hand.4. Traffic support: The hotel has a bus to and from the water and the state station.However, building everyone needs to check the hotel in advance. Because the most strange thing is that the place is not big or nearby, but in a blocking place. It is best to go to the hotel first.Because even if he does not necessarily know the class period or many people who are waiting for the guests.5.

When I got to the front desk, I said that the card may be put together with the mobile phone. It was inexplicable., And I have been holding it in my hand, why do I have my reason? I taught them a few words and changed the new card to enter the room. The most hateful thing was the next day.I ca n’t open it. I went to the front desk again to blame it. The reason was that the reason was that the front desk was wrong.My room apologized to my child and I brought my child a few cards of cartoon characters. Two of the same mistakes appeared in two days, it was really depressed!

1,酒店位置倒也好找，就在庆春路和中河路高架口上，苏宁电器对面。大堂不大，不过那天人不多，倒也清净。前台checkin速度也满快。住9楼标房，朝西，马路上的喧嚣也没什么影响。房间、床铺挺干净的，只是个人感觉床和枕头偏软，不习惯。酒店的隔音不是很好，走廊里的声音稍大些就听得很清楚。晚上刚睡着，几个孩子嬉闹而过，又被吵醒。然后，不知是哪里传来两个男人的对话声，叽叽咕咕的听不清，但也好一会没睡着。浴室的冲淋头是固定的，给宝宝洗澡不方便，对大人倒没什么影响。早餐我没有去吃，但同去的家人说品种不是很多，味道还可以。另外，宝宝午睡时把床尿湿，没来得及叫人来换我们就出去了，晚上9点多回来时，床铺已经换好了，还留了一张字条说明，给人感觉很温馨，在此也感谢酒店的优质服务。第二天退房的速度也很快。补充点评2007年10月8日：酒店4楼的东南亚风格的餐厅挺有味道的，听说里面的摆设都是老板从印尼买回来的。我们10个人消费了900多元，菜的味道不错，以粤菜为主，只是分量比较少，最后还是使劲吃饭填饱肚子：p,"The hotel location is easy to find, just on the elevated mouth of Qingchun Road and Zhonghe Road, opposite Suning Electric.The lobby is not big, but there are not many people that day, and it is clean.The speed of the front desk is also full of speed.Living on the 9th floor house, facing the west, the hustle and bustle on the road has no effect.The rooms and beds are very clean, but I personally feel that the bed and the pillow are soft and not used to it.The sound insulation of the hotel is not very good, and the sound in the corridor is a little louder.As soon as I fell asleep at night, a few children passed by, and they were awakened again.Then, I don't know where the two men came from the voice of the two men.The shower head of the bathroom is fixed. It is not convenient to take a bath for the baby, which has no effect on adults.I did n’t eat breakfast, but the family who went to say that there were not many varieties, and the taste was okay.In addition, when the baby takes a nap, the bed is wet, and we will go out without being able to change it. When we come back at 9 o'clock in the evening, the bed has been changed.Thank you also for the high -quality service of the hotel.The speed of checking out the next day is also very fast.Supplementary comment on October 8, 2007: The Southeast Asian -style restaurant on the 4th floor of the hotel is very delicious. I heard that the furnishings inside were bought by the boss from Indonesia.We spent more than 900 yuan in 10 people. The dishes have a good taste. They are mainly Cantonese cuisine, but the weight is relatively small. Finally, we eat hard and fill up."
0,"可能是因为订的是特惠大床房,空间相当小,厕所的空闲也很小,就在床边上.感觉真的是寸土寸金.酒店更像是公寓,隔音也不好,肯定一点就是还比较干净.宾馆反馈2008年7月21日：非常感谢您的评价，如果您需要更大的空间，下次入住时可以选择我们面积更大的豪华房或套房。隔音问题我们会立即检查并做改进。衷心希望您再次光临南浦瑞峰酒店。","It may be because it is a special bed room, the space is quite small, and the toilet is very small, just on the bed. It feels like it is really gold. The hotel is more like an apartment, and the sound insulation is not good.It is also relatively clean. Hotel feedback on July 21, 2008: Thank you very much for your evaluation. If you need a larger space, you can choose our larger luxury house or suite next time.We will check and improve the sound insulation problem immediately.I sincerely hope that you will visit the Ruifeng Hotel in Nanpu again."
1,"我订的是高级淑女房(双床),房间还算干净整洁，服务也还可以。早餐的种类有点少，但味道还行。办理退房的速度很快。总的来说，我和同事住得比较满意。","I ordered a high -end lady's room (double bed). The room was clean and tidy, and the service was okay.There are few types of breakfast, but the taste is okay.The speed of checking out is very fast.Overall, I live with my colleagues who live well."
1,我住的行政房是全新的，有五星级标准*v*。只可惜楼顶的中餐厅在停业装修，我挺喜欢这个餐厅的，正宗广东菜，希望下次来时复业了。似乎酒店花了很多精力在装修更新。,"The administrative house I live in is brand new, with five -star standard*V*.Unfortunately, the Chinese restaurant on the top of the building is being stopped and renovated. I like this restaurant, authentic Cantonese cuisine. I hope I will come back next time.It seems that the hotel has spent a lot of energy on renovation updates."
1,"酒店环境非常好，但是交通非常不方便,只能打车,或者走到山下坐118路公交也能到中心区和景点.附楼的标准间还是很干净的，200多的价格也很合理,不过,早餐真的是很难吃.而且,服务员的态度确实不好，尤其是前台的服务员.","The hotel environment is very good, but the transportation is very inconvenient. You can only take a taxi, or you can go to the mountains and take bus No. 118 to the central area and attractions. The standard room of the affiliated building is still very clean.Breakfast is really difficult to eat. Moreover, the attitude of the waiter is really bad, especially the waiter at the front desk."
1,不能给人什么深刻印象，老五星，价格比较低。。。可以入住。。,"Can't give people a deep impression, the old five stars, the price is relatively low.EssenceEssenceYou can check in.Essence"
1,房间很规整，也不像前面网友说的那么隔音不好，我住的是7楼标C，门脸儿很小但是都很安静的，周边交通很方便，打车到虹桥只要40多一点，20分钟就能到，而且打车到南京西路只要4公里，离火车站走路只要10分钟多点的样子，旁边就是汽车站，交通太方便，在上海住很多家旅店，这家价格和房间我最满意，以后一定还会入住！,"The room is very regular, and it is not as sound insulation as the netizens said. I live in the 7th floor marker C. The door face is very small but it is very quiet. The surrounding transportation is very convenient. It takes only 40 points to take a taxi to Hongqiao, 20 minutes in 20 minutes, 20 minutes in 20 minutes.You can get it, and take a taxi to Nanjing West Road only 4 kilometers. It takes only 10 minutes to walk from the train station. It is the bus station next to it. The transportation is too convenient. I live in many hotels in Shanghai., I will definitely stay in the future!"
0,酒店周末都系学生情侣入住，噪音实在恐怖，发现很多学生在前台的价格系120元哦.环境，设施实在系太差了!不建议住,"The hotel on the weekend is a student couple staying, and the noise is really horrible. It is found that the price of many students at the front desk is 120 yuan. The environment is too bad!"
1,酒店不在青岛最中心地段，不过交通还算方便。是一栋栋2-3层的小客房，环境非常好，还有花园，非常安静，是度假的好地方。酒店是什么国资委培训中心，开会的政府人员比较多，价格也比较实惠(最近青岛开奥运，酒店价格涨了好多)。酒店比较不算新，早餐一般，服务还可以。,"The hotel is not in the center of Qingdao, but the transportation is convenient.It is a small room with a 2-3-story floor. The environment is very good, as well as gardens, very quiet, and a good place for vacation.What is the training center of the State -owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, there are many government personnel who have met, and the price is relatively affordable (the recently opened Olympic Games, the hotel's price has risen a lot).The hotel is not new, breakfast is average, and the service is okay."
1,看到网上对该酒店的评论印象不是太好，但由于它距离火车站较近，交通十分便利，所以选择了这里，入住之后感觉还不错，服务人员彬彬有礼，服务热情，在入住期间发生的一件事更让我感到该酒店的人性化服务，那天我突发心脏病，酒店服务人员及时帮我拨打了120急救中心，并连续两天在医院陪我吸氧输液，并为我提供了可口的饭菜，给予我了无微不至的关怀，当我病情有些好转要返程时行李员还帮我买了回去的火车票，临行行李员还将我送上火车，我到家后还接到该酒店大堂副理的问候电话，关心的询问我的病情并叮嘱我多注意身体，我真的非常感动，华驿让我这个身处异地的外乡人感觉到家的温暖，今后我只要到哈尔滨一定要选择入住该酒店。,"Seeing that the hotel's comment on the hotel is not very good, but because it is close to the train station and the transportation is very convenient, I choose here. After check -in, the service staff is polite and enthusiastic.One thing made me feel the humanized service of the hotel. I had a sudden heart disease that day. The hotel service staff helped me dial the 120 emergency center in time, and accompanied me in the hospital for two consecutive days.The delicious meals gave me a meticulous care. When my condition improved a little, the luggage staff also helped me buy the train ticket for me. The luggage officer also sent me to the train. After I arrived home, I received it.The hotel's lobby deputy manager's greeting phone, asked about my condition and told me to pay more attention to my body. I was really very moved. Huayi made me a foreigner who was in a different place felt the warmth of the home. In the future, I only needed to go to Harbin.Choose to stay at the hotel."
1,"房间设施可以,但空间偏小,客房电梯很特别(没房卡上不去),很适合某些人使用(偷吃).....前台服务一般....","The room facilities are okay, but the space is small, the room elevator is very special (no room card can not be available), it is suitable for some people to use (stealing) ..... The front desk service is generally ..."
1,地段非常棒.住的是高级商务间.感觉房间有些小.另空调`的制冷效果也不行.不过门童和服务生很热情.而且有免费水果.地毯和装修有些陈旧~~~,"The location is great. It is a high -end business room. I feel that the room is a bit small. The refrigeration effect of the air conditioner `is not good. However, the gatekeeper and the waiter are very enthusiastic. And there are free fruits. The carpet and decoration are old ~~~"
1,"房间还是比较舒适的,酒店服务良好,大厅明亮整洁","The room is still more comfortable, the hotel service is good, the hall is bright and tidy"
1,位置比较好，到机场火车站都很方便。豪华单人间里的布置合理有序，独具匠心。值得一提的是门口迎宾员特别热情，帮我提箱子一直到办完入住还送我上了电梯。,"The location is better, and it is very convenient to go to the airport railway station.The layout in the luxury single room is reasonable and orderly.It is worth mentioning that the welcome members at the door were particularly enthusiastic, and helped me raise the box until I finished checking in and gave me the elevator."
1,"还不错的酒店,就是总体色调比较昏暗,可能是因为有些时日的原因吧~","The pretty hotel is that the overall color tone is relatively dim, maybe it is because of some days ~"
1,"酒店设施太旧,隔音效果差.还不及国内三星装潢早餐可以.服务也不错.交通不是非常便利.1000的价没竞争力","The hotel facilities are too old, and the sound insulation effect is poor. It's not as good as the domestic Samsung decoration breakfast. The service is also good. The transportation is not very convenient. The price of 1000 is not competitive."
1,"酒店环境还可以,相对在这片来说,大门面对校园内,非常幽静,晚间还可以散散步.吃饭也倒方便.室内陈设也还不错,但房间较小,不太通风.","The hotel environment is also okay. Relatively, the door is very quiet in the face of the campus, and you can take a walk in the evening. Eating is also convenient. The indoor furnishings are also good, but the room is small and it is not very ventilated."
0,住过很多大连酒店，这个酒店是最差的，客人在房间呆了一个小时不到的时间，酒店竟然收取了100元，大堂经理石金林态度恶劣，对客人恶言相向，没见过这样的酒店，劝大家千万不要住这个酒店。,"I have lived in many Dalian hotels. This hotel is the worst. Guests stayed in the room for less than an hour. The hotel received 100 yuan. The lobby manager Shi Jinlin had a bad attitude, and he was facing the guests. He had never seen such a hotel., Expect everyone not to stay in this hotel."
1,每次来都住这里，交通很方便，房间也宽敞。向大家推荐海景的房间，能看到深港跨海大桥和对面的香港景色。门口有漂亮MM迎宾，让人感觉眼前一亮，而且可以直接在酒店大堂办理值机，挺方便。我这次来不小心把手提电脑忘在了机场的推车上，幸亏酒店经理（一位会讲流利国语的老外）帮我及时联系机场失物招领处找了回来，真是很感谢。记得上次带国外的几个客户上到顶层法式餐厅用餐，那种情调和景致应该算PERFECT了，一边是深圳湾和西部通道，一边是中心区和迷人夜景，看得出外宾还是很ENJOY的，晚上有乐队表演，聊到很晚都不觉得。三楼的潮江春餐厅也很不错，菜做得很好吃，就是价格有点偏贵。我自己来还是会到二楼吃上海菜。强烈推荐，下次来还住这儿。,"Every time I come here, the traffic is very convenient and the room is spacious.Recommend the sea view room to everyone, you can see the deep -Hong Kong -crossing bridge and the Hong Kong view opposite.There is a beautiful MM welcoming at the door, which makes people feel bright, and it is convenient to apply for duty machines directly in the hotel lobby.This time I accidentally forgot to make a computer on the airport's cart. Fortunately, the hotel manager (a foreigner who can speak fluent Mandarin) helped me contact the airport to find out the property and find it back in time. I am very grateful.I remember the last time I took a few foreign customers to dine on the top -level French restaurant. That kind of mood and scenery should be considered as Perfect. On the one hand, there are Shenzhen Bay and West Channel.In the evening, there were bands performed, and I didn't feel it late.The Chajiang Spring Restaurant on the third floor is also very good. The dishes are delicious, but the price is a bit expensive.I still go to the second floor to eat Shanghai food.Strongly recommended, come here next time."
1,第二次入住没有前一次感觉好送的水果不新鲜,I did n’t feel fresh for the second time I did n’t feel fresh for the second time I did n’t feel fresh.
0,号称四星的酒店，可是房间之小，内部设施最多也就相当于Motel168，锦江之星等简易旅馆，真的让人大失所望...下次一定不会再住了,"The hotel called the four -star, but the room is small, and the internal facilities are at most equivalent to Motel168, Jinjiang Star and other simple hotels. It is really disappointing ... Next time, I will never live again"
0,服务还可以，硬件条件一般般，十分的吵，想睡个好觉的千万别住；火车站早已经搬家，坐火车也不方便，倒是晚上饿了吃东西很方便。呵呵，我只住了一晚就跑了。。。,"The service is okay. The hardware conditions are average. It is very noisy. Do n’t live if you want to sleep well. The railway station has already moved, and it is inconvenient to take the train. It is very convenient to eat at night.Hehe, I ran away only one night.EssenceEssence"
0,走廊上极噪估计是乌合之众的住所根本没睡好害得我考试时候晕糊糊的,The pole noise in the corridor is estimated that the residence of Wuhezhong has not slept well at all.
0,不好的，319房间有故臭味。要求换房说满了，我是3月去的。在路上认识了一个上海人，他说他退房前也住的319，也是一股臭味。而且这个去不掉，特别是晚上，很浓。不知道是厕所的还是窗外的。服务一般，门前有绿皮公交去莫高窟，不过敦煌宾馆也有，下次住敦煌宾馆。再也不住这个酒店了，热水要放半个小时才有。,"Not good, Room 319 has a stinky smell.I asked for a house to say full, I went in March.He met a Shanghai person on the road. He said that the 319 that he lived before checking out was also a smell.And this can't be removed, especially at night, very strong.I don't know if it is the toilet or the window.The service is average. There is a green leather bus to Mogao Grottoes in front of the door, but there are Dunhuang Hotel. The next time you live in Dunhuang Hotel.I can no longer hold this hotel, and hot water should be put in half an hour."
0,"房间小,风格老.特别是服务糟糕.我是3月初住的,当时房间空调吹冷风,跟服务员反映三次都没任何效果,管他们要被子也没有,差点把我冻感冒.本来是订的三天,结果第二天一起床就""落荒而逃"",去了五华.性价比太差.相比下五华好得多,同样的价格房子大了一半不止,而且风格很家庭化,特别是我住的是拐角处的房间,大弧度的落地玻璃将芙蓉路与河西景点应收眼底.","The room is small and the style is old. Especially the service is bad. I lived in early March. At that time, the room air conditioner blowing cold wind and reported that they had no effect three times with the waiter.Three days, the bed was ""fled and fled"" the next day, and went to Wuhua. The price / performance ratio was too bad. Compared with the next five Hua, the same price was more than half of the house, and the style was very family.I live in the room at the corner. The large curved floor glass can see Furong Road and Hexi scenic spots."
1,晕~~~搞不懂。我去上清寺地区办事，准备选择东方花园饭店和雾都宾馆，我一下飞机，携程推销员向我推荐雾都宾馆，说东方花苑满房，并且停水停电，最后我选择了雾都宾馆，可是雾都房间小，周边生活很不方便，也没有什么超市商场，酒店管理和服务都不好，第二天，我想换酒店，可是头天推销员对我讲东方花苑都满房并且经常停电和没有热水，但我又要在这个区域办事，然后我就打电话去酒店，告之有房间并且一切正常，打电话到携程，又被确认了，不知该推销员是怎么搞的？？东方花苑服务好、房间够宽敞舒适，周边有3家大型超市，还有很多重庆小吃店，关键是晚餐陪客户喝酒没吃什么东西，附近吃夜宵很方便。,"Halo ~~~ I don't understand.I went to the Shangqing Temple area to work and prepared to choose the Oriental Garden Hotel and the Wusu Hotel. I got off the plane. Ctrip salesperson recommended the Wugu Hotel to me, saying that Dongfang Flower Garden was full of houses, and water was stopped. Finally, I chose the Wudu Hotel, But the foggy rooms are small, the surrounding life is very inconvenient, and there are no supermarket shopping malls. The hotel management and services are not good. The next day, I want to change the hotel, but the salesperson said to me the previous day.Frequent power outages and no hot water, but I have to do things in this area, and then I call to the hotel, tell the room and everything is normal, call Ctrip, and be confirmed. I wonder how the salesperson did.IntersectionIntersectionDongfang Flower Garden has good service and spacious rooms. There are 3 large supermarkets around them, and many Chongqing snack bars. The key is that dinner accompanies customers to drink without eating anything. It is convenient to eat supper nearby."
0,"很遗憾,不清楚万达集团用了什么装修材料,整个Hotel到处弥漫着刺鼻的油漆味,在我入住之前,已经有朋友警告过我,但我还是没有想到雅高集团的管理会疏忽到这样的地步,住进去以后只有打开","Unfortunately, it is unclear what decoration materials Wanda Group has used. The entire hotel is filled with a pungent paint. Before I stayed, my friends had warned me, but I still did not expect that the management of Yaogao Group would neglect like this to this.At the point, only open after living in"
1,名头特别响亮，不过设施可不怎么样，尤其是单人大床房，居然没有安静的房间。入住后只好更换为双人间。,"The name is particularly loud, but the facilities are not good, especially the single bedroom, there are no quiet rooms.After staying, I had to change to a double room."
1,环境还行。服务质量不高～～前台接待员缺乏礼貌用语，行李没有服务员运送，也没有导行的服务员。进了酒店要自己做所有的事，包括找自己的房间。,"The environment is okay.The quality of service is not high ~~ The front desk reception staff lacks polite words, luggage has no waiter transportation, and there are no waiters for guidance.When you enter the hotel, you need to do everything yourself, including finding your own room."
1,大堂小了点，房间挺干净，价钱不错。现在前门有快速公交半小时可以到了，蛮方便。房间还有免费上网的，不过网速慢了点。,"The lobby is a little smaller, the room is very clean, and the price is good.Now there are fast buses in the front door for half an hour, which is convenient.There are still free Internet access in the room, but the speed is slower."
0,我是11月份去住的，当时见网上评价不错。但到了才发现，总体感觉比较脏，11月份的北方天气了，房间内竟然还有苍蝇！下午打死两只，第二天早上，发现房间内竟然还有一只。更可怕的是，晚上睡前打死一只蚊子，到睡时，还有一只一直在骚扰我，一直到半夜才迷迷糊糊睡着，也不知那蚊子到底咬我多少血。补充点评2007年11月20日：房间内有难闻的味道！但前台服务员的服务还是不错的。,"I went to live in November, and I saw that the online evaluation was good.But when I got it, I found that the overall feeling was relatively dirty. In November, there were flies in the room!Killed two in the afternoon, and the next morning, I found that there was even one in the room.What is even more terrible is that he killed a mosquito before going to bed at night. When I went to bed, there was another one who had been harassed me. It was not until midnight that I fell asleep in the middle of the night. I didn't know how much the mosquito bites me.Supplementary comment November 20, 2007: There is a bad taste in the room!But the service of the front desk is still good."
0,"新酒店的内部各方面都不错.服务也还行.行李生不会帮客人拿行李,只能自己拎上拎下那台阶.最不好的是,旁边一施工工程(海景房对着),日夜奋战呀!!!睡着了,也会给吵醒!还有夜间工地汽车喇叭声!下回最起码也得等这工程完毕才能住.","The internal aspects of the new hotel are good. The service is OK. Luggage will not help the guests get the luggage, and can only take the steps by themselves. The worst is the construction project next toFighting day and night !!! I fell asleep, I will also wake up! There is also the sound of car horn at night! At the at least, I have to wait for this project to finish it before I can live."
1,这次去是在香港挂黑色暴雨警报那天，本想取消的，但是之前给携程打电话想取消，携程和酒店沟通后说是不可以，只好冒雨前去。结果去了才知道，原来我们活动的区域没雨。去时跟酒店前台说要层数高的，结果安排了27楼，很担心是民居中间，结果很满意，可以看到很远的地方，是个行政套房。卫生间真的是没让我出乎意料的小，但是干净整洁。交通相当方便，离地铁站很近，关键要摸清小路的走法。对酒店整体感觉满意，下次去还会考虑再次入住。但是在后面的确认阶段携程的效率太低下，从定单状态错误投诉到最终确认，已经过去了2个星期。,"This time, I wanted to cancel the day when the black rainstorm alert was hung in Hong Kong, but I called Ctrip to cancel it before. After communicating with the hotel, Ctrip said that it was not possible, so I had to go to the rain.As a result, I learned that there was no rain in the area of our activity.When I went, I said that the number of layers should be high. As a result, the 27th floor was arranged. I was worried that it was the middle of the residential house. The result was very satisfied. You can see a far place. It is an administrative suite.The bathroom really did not make me unexpected, but clean and tidy.The transportation is quite convenient, and it is very close to the subway station.I am satisfied with the hotel as a whole, and I will consider staying again next time.However, in the subsequent confirmation stage, Ctrip's efficiency was too low. From the wrong complaint of the order state to the final confirmation, it has passed 2 weeks."
1,真的是独栋别墅，我住的是每栋6间房，可惜没有了大床房。装修有点旧了，周边环境很好，适合休闲度假，这个价位超值了,"It is really a single villa. I live in 6 rooms in each building. Unfortunately, there is no big bed room.The decoration is a bit old, the surrounding environment is very good, suitable for leisure vacation, this price is value -for -money"
1,随便报一家酒店的合作单位，得到的价格都比携程的低。看来携程要作作工作了。,"Just report to the cooperative unit of a hotel, and the price is lower than Ctrip.It seems that Ctrip is going to work."
0,酒店太脏、太旧、太破！房间厕所都是下水道的臭味！地毯已经旧的看不清楚颜色了。电视机只有6个频道！我真是晕哦！前台服务员都是坐着看着报纸工作的，而且前台只有1个服务员。客房服务员不敲门就开门进来的，受不了哦！！,"The hotel is too dirty, too old, and too broken!The toilets in the room are all the odor of the sewer!The carpet is old and the color is not clear.There are only 6 channels on the TV!I'm really dizzy!The waiters at the front desk are sitting and watching the newspaper, and there are only one waiter at the front desk.The room waiter opened the door without knocking on the door, can't stand it!Intersection"
1,去了几次了.这次住的是温泉去里的日式东瀛阁.房间比较大.3楼的还有露台.泡温泉比较方便.在房间里换了衣服就能直接下去.中餐厅的出品还是一如既往的好.价钱也比较公道.值得推荐.不过.餐厅门口的保安服务态度不敢恭为.实在是大煞风景,"I went to a few times. This time I lived in the Japanese -style East Pavilion where the hot spring went. The room was relatively large. The 3rd floor also has a terrace. It is more convenient to make hot springs.The production is still good as ever. The price is more fair. It is worth recommending. However, the security service attitude of the restaurant door is not respectful."
0,"通过携程订房此酒店的确派人到机场接了我一个人,考虑到他们热情,我专门比原订的三天多住了一天,但走的那天叫送到火车站就不干了,搞得我早上提了行李在酒店门口等了约二十多分钟还没见到出租车,最后坐了三块钱的三轮车到布达拉宫门口再转的出租车.还有就是在走时结账,那服务员(发票签名友珍)收了我当时入住时的收据100元,因开发票,走时没退回我一百元(消费了二支矿泉水实际应90元),打过多次电话,都没与答复,管理方面还是存在一定问题.住了四天,只两天打扫了房间.补充点评2007年7月4日：等闽泰酒店给我一答复后我再给予正确的评价","Through Ctrip's booking, this hotel did send someone to the airport to pick me up alone. Considering that they were enthusiastic, I lived more than the original three days, but the day of walking was called to the train station.I mentioned my luggage in the morning and waited at the hotel door for about 20 minutes. I haven't seen a taxi. Finally, I took a three -wheeled tricycle to the taxi at the door of the Potala Palace.The waiter (Signature Youzhen) received the receipt of 100 yuan when I stayed at the time. Due to the invoicing, I did not return to my 100 yuan when I left (the two mineral water should actually be 90 yuan).In terms of answers, there are still certain problems in management. I lived for four days and cleaned the room for only two days. Supplementary review July 4, 2007: After the Mintea Hotel answers to me, I will give the correct evaluation again"
1,酒店还好吧，就是一楼的中餐馆上菜速度暴慢。房间里面有电脑，比较方便一些。,"The hotel is okay, the speed of Chinese restaurants on the first floor is slow.There is a computer in the room, which is more convenient."
1,该酒店对去溧阳公务或旅游的人都很适合，自助早餐很丰富，酒店内部环境和服务很好。唯一的不足是酒店大门口在晚上时太乱，各种车辆和人在门口挤成一团。补充点评2008年5月9日：房间淋浴水压不稳，一会热、一会冷，很不好调整。宾馆反馈2008年5月13日：非常感谢您选择入住金陵溧阳宾馆。您给予我们的肯定与赞赏让我们倍受鼓舞，也使我们更加自信地去做好每一天的服务工作。正是有许多像您一样的宾客给予我们不断的鼓励和赞赏，酒店的服务品质才能得以不断提升。对于酒店大门口的秩序和房间淋浴水的问题我们已做出了相应的措施。再次向您表示我们最衷心的感谢！我们期待您的再次光临！,"The hotel is very suitable for people who go to Puyang officials or travel. The buffet breakfast is very rich, and the internal environment and services of the hotel are very good.The only deficiency was that the hotel's gate was too chaotic at night, and various vehicles and people squeezed into a ball at the door.Supplementary comment on May 9, 2008: The water pressure in the room is unstable.Hotel feedback on May 13, 2008: Thank you very much for choosing to stay in the Jinling Puyang Hotel.The affirmation and appreciation you give us will be encouraged, and it also makes us more confidently do the service work every day.It is many guests like you give us continuous encouragement and appreciation that the quality of the hotel's service can be continuously improved.We have taken corresponding measures on the order of the hotel's gate and the problem of room shower water.I will tell you again for your heartfelt thanks!We look forward to your visit again!"
1,"订购中山国际大酒店一是看朋友们的点评，二是因为当天再订马可波罗假日酒店它的459特双床房(特惠)涨了一百，于是决心试试新鲜！总体感觉房间硬件不错，前台和房间的服务也很好，比马可波罗假日酒店并不差，没有其它朋友说的服务生硬之嫌！呵呵，可能一个人一个品味吧！这次入住让我感觉中山国际大酒店的老总好像没有找到一位现代企业管理经理，我提前两天订购的双床房(特惠)价格是359单早，到了入住当天一看变成了319无早，如果加一一位38早餐才357,比我两天前订的还要便宜。莫名其妙！再看358的高级房还有单早，还比双床房(特惠)大5个平方，索性修改订单改成了高级房。早餐可是我吃过的三星早最差的一次，完全没有某位朋友说的准四星水平。38元的东东，除了水果以外，没有一样儿算有特色。白粥有泡水的嫌疑，幸亏没吃现煮混沌，因为粥未喝完发现现煮混沌的师傅端着锅从洗手间门口的洗手台走出来，后面一位村干部模样的人正在大声擤鼻涕，不知是不是厨房的水管坏了？哈哈早餐厅里有个下一楼的转梯，正上房水渍斑驭，还有一供财神香烟缭绕，让人以为来了到某个乡下的小店！酒店位置很好，机场大巴落客点就在门口，前台代售车票；步行到西湖15分钟不到，知味观总店也在同一方向。在友好门口有自行车出租，一个小时内不收费，我们玩了6个小时，一部车子收费9元。很爽！以后会住，但坚决不再去吃早餐了，去知味观每个人5元豆浆油条更爽些！注明，服务的3分是前台与房间的5分和餐厅的1分平均的！","Ordering Zhongshan International Hotel is to watch the comments from friends, and the other is because the 459 special double bed (special offer) of the Mark Polo Holiday Hotel has risen by one hundred that day, so he is determined to try fresh!Overall feels that the hardware of the room is good, and the front desk and room services are also very good. It is not bad than the Marco Polo Holiday Hotel. No other friends say that the waiter is hard!Haha, maybe one person has a taste!This time I moved to me that the boss of Zhongshan International Hotel did not seem to have found a modern enterprise management manager. The price of double bed (special) ordered two days in advance was 359.Early, if you add 38 breakfast for 357, it is cheaper than I booked two days ago.baffling!Look at the 358 high -end room, there are also a single morning, and 5 square meters larger than the double bed room (special), and the order is simply modified to change to high -end rooms.Breakfast is the worst time I have eaten Samsung, and there is no quasi -four -star level that a friend said at all.East of 38 yuan, except for fruits, is not the same.The white porridge was suspected of soaking water. Fortunately, I did n’t eat the chaos of cooking, because the porridge did not find that the chaotic master came out of the bathroom at the door of the bathroom with the pot.I wonder if the water pipe in the kitchen is broken?Haha's breakfast has a ladder on the next floor. The water is on the water stains, and there is a cigarette for wealth, so that people think that they come to a small shop in a certain countryside!The hotel location is very good. The airport bus is at the door at the door and sells tickets on the front desk. It is less than 15 minutes walk to West Lake.There is a bicycle rental at the friendly door. Without charging within an hour, we played for 6 hours and a car charged 9 yuan.Very cool!I will live in the future, but I will not go to breakfast anymore. To know Weifu, each person is 5 yuan soymilk churros!It is indicated that the 3 points of the service are 5 points in the front desk and the room and the average of the restaurant!"
1,这次是第3次去碧水湾泡温泉，不过是第一次选择住在度假村里，此次入住感觉真的很不错，就像携程介绍的，服务很注意细节，欢迎水果、功夫茶还有客房书桌上的书架都让人感觉很舒服。温泉也仍然保持了高水准的服务，这一点也很难得的，都好几年了，服务水平一点都没有下降，服务员的服务意识都很强，毛巾供应在人很多的时候都很充足（感觉这一点对泡温泉好重要的哦，毛巾不够会好冷的哦）。唯一美中不足的是大床房全部都是朝公路那边的，朝山景的那边只有双床房，订房的时候就发现这个问题了，但还是想要大床房，结果发现朝公路还是有少少噪音的。。要是酒店在两边都安排各种房型给客人多点选择就好了,"This time is the third time I went to Bishui Bay Hot Spring, but I chose to live in the resort for the first time. This time I feel really good. Like Ctrip introduced, the services are very important to pay attention to details. Welcome to fruit, Kung Fu tea, and guest rooms.The bookshelves on the desk make people feel comfortable.Hot spring still maintains high -level services. This is also rare. It has been several years. The service level has not declined at all. The waiter has a strong sense of service.It is important to soak hot springs, the towels will not be cold enough).The only beauty is that the big bed rooms are all facing the road. There are only double beds on the other side of the mountain view. I found this problem when reservation, but I still want a large bed room.Noise.EssenceIf the hotel arranges a variety of room types on both sides, it is better to choose a multi -point choice for guests"
0,关于携程：携程在如家的价格谈判能力值得怀疑，这次订的是套房，通过携程订价格289，网上未显示门市价格。到了如家局前店后发现门市价为299元，携程价格仅优惠10元。再后来常州的朋友（就住在如家旁边）告诉我，如果直接预定，能轻松打到240-250的价格折扣。这样我就非常怀疑携程的价格谈判能力了，通过携程预定是为了经济，但拿到的价格之比公开的门市价低10元，根本不具备价格优势，甚至通过当地的朋友都能拿到比携程更便宜的价格，那我们还用携程干什么？关于酒店：套房设施太为陈旧，实在与289的价格不符，尤其是一楼客厅的沙发，简直是房间的最大败笔，灰绿色的沙发，实在很像从垃圾堆里检出来的。套房在1层，是上下层的复式结构，上层无窗户，下层有窗户，窗户外1米是一堵高墙，可以依稀透进来一点光线，感觉就是地下室。睡觉前在屋子里拍蚊子，拍死不下20只。住如家住了不少店，这样的房间还是第一次遭遇，出游不想影响心情，所以回来后再投诉，希望如家和携程能有所反馈。,"Regarding Ctrip: Ctrip's ability to negotiate at Rujia's price is doubtful. This time, the suite is booked, and the price of the setting is 289 through the Ctrip, and the store price is not displayed on the Internet.After the front store of the Rujia Bureau, it was found that the store price was 299 yuan, and the price of Ctrip was only 10 yuan.Later, friends from Changzhou (just beside Rujia) told me that if you book it directly, you can easily hit the price discount of 240-250.In this way, I am very doubtful that Ctrip’s price negotiation ability is very low. Through Ctrip is scheduled for the economy, the price of the price is 10 yuan lower than the public store price, and it does not have the price advantage at all.Ctrip is cheaper, so what do we use to do with Ctrip?Regarding the hotel: The suite facility is too old, and it is really inconsistent with the price of 289. Especially the sofa of the living room on the first floor is simply the biggest defeat in the room. The gray -green sofa is really like it was tested from the garbage dump.The suite is on the 1st floor. It is a duplex structure of the upper and lower layers. There is no window on the upper layer. The lower layer has windows. 1 meter outdoors is a high wall. It can be attacked in a little light. It feels like the basement.Before going to bed, patting mosquitoes in the room, not to shoot 20.I lived in a lot of shops in the home. Such a room was still encountered for the first time. I did n’t want to affect my mood, so I complained after I came back."
1,顶的双人房，我们下飞机做大巴，然后打的到的，宾馆外面不怎么杨，里面就不错了，冷气足，房间里面也不错，总体感觉不错，对面就是海鲜一条街，哪个吃的爽的，200块2个人吃的来是走不动了哈哈，酒店有班车直接到香港的，不错哦,"The double room of the top, we got off the plane to do the bus, and then hit it. The outside of the hotel is not very populated. It is good inside, air -conditioned, the room is good, and the overall feels good. The opposite is a seafood street.For 200 people, 2 people can't move. Haha, there are bus in the hotel directly to Hong Kong, good"
1,"环境还不错滴~~就是入住时发生了一点小小的意外!预定是用英文名字预定的,登记的时候出示的是中文名字,被告知无此人预定!吓偶一跳!呵呵~","The environment is not bad ~~ There is a little accident when you check in! The booking is booked in English. The Chinese name is shown when registering, and the person is told that no one is scary! Haha ~"

The sound of the bath next door and the sound of speaking are very clear. The sound of people walking, opening, and closing the door in the corridor is also very clear."
1,"房间中规中矩,但看不出是去年装修的,包括公共区域的设备设施.可能是保养没有做到位.服务人员情况良好,前台的服务生较热情,赠送的水果一份居然是两个梨.总体感觉一般.没有四星水准.","The room is quite satisfactory, but it cannot be seen last year's renovation, including equipment and facilities in public areas. It may be that the maintenance is not in place. The service staff is good, and the waiters at the front desk are more enthusiastic.It feels average. There is no four -star level."
0,很破的宾馆，号称四星不过实际的情况比好一点的2星都差，早饭也是惨不忍睹。,"The very broken hotel, known as the four stars, but the actual situation is worse than the actual situation, and breakfast is terrible."
0,"关于这次入住情况,不想在这花太多篇幅评论,只是简单说一下情况,希望以后携程遇到这样的情况,要启动快速反应机制处理,以免耽误行程.因为是夜班机的关系,我是凌晨两点到酒店的,在疲惫不堪的情况下,按照预定的时间来到宾馆,在前台上叫了十分钟才有人从后面出来,还是睡不醒的样子.我报了名字后,她说查不到我是携程定的房,但后来又说有,于是我就快快办好手续就入住了,住了两天,退房时竟然比我预定的198房价多了80元,前台的解释是当时没有198的,就给了我这种房型,我住的房型叫商务大床房,竟然只有大概5个平方!我问难道还有比这更小的吗?回答是有的,马上晕倒!~~~~~~~~最后的协调结果是我等了两个半小时,打了携程六七个电话后才解决,问题是解决了,但相当不愉快.","Regarding the situation of this check -in, I don't want to spend too much comments in this time, but just talk about the situation briefly. I hope that Ctrip encounters such a situation in the future, to start the rapid response mechanism processing to avoid delaying the itinerary. Because it is the relationship between the night class, I am the relationship between me, I am the relationshipAt two o'clock in the morning, when I was exhausted, I came to the hotel according to the scheduled time. After ten minutes on the front desk, someone came out from behind and couldn't sleep. After I reported the name, she said.I couldn't find that I was a Ctrip's house, but later I said, so I quickly went through the formalities and stayed in for two days. When I left the room, it was 80 yuan more than the 198 house I scheduled.The explanation was that there was no 198 at that time, so I gave me a room type. The room type I lived in was called a large business bed room, but there were only about 5 square meters! I asked, is there any smaller than this?Fainted! ~~~~~~~~ The final coordination result was that I waited for two and a half hours, and I solved it after making six or seven calls. The problem was solved, but it was quite unpleasant."
1,房间有些陈旧！不过还算舒适，交通也方便。,The room is a little old!But it is comfortable and convenient for transportation.
1,很满意的酒店设施和服务都不错以后会常来,Very satisfactory hotel facilities and services are good in the future
1,1、先说好的。房间够大，也很干净和安静。服务员态度不错，我提出要看当地地图，她们立即就送了一份到房间来。2、再说差的。酒店的空调不够冷，半夜把我都热醒了，打电话反映过也没有改进。估计是酒店为省电，夜里只是送风而不制冷。对于一个四星级酒店来说，很不应该！最好笑的是，房间里居然连一瓶纯净水都不舍得送，客人要喝水要么自己烧，要么就取冰箱里付费的。太抠门了吧！,"1. Let's talk about it first.The room is large enough, and it is very clean and quiet.The waiter has a good attitude. I proposed to see the local map, and they immediately sent a copy to the room.2. By saying bad.The hotel's air conditioner was not cold enough, and I woke up in the middle of the night, and the phone call has not improved.It is estimated that the hotel is a power saving, and it is just giving air off the air without refrigerating at night.For a four -star hotel, it shouldn't be!The funny thing is that there is even a bottle of pure water in the room. The guests have to drink water or burn themselves or pay in the refrigerator.Too much!"
1,我是十月二号住的，各方面的设施还不错，离太古城很近还有酒店免费BUS，值的！,"I lived on October 2nd, and the facilities in all aspects are not bad. There are free BUSs in Taikoo City, and there are free BUS in the hotel!"
1,"一家4星级酒店,豪华房价格不菲,房间太小气.酒店的服务到还算不错,因为豪华无烟房非常少,讨论一番之后同意免费升级房间.只是在4星而言,这样的价格有些偏贵,不如去住喜来登之类的5星饭店.","A 4 -star hotel, luxury rooms are expensive, the room is too stingy. The service of the hotel is pretty good, because there are very few luxury smoke -free rooms. After discussing it, I agree to upgrade the room for free.The price is a bit expensive."

1,位置很好，走路到文庙、清凉寺5分钟都用不了，周边公交车很多很方便，就是出租车不太爱去（老城区路窄爱堵车），因为是老宾馆所以设施要陈旧些，,"The location is very good. Walking to Wenmiao and Qingliang Temple can not be used for 5 minutes. There are many convenient buses around. It is because taxis do not like to go (the road of narrow love in the old city road), because it is an old hotel, the facilities should be older."
1,国庆住了几天，总的来说还可以。交通：应该是很方便，紧挨着三环，离光熙门城铁站特近，步行不到10分钟，就是路不好找，城铁附近正施工，携程短信上的地址严重失误，什么城铁站向北十五米，害我找了好几圈，所以最好向路人打听。住房：厕所比较小，但很干净，卫浴也不错“箭牌”，热水很足。室内装修简介明快，就是墙皮该刷了，很多都脱落了，床一般有点硬，能感觉到弹簧，不过我比较喜欢睡硬床。服务：相当一般般。吃饭：附近吃饭地点还是很多的，蟹老宋、全聚德、羊蝎子等等。。,"I have lived on National Day for a few days, and in general.Transportation: It should be very convenient. It is next to the Three Ring Road, which is close to the Railway Station of Guangximen City. It is less than 10 minutes walking.The urban railway station fifteen meters north, and I found several laps, so it is best to ask passersby.Housing: The toilet is relatively small, but it is very clean, the bathroom is also good ""arrow"", and the hot water is sufficient.Introduction to the interior decoration is clear, that is, the wall skin should be brushed, and many of them fall off. The beds are generally a bit hard and can feel spring, but I prefer to sleep hard bed.Service: Quite ordinary.Eating: There are still many sites nearby, Crab Lao Song, Quan Jide, sheep scorpion, and so on.Essence"

1,6月入住过，感觉还不错，是一个适合商务入住的宾馆。,I stayed in June and felt pretty good. It was a hotel suitable for business.
0,这个小店可能是因为在使馆区，住的外国人比较多，服务态度就差了一点，素质比较低，对于签名还要问你：这是写的什么啊，我都不认识。入住首先就让你签订一个贵重物品丢失不赔的协议，给你的第一感觉就是一种不安全感，以至于我们出去吃饭的时候，都把笔记本电脑背上。本来预定了3天，住了一个晚上，第二天赶快跑吧，以后是不会再去了。还不能刷卡，招待所都不如。,"This small shop may be because there are more foreigners living in the embassy area, and the service attitude is a bit worse. The quality is relatively low. I have to ask you for the signature: I do n’t know what this is written.First of all, let you sign an agreement to sign a valuable item. The first feeling to give you is a sense of insecurity, so that when we go out for dinner, we will carry the laptop.I had been scheduled for 3 days, lived for one night, and ran the next day, and I won't go again in the future.Can't swipe the card, the hostel is not as good as."

0,房间很小，洗手间不干净，我住的标间，浴缸里面脏死了，我都不敢站，而且下水的速度好慢啊，不过地处北京丰台区，做公车20分钟就可以到前门，服务员的态度还是很好的。但相比如家、锦江之星，这里真不像是连锁的，就是一个旅馆。,"The room is very small, and the bathroom is not clean. I live in the standard room and dirty in the bathtub. I dare not stand, and the speed of launching is very slow. However, it is located in Fengtai District, Beijing.The waiter's attitude is still very good.But compared to the star and Jinjiang star, it is really not like a chain, it is a hotel."
0,在佳木斯这个地方我还有什么选择？没有热水，其他都还好。他们说的热水就是相对与冰冷的冷水而言的，早晚其实都没有能舒服洗澡的热水的。,"What other choices do I have in this place?No hot water, everything else is okay.The hot water they said is relatively cold and cold water. In fact, there is no hot water that can be comfortable in the morning and evening."

1,离西湖景区比较近，走路几分钟就到，附近吃饭、逛街都方便。房间装修比较新，接待会议的客人比较多。比较不好的是门口老有搭客的司机兜生意。总之，性价比不错。宾馆反馈2008年7月17日：尊敬的宾客，非常感谢您对我们饭店的点评。对于您提出的问题，我们已让饭店安全部严加查管，尽量避免司机在饭店门口拉生意的现象。给您造成的不便，我们在此深表歉意，希望您再次光临！,"It is closer to the West Lake Scenic Area. It takes a few minutes to walk. It is convenient to eat and go shopping nearby.The room decoration is relatively new, and there are more guests who receive the meeting.What is not good is that there are always passengers at the door.In short, the cost performance is good.Hotel feedback on July 17, 2008: Dear guests, thank you very much for your reviews of our hotel.For your questions, we have asked the Ministry of Safety of the Hotel to investigate and try to avoid drivers from pulling business at the hotel door.The inconvenience caused by you, we apologize here, hope you will come again!"
1,总体来说度过了一个非常愉快的周末。1。酒店的地理位置很好，一个酒店就是一座岛。通往小岛的路也是曲径通幽，路边景色很美。喜欢。2。整个酒店有个很大的特色，一进门就是道教的64八卦图，并且，在山下的石头上刻了一部道德经。3。酒店的环境很好，成片的后草皮，而且干净，随便躺躺睡睡都可以.4.酒店有自己的游船，不过价格贵，640元一条船。5。酒店的餐厅，菜味道不错，而且价格不贵，鱼头汤108/小份，但是4-5个人也够了，其他的菜大部分也都是20快左右。6.住的是9号楼的湖景房，有阳台的，真的象住在水中一样。7.有开房水果赠送，而且服务员态度也不错。见面都打招呼的，但是房间内部实在不能让人满意，可能是老5星级的关系，房间装修顶多只能算是4星，而且，9号楼没有大床，不过我们把床拼起来了，也算是个大床房。8。酒店ktv很贵，640最低消费，脚摩70/人。9.夏天的晚上，夜朗星不稀，晚上12点可以看到非常非常多的星星，而且还看到一颗流星。。。总之，个人觉得这个酒店真的不错，家庭旅游非常好。以后还会选择入住。,"Overall a very pleasant weekend.1.The hotel's geographical location is very good, a hotel is an island.The road leading to the island is also quiet, and the roadside scenery is beautiful.like.2.The entire hotel has a big characteristic. As soon as you enter the door, it is the 64 gossip map of Taoism, and a moral scripture is engraved on the stones under the mountain.3.The environment of the hotel is very good. The latter -made grass skin, and it is clean. You can lie down and sleep casually .4. The hotel has its own cruise ship, but the price is expensive, 640 yuan a boat.5.The restaurant in the hotel has good dishes, and the price is not expensive. The fish head soup is 108/small, but 4-5 people are enough. Most of the other dishes are about 20 fast.6.

1,第三次入住了，觉得还不错，正好碰上了地震，楼层低感觉不明显。希望四川尽快从灾情中恢复过来！,"The third time I stayed, I felt pretty good. I just met the earthquake. The low floor was not obvious.I hope Sichuan will recover from the disaster as soon as possible!"
1,本来订的是天和玉大酒店的三人间，酒店说给了一个套房加了二张床，本来挺高兴的，进去一看，设备极简陋，套房厅里啥都没有，卫生间还脏，房间又差，赶紧逃出来，三个人查了半天，订了良运的套房加床。订单十分钟确认，马上赶过去，房间是榉木装修显的陈旧，但其实是很干净的，设备也不算旧，电视机很大，床软且舒服，有免费地图，卫生间干净，用品一般，服务态度不错，周边几步路就是一心烤肉和大清花，打的去极地馆十五元，去星海广场二十，去机场三十。,"Originally, the three rooms of the Tianhe Yuga Hotel were booked. The hotel said that I added two beds to a suite. It was very happy. When I went in, the equipment was very simple, there was nothing in the suite hall, the bathroom was dirty, the room was still dirty, the room was still dirty, the room was still dirty, the room was still dirty, the room was still dirty, the room was still dirty, the room was still dirty, the room was still dirty, the room was still dirty, the room was still dirty, the room was still dirty, the room was still dirty, the room was still dirty, the room was still dirty, the room was still dirty, the room was still dirty, the room was still dirty, the room was still dirty, the room was still dirty, the room was still dirty, the room was still dirty.It's bad, and quickly escaped.

A few steps around are the heart barbecue and Daqing flowers. They go to the polar museum fifteen yuan, go to Xinghai Plaza twenty, and go to the airport thirty."
1,服务态度很好，当晚中央空调没有开，挺凉的，还好订的标准间，盖了两个被子；早餐可吃的不是太多，价格太贵。,"The service attitude is very good. The central air conditioner was not turned on that night. It was cool. Fortunately, the standard room was covered with two quilts; the breakfast could not eat too much, the price was too expensive."

0,12月4日～7日我们一行7人住进了皇嘉，给我和同事感觉都不好，一房间没有暖气，而且换房间态度不好，房间换后还是没有暖气；二房间卫生间设施差，台盆龙头出水很小，洗澡淋浴区，下水不畅，设施陈旧，卫生间洗澡环境很冷；三早餐尚可。希望皇嘉应该重新装修，现在的房间设施和服务不符合4星级的标准和要求。,"From December 4th to 7th, 7 of us lived in Huangjia, and felt bad for me and colleagues. There was no heating in a room, and the attitude of changing the room was not good. There was still no heating after the room was changed., The dragon head of the basin is very small, the shower area, the water is not smooth, the facilities are old, and the bathroom bath environment is very cold; the three breakfast is acceptable.It is hoped that Huangjia should renovate again, and the current room facilities and services will not meet the 4 -star standards and requirements."
1,一个干净，舒适的酒店，如果你不是一定要住在市中心的话，是一个不错的选择。早餐很丰盛，价格稍微高了点。一楼的川菜也是不错的。,"A clean, comfortable hotel, if you don't have to live in the city center, it is a good choice.Breakfast is rich and the price is slightly higher.Sichuan cuisine on the first floor is also good."
0,"我们四人到太原办事,2007-5-14入住时,两位男同事给了一间大床房,折腾半天才搞清楚.17日同事退房时,前台说房间少了一条睡裤,我真无法想象.我相信我的同事她连睡衣放在什么位置都不知道.嗨,争论半天饭店态度及差,我真的很是失望.请要入住该酒店的朋友们入住时一定要清点你房间的消费物品.","The four of us went to Taiyuan to do business. When they moved in 2007-5-14, the two male colleagues gave a large bed room and tossed for a long time to figure out. On the 17th, when the colleagues were checking out, the front desk said that the room was missing a pair of pajamas.I really can't imagine. I believe that my colleague does not even know where she puts pajamas. Hi, arguing with the restaurant's attitude and difference in the hotel for a long time, I am really disappointed. Please check in when you stay in the hotel.Consumer items in the room."
1,离沟口近，可以在窗口看到进沟的人流，房间还行，就是我要存包服务员不太愿意。,"When you are close to the mouth, you can see the flow of people entering the ditch in the window."

The moldy smell of the room is very heavy, and I have lived many times, and I ca n’t do it every time I enter; you have to quickly turn on the air conditioner and windows. 2. Breakfast is too bad; you can only eat fried eggs and Western rice every time you go."
1,在金府银街的背后，应该是由居民楼改建而成。上个月去住了次，本来订的是标准间，去的时候标准间没大床，给升成了豪华间，仔细一看就是个2居室。房间挺旧，但是很干净，一房里还有电脑可供上网。服务人员态度十分好，非常的客气。但是如果不跟他们提出要咖啡券和足浴赠券的话，是不给的。总的来说，作为一个商务型的酒店，除了旧点，网速慢点，还是可以接受的。,"Behind the Jinfuyin Street, it should be converted from the residential building.I went to live last month. I originally booked a standard room. When I went, the standard room did not have a big bed. It was promoted to a luxury room.The room is very old, but it is very clean. There are also computers in one room to access the Internet.The service staff attitude is very good and very polite.But if you don't ask them to ask for coffee coupons and foot bath, it will not be given.In general, as a business -oriented hotel, in addition to the old point, the network speed is slower, it is still acceptable."
1,行政房间太小。不过还算可以。所谓湖景房，实际上看不见湖的。离西湖起步价。也不算近。其余的还可以吧。,The administrative room is too small.But it's okay.The so -called lake view houses are actually invisible to the lake.Starting from West Lake.It's not close.The rest is okay.
0,这个鬼地方居然是三星简直让人无法相信差，太差了，可惜没0分，有0分一定打0分,"This ghost place is actually that Samsung is unable to believe it, it is too bad, but unfortunately there is no 0 points, and 0 points must be 0 points."
1,在潮州这样的城市还是不错的.整体性价比.早餐内容也比较丰富.,Cities like Chaozhou are still good. The overall cost performance. The content of breakfast is also rich.
1,酒店地理位置：4分，地理位置一般，离火车站文殊院较近，出租车相对比较好叫，大约等5分钟左右。酒店环境：5分，很有味道的芙蓉文化主题酒店，很有特色，个人很喜欢，就是作为4星级酒店来说服务态度稍微差了一点。,"Hotel geographical location: 4 points, average geographical location, closer to the Railway Station Manjushri Academy, and the taxi is relatively easy to call, about 5 minutes.Hotel environment: 5 points, very delicious Furong Culture -themed Hotel, very distinctive, personally like it, that is, as a 4 -star hotel, the service attitude is slightly worse."
1,"三人房和商务套房都不错,房间很大,适合一家人去住,厨房设备齐全,还有洗衣机.补充点评2007年12月21日：但房间设施和用品就非常一般,大概2星水平!!!","The three -person rooms and business suite are good. The rooms are very large.

0,"是我住过的所有旅馆里最差的一个.预订时说希望要无烟房,结果开了房门以后被烟味及各种体臭味搞得一夜未眠.旅馆可能根本没有无烟房,但携程竟然也没事先说一下算是失职.设施破旧,毛巾都是发黄的.床单及被套都旧旧的,搞不清有没有换洗.服务人员全是","It is the worst one in all the hotels I have lived.

1,旧楼(1)房间内设备较差，淋浴室的门坏了没修，以至浴室很湿,"The old building (1) The equipment in the room was poor, the door of the shower room was broken, and the bathroom was very wet."
1,4星级的酒店，环境不错，宽带免费上网速度挺快，早餐也挺丰盛的。报告在郑州4星级的酒店这个价格相对来说还是贵了一点,"The 4 -star hotel, the environment is good, the free Internet speed is fast, and the breakfast is very rich.The price of the report at the 4 -star hotel in Zhengzhou is relatively expensive"
0,说说这里的“五星级”服务吧：1、在前台check-in的时候要求对方提供尽可能高些的楼层（因为是海景房），结果小姐给了17楼的房间，并且很不屑地对我说：这已经是很高的楼层了！！――房间看到的是正在建造的裙楼的楼顶和陪衬的海景。哈哈哈2、登记完，前台小姐只给了一张放卡，我们是同事两人所以我让她给我做两张卡，小姐态度坚决地说：不可以！，我问她为什么，她说：“这是酒店的规定”---晕！天底下竟然有这样的酒店规定和这样素质的员工。当我再次态度坚决地要求时，她说了如下的一段话：“每张卡50元，丢了你要赔钱！！！！！”――就这样我最终拿到了两张房卡。我这辈子第一次领教了所谓星级酒店的如此服务和“规定”。3、退房的前一天，因为返航班机是在晚上八点的，所以我特意打电话给前台询问是否可以安排latecheck-out(晚些退房），电话的那头又给我上了一课：对方态度坚定、坚决、坚毅地说：不可以，过了12点我们要收你的房费！！4、退房时，我要求服务人员把我的信用卡预签帐金额及时取消，对方用一种专业老师对白痴学生的眼神看着我说：一个月后自动会取消的。我们不会多收“你们”钱。。。这就是我入住了四晚该酒店的客人得到的待遇！！对了，说说房间吧：1、没有用过的浴缸里有一撮头发！！！！2、淋浴了以后，整个外面的地面就全湿了，要等到第二天回房才会干（服务员打扫一次）3、半夜去用洗手间，却发现门自动从里面锁上了，仔细观察后发现这个门已经被撬过N次了，总算在服务员来了又走，工程部又来人以后，才把问题解决了。我真想给他们高些的分啊！！！我真的想。。。,"Talk about the ""five-star"" service here: 1.

1,"服务尚可,携程网协议价偏高.本人发现其他公司协议价只有366元(含早).","The service is acceptable, and the Ctrip.com agreement is high. I found that the price of other companies was only 366 yuan (including early)."
0,四星级的牌子他们还真敢挂！北京的酒店向来这样，又贵又差！房间里面那个叫热啊，开了空调制冷根本不起作用。打电话给客房服务，居然说只有自然风，没有冷风！哪是什么自然风啊，明显比室外的气温高得多。最后，他们给我的建议是把房间的窗户打开。北京那个鬼气候，外面正在飘杨树苗呢，能开么！早餐就不提了，就那么点东西，西式的难吃得要命，中餐也好不到哪里去。还有就是酒店的电话根本就是乱收费！房间里没有长途价目表，服务指南也只是几张复印的A4纸。结帐的时候，打出了清单，国内长途差不多8毛一分钟，移动的12593也不过0.39/分，黑店！下次打死也不住了！,"They really dare to hang up!Hotels in Beijing have always been like this, expensive and bad!The one in the room is called hot, and the air -conditioning refrigeration does not work at all.Calling the guest room service, actually said that there was only natural style, no cold wind!What is natural style, obviously much higher than the outdoor temperature.Finally, the suggestion they gave me was to open the window of the room.The ghost climate in Beijing, the poplar saplings outside, can you open it!Breakfast is not mentioned, just a little bit, the Western style is terrible, and the Chinese food is not much better.There is also the hotel phone call at all!There is no long -distance price watch in the room, and the service guide is just a few copies of A4 paper.At the time of checkout, the list was played. The domestic long distance was almost 8 cents, and the mobile 12593 was only 0.39/minute. Black shop!I can't help it next time!"
0,设施一般，大堂服务没有笑容，其它方面还可以。,"The facilities are average, the lobby service has no smile, and other aspects are okay."
1,这次定的是B区的标间，浴室比A区的标间多了浴缸，而且稍大，但房间设施虽然干净但毕竟只能够得上3星。好在早餐不错，可以加分，外加室外的环境真的不错，早起散步感觉很好。在安吉据说这里仍是最好的宾馆，看看每天那么多团体住客就能说明问题了。,"This time is the standard room of area B. The bathroom has more bathtubs than the standard room in the A area, and it is slightly larger, but although the room facilities are clean, they can only be 3 stars.Fortunately, breakfast is good, you can add points, and the outdoor environment is really good. It feels good to get up early.It is said that it is still the best hotel here in Anji. See so many group guests every day can explain the problem."
1,酒店还可以，好像和银行在一个楼。酒店热空调聚热，一开始不知道，开了很大，中间睡觉被热醒了，有点夸张。卫生间巨大，可以房间很小。屋内设施有些老,"The hotel is fine, it seems to be on the one -building with the bank.The hotel's hot air -conditioning accumulated heat. I didn't know it at first. It was very large. I was awakened by sleeping in the middle, which was a bit exaggerated.The bathroom is huge and the room can be small.There are some old facilities in the house"
1,房间很不错晚餐自助餐不咋地，倒是1楼的日式料理味道不错，价格也差不多，2楼中餐厅的菜色很新很好吃早餐就不谈了,"The room is very good for dinner buffet, but the Japanese cuisine on the first floor tastes good and the price is similar. The food on the second floor on the second floor is very new and delicious."
0,服务相当差，缺乏必要的职业素养，是遇到的最差的涉外三星。（不知如何评上的星的）。卫生情况比较担心：早餐室有苍蝇相伴，送到房内的卫生筷看上去脏脏的，而且包装破损，订餐处极为嘈杂，只听到地方话的大声喧哗按服务指南无法拨长途，打了几个电话后才了解还要到大堂登记。临走希望服务员帮助查询长途车站电话，竟无人乐意，都一推了之。还好唯一一位比较好的男服务员在看到我极为不满后帮助查询。,"The service is quite poor, and the lack of necessary professionalism is the worst foreign -related Samsung.(I don't know how to comment on the stars).The sanitary condition is more worried: the breakfast room has a fly accompanied by the flies. The sanitary chopsticks sent to the room look dirty, and the packaging is damaged. The ordering place is extremely noisy.After a few phone calls, I only need to register in the lobby.I hope that the waiter will help inquire about the long -distance station phone call. No one is willing to push it.Fortunately, the only better male waiter helped the inquiry after seeing me extremely dissatisfied."
0,因为近昆百所以住了这家五星，感觉最多是个三星。设备老化，环境也不好在闹市也没什么空间给住客如花园什么的。服务员态度也不热情，前台给人感觉业务不熟练，不太会礼貌用语。半夜还被蚊子叮醒了。总之住的不爽。还不如四星的锦江。,"I lived in this five -star because I was near Kunbai, and I felt at most Samsung.The equipment is aging, and the environment is not good. There is no room for guests to give guests like a garden or something.The waiter's attitude is not enthusiastic, and the front desk feels that the business is not proficient and not polite.Mosquito was woken up in the middle of the night.In short, I live uncomfortable.Not as good as the four -star Jinjiang."
1,酒店应该是唐山最好的酒店。二楼的餐厅服务很到位，赞一个。,"The hotel should be the best hotel in Tangshan.The restaurant on the second floor is in place, praise one."
1,前台服务态度很好很细心，但是硬件设施由于跟不上，老化。,"The front desk service attitude is very good and careful, but because the hardware facilities cannot keep up, they are aging."
0,“差“就一个字！以后再也不去这里了。价格还贵的离谱，感觉被坑了。,"""Poor"" is just one word!I will never go here again.The price is outrageous, and it feels pitted."
0,感觉一般，最便宜的房间没有窗户，房间太小。不过，里要去的办公地点很近--京东方,"It feels average. There is no window in the cheapest room, and the room is too small.However, the office you want to go is very close-BOE"
1,酒店的服务总的来说还是不错的，上网的速度也很快，下次还会住。只是携程的价格还是偏高，商务楼层598，我的客户可以订到同样的房间只要500元。,"The hotel's service is generally good, and the speed of the Internet is also very fast, and I will live next time.It is just that the price of Ctrip is still high. The business floor is 598. My customers can order the same room for only 500 yuan."
1,酒店很气派，周围环境很好，适合散步，交通也很方便,"The hotel is very elegant, the surrounding environment is very good, suitable for walking, and transportation is very convenient"
0,１、服务很差。我订的是视频网络大床房，入住时发现酒店里根本就没有电脑。直到退房时，酒店才告诉我，由于该房型已满，在没有通知的前提下，主动帮我换了一间房，是价格358的高级大床房。在我提出要将消费清单进行帐单合并时，服务人员竟然提出要收5元费用的要求。人不能无耻到这种地步吧！２、我住的房号是2727，房间过小，能看电视的空间只能摆下一张凳子。换句话说来个客人，只能坐在床上。３、硬件配备不足。没有放行李的行李架，没有晾衣服的晾绳。４、酒店出入打车不方便。酒店设在一个远离马路的拐角里，出租车出入要过一个卡站，非常不方便。且酒店门口空间较小，出租车只能停在离酒店五六米外停车。不方便。,"1. Poor service.I booked a large video online bedroom, and I found that there was no computer in the hotel at all.It wasn't until the check -in that the hotel told me that because the room type was full, I took the initiative to help me change a room with no notice, which is a high -end bed room with a price of 358.When I proposed to merge the bill of consumption list, the service staff even asked for a request to charge 5 yuan.People can't be shameless to this point!2. The number of room I live is 2727, and the room is too small. The space that can watch TV can only be placed with a stool.In other words, a guest can only sit on the bed.3. Insufficient hardware equipment.There are no luggage racks on luggage, and there is no drying rope for drying clothes.4. It is inconvenient to take a taxi in the hotel.The hotel is located in a corner of the road, and it is very inconvenient to pass a card station in and out of the taxi.And the room at the entrance of the hotel is small, and the taxi can only stop to park five or six meters away from the hotel.inconvenient."
1,房间不是很大，但是卫生间装的很有创意。早餐很好，品种多，而且味道不错，服务人员的态度也很好。,"The room is not very large, but the bathroom is very creative.Breakfast is good, there are many varieties, and the taste is good, and the attitude of the service staff is also very good."
1,"环境还算可以,但收费的网络居然还不行,速度不但慢,且收费高","The environment is okay, but the charging network is not good. The speed is not only slow, but also the fee is high."
1,开始订了富凯，虽然住在8楼双号，但是早上7点的时候就能听到下面的国歌声，早操音乐，实在太吵，第二晚就换到凯莱。我觉得房间很不错。床也很舒服。住在23楼很安静。除了不知道是不是新装修过的原因，走廊里有种难闻的气味，其他都好！而且12.31号当天入住的价格318比富凯还便宜20，房间要好上很多倍！（不过刚才看最便宜的房价已经398了，难道涨价了？）,"I started to order Fukai. Although I lived on the 8th floor, I could hear the national anthem below at 7 am. Morning music was too noisy. I changed to Kaile on the second night.I think the room is very good.The bed is also very comfortable.Living on the 23rd floor is very quiet.Except for the reason for the new decoration, there is a kind of unpleasant smell in the corridor, everything else!And the price at the 12.31 day on the same day is 318 cheaper than Fukai, and the room is many times better!(But the cheapest house price has been 398 just now, is the price increase?)"
0,我是3月6日入住的，当时查看了网友对其他酒店的评语，都不怎么样，选择这家是因为当时还没有任何评语。但结果是一样很差，根本不够四星，房间的衣柜里还有蟑螂，我当场拍死了一只。298元/晚绝对不值，和成都相比，价格相等，服务和设备相差太远，下次不会住那里了，如果可能，最好回成都住，绵阳-成都车程只有1小时45分钟。,"I stayed on March 6. At that time, I checked the netizens' comments on other hotels. I chose this because there was no comment at the time.But the result is very bad, it is not enough for four stars, there are cockroaches in the wardrobe of the room, and I died on the spot.298 yuan/night is definitely not worth it. Compared with Chengdu, the price is equal, and the service and equipment are too far. It will not live there next time. If possible, it is best to return to Chengdu to live. Mianyang-Chengdu has only 1 hour and 45 minutes."
1,因为离同学家近，这次就住了海逸。交通比较便利出门5分钟就能到码头，可以坐轮渡到湾仔，价格非常便宜；到了湾仔就可以东取铜锣湾，西扫中环，金钟了。离黄埔花园的巴士总站也就五分钟的路程，可以坐8A到尖沙嘴海港城。去机场也很方便，机场快线的九龙站有免费巴士，从早上6点半开始每10分钟一班。不过因为没有地铁直达所以晚上不能玩太晚，8A的末班车是23点。酒店的服务很好香港的酒店服务一直都不错，这次在酒店里游泳的时候身上划了小口子，没啥大碍，不过酒店还是很重视，第二天还专门问候。酒店环境总体不错，不过对客房有些问题酒店临海，下楼就可以到海边散步，还是比较舒服。而且坐落在黄埔花园里面，边上是海天阁豪宅（据说林青霞到香港的驻地），和凤凰卫视的总部。生活设施比较完善，还不像市区那样喧闹。客房就一般了，这次为了压缩成本，住的是园景房，推窗一望，果然园景的厉害，窗外除了对过的楼就没别的可看。而且卫生间的格局有点问题，对我来说特别别扭。房间里有些地方落灰的厉害，刚入住那天居然还发现一个枕头上有鞋印!@$%#另外，估计这家酒店对本地人来说算是中档的消费，每天是食客盈门，而且结婚的特别多，大堂里一直都很热闹。周一还碰上了个韩国的什么团队客，棒子比内地的旅客还喳喳，有点吃不消。,"Because I was close to my classmates, I lived in Haiyi this time.The transportation is relatively convenient to go out to the pier in 5 minutes. You can take the wheel to Wan Chai. The price is very cheap; you can take the Causeway Bay in the east, sweep the Central Ring in the west, and the golden bell.It is only five minutes away from the bus terminal of Huangpu Garden.It is also very convenient to go to the airport. There are free buses at the Kowloon Station of the Airport Express, every 10 minutes from 6:30 in the morning.However, because there is no subway, you can't play too late at night. The last bus of 8A is 23 points.The hotel's service in Hong Kong has always been good. This time, when I swim in the hotel, I scratched a small mouth. It was not a big deal, but the hotel still attached great importance to it.The hotel environment is generally good, but there are some problems with the guest rooms that the hotel is in the sea, and you can take a walk to the beach when you go downstairs. It is still more comfortable.Moreover, it is located in Huangpu Garden, on the side is the Haitian Pavilion mansion (it is said that Lin Qingxia's residence from Hong Kong) and the headquarters of Phoenix TV.The living facilities are relatively complete, not as noisy as the urban area.The rooms are average. In order to compress the cost, I lived in the garden view room. I pushed the window and looked at it. Sure enough, the garden scene was powerful.And the layout of the bathroom is a bit problematic, which is particularly awkward for me.Some places in the room were so ashamed. I found a shoe print on a pillow on the day of staying!@$%#In addition, it is estimated that this hotel is a mid -range consumption for the locals.There are so many, and the lobby has always been lively.On Monday, I also met any team guests in South Korea. The stick was more than the travelers in the Mainland."

1,7月25日到家人到泰山玩，通过携程订的华侨大厦的房间（说是搞活动，花280升级到360的房间，但是实际我们也不知道280和360的房间到底是怎样的）。对华侨大厦的评价和以前很很多网友的评价一样：服务很热情，但是设施太陈旧（在携程网上看酒店的反馈，说是有新装修的房间，但是订房的时候携程的工作人员不知道我们订的房间是否是新装修的，这点希望携程以后把工作做仔细一些）。入住华侨大厦从门童、前台带房间服务人都态度很好，很热情，对客人的要求反应很快（我因为带了孩子，要求多送一套洗漱用品到房间，刚放下电话没多久服务员就送来了），对一些我们询问的怎么去泰山玩，附近有什么好吃的等问题都很耐心的回答。房间有欢迎果盘，而且分量不小，很实在，呵呵。但是华侨大厦的设施确实太陈旧了，很多地方的墙纸已经脱落，房间的浴室比较小，而且没有独立的淋浴间，感觉老人和小孩使用时比较不方便。但是良好的服务还是可以弥补这些不足的，而且价钱也不贵，感觉还可以接受。,"On July 25, I went to my family to play in Taishan. The room of the Overseas Chinese Building ordered by Ctrip (saying that it was engaged in activities, it took 280 to upgrade to 360 rooms, but in fact we don't know what the 280 and 360 rooms are).The evaluation of the Overseas Chinese Building is the same as that of many netizens in the past: the service is very enthusiastic, but the facilities are too old (the feedback from the hotel on the Ctrip.com, saying that there is a newly renovated room, but the staff of Ctrip during the booking did not know us.Whether the booking room is newly renovated, I hope that Ctrip will take the job carefully in the future).Check in the Qianshu Building from the door children and the front desk with the room service. They are very enthusiastic and very enthusiastic. The response to the guests is very fast.It was sent), and how we asked how we went to Taishan to play, and any delicious questions nearby were answered patiently.There is a welcome fruit plate in the room, and the weight is not small, very real, huh.However, the facilities of the Overseas Chinese Building are indeed too old. The wallpaper in many places has fallen off. The bathroom in the room is relatively small, and there are no independent shower rooms. It feels inconvenient when the elderly and children are used.But good services can still make up for these shortcomings, and the price is not expensive, and it feels acceptable."
1,客房空间比较宽阔，服务人员态度也算可以，有件事就算提醒吧，小心假币。没有证据就不多说了。,"The room space is relatively wide, and the attitude of the service staff is okay. If you have something, you should be reminded, be careful of fake coins.There is no more evidence."
1,山项游泳池的清泉碧水印象深刻。餐厅不错，从外面玩一天回来晚上九点半还有吃的，最稀饭萝卜干炒鸡蛋，味道好而且价格公道，卡卡~从此爱上闽西。。,"The clear spring and clear water of the mountain swimming pool was impressed.The restaurant is good. From the outside, I will eat it at 9:30 in the evening. The most porridge radish is dry and fried eggs. The taste is good and the price is fair.Essence"
0,"第一次给这么差的评价,一定要说明一下理由的:1.房间我们住在B区1006号房.空调根本没有作用.电热毯要加温3小时以上才有温度.2.洗澡绝对不是24小时热水,甚至不是24小时有水.我们一团友晚上洗澡洗到一半什么水都没有了.只好用毛巾把身上的肥皂擦掉.3.安全.我们的房间是没有双保险的.最夸张的是,由于太冷,我让服务员加一条被子,结果该服务员连门都不敲就进来,把被子放在我床上.我那个时候真是无比惊恐啊,4.餐饮:只有一个饭店,什么叫垄断经营到这里就知道了.5.交通:上山后到某一个区域开始就变成单车道了.所以如果遇到会车,其后果不堪设想.我们就在上山途中遇到一次,双方还发生口角和肉体的搏斗.6.娱乐:冬季只有滑雪类项目,收费超级贵.绝对比上海的银七星要贵很多.根本不值.7.服务:我只能说在这里根本没有服务这一项的说.","For the first time to evaluate such a bad evaluation, we must explain the reason: 1. The room we live in Room 100 Zone B. The air conditioner has no effect at all. The electric blanket should be heated for more than 3 hours to have temperature. 2. Bathing is definitely not a bath.24 hours of hot water, not even 24 hours of water. A group of friends have gone to half of the water at night. We have to wipe off the soap on our body with a towel. 3. Safe. Our room has no double insurance.The most exaggerated is that because it was too cold, I asked the waiter to add a quilt. As a result, the waiter came in without even knocking on the door, and put the quilt on my bed. I was really amazing at that time.What is a monopoly operation here? 5. Transportation: After going up the mountain, starting to a certain area will become a bicycle lane. So if you encounter a car, the consequences are unimaginable. We will encounter it once on the way up the mountain.The struggle between the corners and the flesh .6. Entertainment: There is only skiing projects in winter, and the charges are super expensive. It is definitely much more expensive than the silver seven stars in Shanghai. It is not worth it .7. Service: I can only say that there is no service here at all. There is no service here.Said."
1,"一家三口上周去了佘山度周末,森林宾馆环境不错,倚竹而居,恬静幽雅,但也有美中之不足,女儿退房前把手机遗忘在客房沙发靠垫下,回到上海才想起来,几番电话联系,都说没找到,但最后得知手机竟在酒店的垃圾桶里被发现,失而复得不甚喜悦。酒店善后服务也算不错,可手机如何长了腿自己跑到了垃圾桶内倒是蛮值得耐人寻味一番啊!","The family of three went to Laoshan to weekends last week. The forest hotel has a good environment, lives on bamboo, quiet and elegant, but there is also a lack of beauty.

1,我是看了点评才入住海景嘉福的，感觉还不如怡东。服务并不好。房间内通风不好有异味。也没看到有送水果和巧克力。总体感觉跟四星差不多。,"I saw the review before staying in the sea view Jiafu, and I felt worse than Yidong.The service is not good.The ventilation in the room is not good.I didn't see fruit and chocolate.Overall feels similar to the four stars."
1,晚上11点多才入住。5号楼离前台真是远，拿着行李自己走过去的。刚进房间1分钟，小姐电话就来了。可谓神速！早上check-out，发现酒店环境不错。还有游泳池。但是早饭和4星级不符。,"Stay at more than 11 pm.Building 5 is really far from the front desk, walking with his luggage by himself.As soon as I entered the room for 1 minute, the lady came.It can be described as fast!In the morning check-out, I found that the hotel environment was good.There is also a swimming pool.But breakfast does not match 4 stars."
0,"大堂和电梯厅的装修还是比较有特色的,但客房却相当一般.需要提出的是,不知是否因为是携程预订,安排了楼层最角落的房间,这还不说,门旁边就是设备房,从我下午两点多入住准备休息开始,一直到吃晚餐之前,楼道里就没有安静超过二十分钟!此间,本人曾不下三次出门,对发出异响的客房工作人员提出""抗议"",基本作用不大,依然我行我素,喧闹依旧.实在无奈,只好打电话进行投诉(可查找当日的电话记录).因为几天前曾入住过上海的另一家同类型酒店,差异对比太明显,所以基本不会考虑下次的入住.另外从中环线到达该酒店,需要绕好大一个圈才能到达,不大方便(尤其是自己打的).最后,希望这家酒店以后要""善待""携程的用户，什么拐角，尽头的房间还是少安排得好，建议尽量安排给附近比较多的日本友人的干活！！！","The decoration of the lobby and the elevator hall is still more distinctive, but the guest room is quite average.

1,硬件还可以，软件需跟上。交通方便，娱乐设施全,"Hardware is okay, software needs to keep up.Convenient transportation and full entertainment facilities"
1,"酒店硬件和软件设施都不错,服务也很专业,去香港会经常住这家酒店.","The hotel's hardware and software facilities are good, and the service is very professional. When you go to Hong Kong, you will often live in this hotel."
1,1.房间：就是冲着280元的三人间才定的，感觉性价比较高；房间采用复合地板，可惜没有冰箱；是中央空调（稍微有点吵）；床单家具倒也干净；感觉差的是洗澡水好小啊，总觉得洗不干净；而且有好几次只有热水没有冷水，洗手都觉得烫。2.环境：和普通的三星酒店差不多，因为开业时间太久了，所以感觉比较旧，但还算干净；三人间靠近马路，有点吵，不过关上窗户后就不太觉得了。3.服务：只有在入住和离店的时候才和前台接触过，感觉他们不太像接待员，没有亲和力，只能算是有问必答而已，房间服务员也只是接触过一次，态度倒还好，可惜住了三天没有换过一次床品。4.交通：离火车站很近，打车8元即到（起步费5元）。酒店附近有很多路公交车，可到墟沟（去连岛在此转车）的专线车，也有到火车站的，还有到花果山去的公交车，很方便；打车起步价就可以到陇海路步行街（不过个人认为没什么好玩的）；走路十分钟有个苍梧绿园的公园，可以吃过饭去溜达溜达。5.餐饮：赠送的自助早餐很丰盛，味道还算不错，吃得很饱，而且小孩子（四岁，1.1米）也不另外收费。另外二楼的餐厅包间环境也不错，吃了两次晚餐，他们的川菜味道很好，分量很足，而且价格便宜，一大盆鱼头豆腐汤（好多鱼头）才15元，而且味道很鲜美，推荐。海鲜就一般了，价格和外面的差不多。总结：如果在市区（新浦区）办事的话，住这里挺方便的，如果不是太挑剔的话，其实各方面倒也可以，尤其三人间的价格很核算。但如果去旅游的话，还是到墟沟找酒店住比较方便，因为景点离那里近，而且那里也很热闹，有很多餐馆。,"1. Room: It is only settled in the three -person room of 280 yuan. It feels cost -effective; the room uses a composite floor, but there is no refrigerator; it is a central air conditioner (a little noisy);The water is so small, I always feel that the washing is not clean; and there are several times that only hot water does not have cold water, and I feel hot.2. Environment: It is almost the same as ordinary Samsung Hotel. Because it has been opened for too long, it feels older, but it is clean; the three are close to the road and are a bit noisy, but it doesn't feel much after closing the window.3. Services: Only when you stay in and leave the store, you have been in contact with the front desk. I feel that they are not like receptionists. They have no affinity. They can only be regarded as questioning. The room waiter has only been in contact with it once.Unfortunately, I haven't changed the beds for three days.4. Transportation: It is close to the train station, and the taxi is 8 yuan to get (5 yuan starting fee).There are many bus buses near the hotel. You can go to the market cars that can go to the market (to the island to transfer to the car), and there are also on the train station, as well as the bus from Huaguo Mountain, which is very convenient; the starting price of a taxi can arriveLonghai Road Pedestrian Street (but I personally think that there is nothing fun); there is a park in Cangwu Green Park for ten minutes, you can eat meals to walk.5. Catering: The bunch of buffets presented is very rich, the taste is pretty good, and they are full, and children (four years old, 1.1 meters) are not charged.In addition, the restaurant in the restaurant on the second floor is also good. After two dinner, their Sichuan cuisine tastes good, the weight is sufficient, and the price is cheap. A large pot of fish head tofu soup (many fish head) is only 15 yuan, and the taste is very goodFresh, recommended.Seafood is average, the price is similar to the outside.Summary: If you work in the urban area (Xinpu District), it is convenient to live here. If it is not too picky, in fact, it is also possible in all aspects, especially the price of the three in the world is well calculated.However, if you go to travel, it is more convenient to go to the market to find a hotel, because the attractions are close to there, and there are also lively there, there are many restaurants."

0,隔音效果太差，窗外空调机闹得一晚上没睡着觉，第二天就退店，换地方住了。,The sound insulation effect was too bad. The air -conditioning machine outside the window had to fall asleep all night. I went to the next day to rest and live in a place.
0,真的很差，就这个价格来说完全可以在桂林住到更好的酒店，前台服务员态度一般，入住之后，空调有问题，房间卫生间没有完全隔开，不方便！反正很不满意，建议不要入住,"It's really bad. In this price, you can live in a better hotel in Guilin. The attitude of the front desk waiter is average. After check -in, there is a problem with the air conditioner. The room toilet is not completely separated, which is not convenient!I am very dissatisfied anyway, it is recommended not to stay in"
0,优点：交通便利缺点：不符合我心中的四星1.酒店的泳池还不如比它小的酒店漂亮。2.在三亚湾又不是亚龙湾，这个价位没有优势，得不到相应的要求。3.与之前的评价不符，a距离春圆海鲜广场没那么近．b楼下的金凤凰广场也没有想的那么好．总之：下回不会在选择了，还不如花少钱住三亚湾的小型度假村或花同样的钱住环境好的亚龙湾,"Advantages: Traffic convenience disadvantages: Four stars in my heart 1. The pool of hotels is not as beautiful as hotels smaller than it.2. In Sanya Bay, it is not Yalong Bay. There is no advantage in this price and no corresponding requirements.3. It doesn't match the previous evaluation, A is not so close to the spring of spring seafood square.The Golden Phoenix Square downstairs was not as good as it was.In short: I will not choose the next time. It is better to spend less money to live in Sanya Bay's small resort or spend the same money to live in the Yallong Bay with a good environment."
1,非常不错的酒店，环境很好，空气也很清新。我一起入住的同事还建议我们公司的年会就到这里来开，呵呵,"Very good hotel, the environment is very good, and the air is very fresh.My colleagues who stayed together also suggested that our company’s annual meeting will come here, haha"
1,好。。。。。。。方便，但所订房间不含早，服务也还好，落在房间的两个充电器也找回，整体感觉：还好。,"good.EssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceIt is convenient, but the booked room is not early, and the service is okay. The two chargers falling in the room also retrieved. The overall feeling: Fortunately."

1,我下午5点多去的，告诉我原来订的豪华房已经没有的，说携程只让保留到5点钟。还好，他们房间多，就给升级到其他楼的套间了。因为原来是疗养院改建的宾馆，环境还可以，不过房间的设计就保留着疗养院的风格了，水泥走廊也不铺地毯；房间的门可以看到下面的缝隙，所以隔音效果是没有的。房间里的设施也算不错，该有的都有了，但问题我住的套房只有沙发，没有写字台，看电脑比较费劲，上网要装个猫才行。毛巾太旧了，浴缸是个按摩式的-缺点是按摩功能用不了，洗淋浴还很不便当。有趣的是卫生间里居然好有个小洗衣机-不过对我们出差只呆一天的人来说，也是个摆设。设施和价格比，也算凑合吧，因为现在青岛的酒店都巨贵。这里的优势就象大家评论的，服务--或者说服务态度确实很好！有机会还会来住的，只不过以后要住豪华房试试。,"I went at 5 o'clock in the afternoon and told me that I had no luxury room I had ordered.Fortunately, their rooms have a lot of rooms, and they are upgraded to other buildings.Because it was originally a hotel reconstruction, the environment is okay, but the design of the room retains the style of the nursing home, and the cement corridor does not laid a carpet; the door of the room can see the gap below, so the sound insulation effect is not available.The facilities in the room are also good. There are all all, but the problem I live in the suite. The only suite I live is a sofa. I do n’t have an office desk. It is more laborious to see the computer. You need to install a cat on the Internet.The towel is too old, the bathtub is a massage-disadvantage is that the massage function cannot be used, and the shower is still inconvenient.What is interesting is that there is a small washing machine in the bathroom-but it is also a decoration for those who only spend a day on a business trip.Facilities and price ratios are also considered, because the hotels in Qingdao are now huge.The advantages here are like everyone commented, service-or service attitude is really good!If you have a chance, you will come to live, but you will try to live in a luxury room in the future."
0,这个３星实在太差了，住的房间开始么空调很低，简直没有，到后来么就拉倒空调坏了，住的房间都是一股霉味，床上面也都是发霉的，千万不要住这个酒店，我是一晚上没睡着，太差了．早餐简直就是没东西吃的，简直是一塌糊涂．服务元态度还算可以．,"This 3 -star is too bad. The air conditioner at the beginning of the room is very low. It is simply not. Later, the air conditioner was pulled down.I stayed in this hotel, I didn't fall asleep all night, it was too bad.Breakfast is simply nothing to eat, it is a mess.The attitude of service element is okay."

1,上次出差住了，主动免费升级了家庭套房，很不错，就是电脑太慢，系统也很老，不好使，有室外游泳池，不错的，出脚也方便，走几分钟路程就到狮子桥美食街，地铁站也很方便！就是房价太贵，三楼的餐厅也不错，价格也蛮贵的。,"Last time, I took the initiative to upgrade the family suite for free. It is very good, that is, the computer is too slow, the system is very old, it is not easy to use, there are outdoor swimming pools, good, and convenient to take a few minutes.Food Street, subway station is also very convenient!That is, house prices are too expensive, restaurants on the third floor are also good, and the price is quite expensive."
1,酒店很新，房间很干净，有免费宽带，还有一个大约长20米的小游泳池。虽然服务差点儿，可这是北京的通病，也没特别差到哪儿去。认为性价比高，比许多老式的北京的三星级酒店好许多。因为酒店在巷子里，第一次找的时候费了点儿劲，熟悉了就好找了。周围大小饭馆林立，用餐很方便。周末的时候四周走走，离孔庙、雍和宫近在咫尺，或者在胡同里散步，很有老北京的风味。而且打车去美术馆、王府井也就10多元，很方便。不过出门打车要走到巷子口，好在北京下雨少，也不见得很麻烦。,"The hotel is new, the room is very clean, there are free broadband, and there is a small swimming pool about 20 meters long.Although the service is almost a bit, this is a common problem in Beijing, and it is not particularly worse.It is believed that the price / performance ratio is much better than many old -fashioned Beijing -level hotels.Because the hotel is in the alley, it takes a little bit when I look for it for the first time.The surrounding restaurants are standing, and the meal is very convenient.Walk around the weekend, close to the Confucian Temple, the Palace of the Yonghe Palace, or walk in the hutong.And it is more than 10 yuan to take a taxi and Wangfujing, which is very convenient.However, you have to go to the alley to take a taxi. Fortunately, it may not be troublesome to rain in Beijing."
1,"酒店的西餐很不,特是晚上的自助餐,烤肉非常有特色.","The Western food in the hotel is not very different, especially the buffet at night, barbecue is very distinctive."
1,在本地肯定是不错的酒店了，去淮南的话值得一住。,"It is definitely a good hotel in the local area. If you go to Huainan, it is worth living."
0,一般的不能在一般的酒店。也就算得上3星吧，房间不大临街有点吵。房价根本就没有竞争力，旁边的新世界才238比这好的多。酒店前台办理入住速度很慢。下午在酒店休息服务员敲门打扫房间跟她说不用还执意要进来换毛巾太执着了也。唯一算不错的是酒店地址是商业区（高峰时候打车很困难），下次不会入住。而且携程给的房间价没有一点竞争力。,"Generally cannot be in ordinary hotels.Even if you get 3 stars, the room is a bit noisy when the room is not large.House prices are not competitive at all. The new world next to it is only 238 better than this.The hotel's front desk office is very slow.In the afternoon, the restaurant at the hotel knocked on the door and cleaned the room and told her that she didn't need to insist on coming in to change the towel.The only good thing is that the hotel address is the commercial area (it is difficult to take a taxi at the peak), and will not stay next time.And the room price given by Ctrip is not competitive."
1,环境不错，出了后门就是洋人街，整个酒店风格独特，挺舒服的，但遗憾的是好像上不了网。,"The environment is good. Out of the back door is Foreign Street. The entire hotel has a unique style and comfortable, but unfortunately it seems that it can't be on the net."
1,沙发套比较脏啊```不过卧室很干净```总体来说不错啦```,"The sofa jacket is dirty, but the bedroom is very clean `` `Overall it is good` `` `"
0,该酒店最大的缺点就是：吵闹！对面的大喇叭白天一直在放，里面又有餐厅在吵！白天几乎没发休息！,"The biggest disadvantage of the hotel is: noisy!The big horn on the opposite side has been putting in the daytime, and there are restaurants in it!There is almost no rest during the day!"
0,看了携程的其他用户评价不错就选择了这家酒店。挺失望的前台的小姐出奇的慢说话也很生硬。更郁闷的是我们住的368一晚的房间房间小浴室和卫生间在一起都是玻璃透明的即使拉下卷帘也有一面是无法遮挡的所以上洗手间觉得十分尴尬。,"After watching other users of Ctrip, I chose this hotel.The disappointed front desk lady was surprisingly slow.What is even more depressed is that the room room and bathroom we lived in the 368 -night room and the bathroom were transparent. Even if the rolling curtain was pulled down, there was an unstoppable side, so it was very embarrassing to go to the bathroom."

0,非常失望，定了一周第二天就换了酒店，是个康体中心，房间设施最多也就是个2星的标准，却要498。真是奇怪，携程还有这样的酒店。晚上9点到酒店，黑乎乎的一片，以为是出租车把我送错了地方。,"It was very disappointed. After the next day, I changed the hotel. It was the center of Kang Sports. The room facilities at most were the standard of 2 stars, but it took 498.It's strange that Ctrip has such a hotel.I arrived at the hotel at 9 pm, and I thought it was a taxi who sent me the wrong place."
1,在井冈山长青宾馆住了一晚，感觉很好：1.环境幽静，特别适于旅途休息；2.停车场很宽敞，适合自驾者停车；3.房间蛮大而且干净；4.最值得夸奖的是餐厅的服务特别好，态度亲切，环境清洁菜式可口，不像传说中的江西菜很咸，而是清淡入味。美中不足有：1.入住时正好是工作人员用餐时间，前台居然没有值班人员，还是保安帮助请来前台才办理了手续；2.信用卡不能使用；P.S.酒店在井冈山宾馆边、天街入口对面的一条小路上，自驾的朋友可是要仔细找哦。补充点评2008年4月13日：补充一下：宾馆开夜床时给每个床头各放了一只玫瑰，真是不小的惊喜。女儿因此欣喜若狂，下次如果来，还住这里。,"I stayed at the Changqing Hotel in Jinggang Mountain for one night, and it felt very good: 1. The environment was quiet, especially suitable for travel rest; 2. The parking lot was spacious and suitable for self -driving parking; 3.The restaurant's service is particularly good, with a kind attitude, and the environment is delicious. It is not as salty as the legendary Jiangxi cuisine, but it is light.The disadvantages of the United States and China are: 1. At the time of check -in, the staff meal time, there is no duty personnel at the front desk, or the security help helps the front desk to go through the procedures; 2. The credit card cannot be used; P.S.On the road, self -driving friends have to find it carefully.Supplementary comment on April 13, 2008: Added: When the hotel opened the night bed, a rose was placed on each bedside. It was really a lot of surprises.The daughter was ecstatic, and if I came next time, I still live here."

0,"我是5月初在携程上预定该酒店1间标间加床的，预定价格为320＋100。5月13日早上入住时被告知无房间，要等中午才有房间，我询问是标间还是三人间时，小姐很不耐烦地表示会为我们优先准备三人间。中午回到酒店，前台小姐说标间还没有打扫完，所以推荐我们改为三人间，当我询问价格时，小姐先是模糊地说跟标间加床后的价格差不多，后来又笼统地说四百多，最后在我一直要求下才很不耐烦地查看了下电脑后报价420,于是入住。14日的自助早饭比较丰盛，服务员的态度也比较好，但是到15日却大不一样了，稀饭是冷的，豆浆没有了却不见有服务员添加，品种也少了许多，服务员聚在一起开心地聊天，根本不去理会客人有什么需要。（15日离店时在酒店门口赫然发现“庆祝南平市首届科技成果交易会5月13日胜利召开”，于是恍然大悟。）15日上午结帐，刷卡时突然发现金额是每天470元，于是询问前台，被告知三人间就是这个价格，在我一再坚持下，前台打电话给13日早上当班的服务员，没想到那位小姐居然改口说13日入住时给我们的价格就是四百多。我当时就说这并不是钱多少的问题，而是商家诚信的问题。不知道各位看客是什么感觉，但是就我个人来说，是再也不会去武夷山了，即使去了，我再也不会住在这样一个没有基本诚信的酒店，忍受每天晚上小姐的准时骚扰了。","I booked a bed in the hotel in the hotel in early May. The scheduled price was 320 + 100. When I was in the morning on May 13th, I was informed that there was no room. I had to wait at noon.At that time, the lady was impatiently stated that she would prefer the three rooms for us.Back to the hotel at noon, the lady at the front desk said that the standard room has not been cleaned, so it is recommended that we change to a three -person room. When I asked the price, the lady first said vaguely that it was similar to the price after the bed was added.It was more than a hundred, and finally I kept asking for the quotation of 420 after the computer was impatient, so I checked in.The self -service breakfast on the 14th is more abundant, and the attitude of the waiter is also better, but the 15th is very different. The porridge is cold. There is no waiter to add soy milk.Chatting on the ground, do not ignore the needs of the guests at all.(When leaving the store on the 15th, he found ""Celebrating the victory of the first science and technology achievement trade in Nanping on May 13th"", so he suddenly realized.) On the morning of the 15th, the amount suddenly found that the amount was 470 yuan per day, so asked about the question, so asked about it, so asked about it, so asked about it, so I askedAt the front desk, the three -person room was the price. Under I repeatedly insisted on, the front desk called the waiter who worked as a class on the morning of the 13th. I did not expect that the lady actually changed the price to be more than 400 when the price gave us on the 13th.I said that this was not a matter of money, but the problem of merchant integrity.I don't know what you feel, but as far as I personally, I will never go to Wuyi Mountain anymore. Even if I go, I will never live in such a hotel without basic integrity and endure the time harassment of the lady every night.It's right."
0,房间破旧，电视无法正常观看，卫生间连厕纸都不给准备，还要自备。空调没有遥控器，就是个摆设，晚上要穿衣服睡觉。服务质量很差！,"The room is dilapidated, the TV cannot be watched normally, and the bathroom is not prepared to the toilet paper, and it must be prepared.The air conditioner does not have a remote control, it is a furnishings, and you have to wear clothes to sleep at night.The quality of service is poor!"

0,酒店位置比较偏远，按照地址打车去被送到另外一个相同地址的地方，希望酒店引起注意。房间格调很前卫。也许年轻人还可以接受。,The location of the hotel is relatively remote. Take a taxi according to the address to be delivered to another place with the same address. I hope the hotel will attract attention.The style of the room is avant -garde.Maybe young people can accept it.
1,酒店位于别墅区内，适合全家人度假。南楼距离主楼比较远，有时感觉不太方便。酒店南楼的SPA环境非常好，推荐。,"The hotel is located in the villa area and is suitable for the whole family for vacation.The south building is far from the main building, and sometimes it feels not convenient.The SPA environment in the South Tower of the hotel is very good, recommended."
1,这个酒店让我的总体感觉非常一般，甚至是很差。当天入住的时候，由于北京下雪晚点两个小时，我当时在机场给酒店打电话，告知晚点，要求保留预定房间。但没想到在前台做登记的时候，居然说由于临时来了客人，目前只有两个房间，其余的两个房间要降档次。由于已经晚上快11点了，无奈只好先行入住了。但以我这些年住酒店的经验来说，一是这种情况很少见，二是如果发生这种情况的话一般会给客人免费升级到更高档次的房间，而不是降档次。在住店过程中的种种不快就要淡忘的时候，没想到回到北京后，看到携程很负责的一个短信撤底让我对这个酒店失望透顶，在中途换房间的情况湘泉酒店居然算作我退房信息处理，少算了我2000多的积分，而携程短信确认我是否退房（我是10号入住，11号换房，湘泉把其中的一间算作11日已退房处理）。在这件事情上，我要特别赞赞咱们携程网，我把情况反映后，携程的客服人员特意又两次致电我了解有关情况，就评这个态度我也非常满意了。发完牢骚，大概说说酒店的房间。休闲大床间的床是紧靠着房门的；而高级大床间的房间格局很小，让人感觉很压抑。酒店的早餐不像四星的早餐。,"This hotel makes my overall feel very ordinary, even very bad.When I stayed on the same day, due to the two hours late in Beijing's snow, I called the hotel at the airport at the time to inform the late room and asked to keep the scheduled room.However, when I registered on the front desk, I said that because of the temporary guests, there are only two rooms, and the rest of the two rooms must be reduced.Since it was almost 11 o'clock in the evening, I had no choice but to stay in first.However, in terms of my experience in living in the hotel in recent years, this is rare, and the other is that if this happens, it will generally give guests to a higher -grade room for free, rather than lowering the grade.When the unhappiness in the shop is about to forget, I did not expect that after returning to Beijing, I saw a text message that Ctrip was responsible for making me disappointed this hotel.My check -out information processing has less than 2,000 points, and Ctrip SMS confirms whether I check out (I am on the 10th, change the room on the 11th, Xiangquan calculates one of them as a check -out on the 11thTo.In this matter, I would like to like our Ctrip.com. After I reflect the situation, Ctrip's customer service staff specially called me twice again to understand the relevant situation, and I was very satisfied with this attitude.After the complaint, talk about the hotel's room.The bed at the casual bed is close to the door; the room structure of the high -end bed is very small, which makes people feel very depressed.The hotel's breakfast is not like four -star breakfast."
0,房间还算干净，但房间内空气不好，有股空调里散发出的霉味；设施极其一般，淋浴龙头拧了半天也不知道倒底哪个是冷水，哪个是热水，到最后差点都关不掉了，估计冷热水龙头大概是装反掉了的；餐厅服务很一般，早餐质量极其一般，餐厅像大单位里的食堂。,"The room is quite clean, but the air in the room is not good, and there is a moldy smell in the air conditioner; the facilities are extremely general, and the shower faucet is twisted for a long time. I don’t know which one is cold water.No, it is estimated that the hot and cold water faucet is probably reversed; the restaurant service is very average, the quality of breakfast is extremely average, and the restaurant is like a cafeteria in a large unit."
0,在一个小胡同里，一般的出租车司机是找不到的。大堂非常有特色，以为进了一个室内的主题会展)，不论不类的欧式装饰。房间虽然不大(大床房)，尚能接受。最有意思的房间里林林总总的售品，就像进了一家小超市，饮料，方便面，桶装水，茶叶，零食，扑克牌统统收费，走进卫生间更像进了成人用品店，内裤，安全套，壮阳剂，居然还有女用DIY的用具一应俱全，晕！淋浴房太小，建议身高超过1.85米，体重180斤以上者务必小心，洗澡时动作幅度不要过大，免得碰到四周的墙/玻璃或房顶！还有就是房间的隔音条件实在太差，隔壁人上洗手间、刷牙的声音声声入耳，建议High起来动静比较大的兄弟姐妹千万不要入住，不然估计整个酒店都能分享到你的快乐呢！不过也有好的地方：一是免费宽带，网速较快；二是洗澡水比较大；三是门童热情，在北京属于少见。,"In a small alley, the average taxi driver cannot be found.The lobby is very distinctive, thinking that he has entered an indoor theme exhibition), regardless of European -style decoration.Although the room is not large (large bed room), it can be accepted.The most interesting room in the room is like entering a small supermarket, drinks, instant noodles, barrels of water, tea, snacks, poker cards, all charges. Entering the bathroom is more like adult products, underwear, condoms, condoms, condoms, condoms, condoms, condoms, condoms.Aphrodisiac, there are actually women's DIY appliances, dizzy!The shower room is too small. It is recommended to be more than 1.85 meters tall, and those who weigh more than 180 pounds must be careful. Do not have too much action during bathing, so as not to encounter the surrounding walls/glass or roof!There is also the sound insulation condition of the room is too bad. The sound of the sound of the people next door to the toilet and brushing teeth. It is recommended that the brothers and sisters with a relatively large movement should not stay, otherwise it is estimated that the entire hotel can share your happiness!However, there are also good places: first, free broadband, fast internet speed; second, bathing water is relatively large; third, the enthusiasm of the door children is rare in Beijing."
1,第一次住金海棠，完全没有想到在市区里会有这样花园式的酒店，处处绿萌盈盈。5号楼在最里面，应该是房间最好的。非常安静，房间窗外就是山林，空气很清新。进屋时发现窗子已经打开通风，所以屋内的空气是一般酒店里难得的清新。地理位置离乐山在佛也不远。不足之处是没有健身房。除此以外，金海棠都很好，强烈推荐！,"For the first time, I lived in Jin Haitang, and I did not expect that there would be such a garden -style hotel in the urban area, and it was green everywhere.Building 5 is in the innermost, it should be the best room.Very quiet, there is a mountain forest outside the room window, the air is very fresh.When entering the house, the window was found to be open, so the air in the house was rare and fresh in ordinary hotels.The geographical location is not far from Leshan in the Buddha.There is no gym.In addition, Jin Haitang is very good, highly recommended!"
1,装修不错，服务不错，价格有一点点高！！如果价格能少一点，我想会更多的人入住,"Good decoration, good service, a little price!IntersectionIf the price can be less, I think more people will stay in"
1,1、服务不错，安静。2、不足是设备旧了点。,1. Good service and quiet.2. Insufficient is the equipment of the equipment.
1,总的来说还可以，就是早餐的质量和种类太一般。,"In general, the quality and type of breakfast are too average."
0,有人已经作了很详尽的评述，在此不再重复了。住过两次，第一次住了一晚，半夜到的，第二天一早离开，只觉其豪华。第二次住了两晚，有时间体会，觉得这个酒店正如很多四川人说的“马粪蛋皮面光”。电梯、过道都有点阴森，卫生间大而无用。唯一值得称赞的是其早餐，过于丰富了。住这个酒店可得穿的光鲜点，不然的话，门童、前台都会怀疑你的付账能力的！,"Some people have made a detailed comment, and no longer repeat.I lived twice, I lived one night for the first time, arrived in the middle of the night, and left the next morning, I only felt luxurious.I stayed for two nights for the second time, and I had time to experience it. I felt that the hotel was said to many Sichuan people as ""horses and egg skin noodles"".The elevators and aisles are a bit gloomy, and the bathroom is large and useless.The only praise is the breakfast, which is too rich.You can wear the glorious point where you live in this hotel."
1,"1.酒店环境及大堂设计很气派2.服务态度还需改进,不能只是表面上应付客人。答应给我换大床房，只是敷衍了事，并没有给任何反馈意见。（前台入住接待人员）3.房间门稍旧，装修有点简单，但其他硬件设施很好。","1. The hotel environment and lobby design are very gas. 2. The service attitude needs to be improved.Promise to change the big bed room, but it was perfunctory and did not give any feedback.(At the front desk, the reception staff) 3. The room door is slightly old and the decoration is a bit simple, but other hardware facilities are very good."
1,"地理位置很好,房间不错,早餐丰富,总体很满意.下次还会去住.","The geographical location is very good, the room is good, the breakfast is rich, and the overall is very satisfied. I will live next time."
1,"在香港是性价比很高的酒店.房间较宽敞,我入住的是普通房,也能够看到海景.而且走过去直通车站十分方便,3分钟.","In Hong Kong, it is a very cost -effective hotel. The room is relatively spacious. I stay in ordinary rooms and can also see the sea view. And it is very convenient to walk through the station directly, 3 minutes."
1,每次都住套房，价格好象很便宜了．不过还是很划算的，反正也是公务，没时间好好去感受酒店的服务了．,"Every time I live in a suit, the price seems to be cheap.However, it is still very cost -effective, anyway, it is also a business, I have no time to feel the hotel's service."
0,房间小得不像话，早餐差得不像话，绝对不会再光顾。隔壁的南国大酒店看上去不错。晚上想在酒店的餐厅吃饭，结果人家办婚宴，谢绝散客，郁闷！优点是地理位置不错，朝南的房间可以看富春江，可惜给我的所谓高级房是朝北的，怪不得人家说携程的客人比较受歧视。,"The room is so small that the breakfast is not as bad as words, and it will never patronize.The South China Hotel next door looks good.In the evening, I wanted to eat at the restaurant in the hotel.The advantage is that the geographical location is good. The room facing the south can see Fuchunjiang. Unfortunately, the so -called senior room given to me is north. No wonder people say that Ctrip's guests are more discriminated against."
1,服务态度很好，早餐也有进步，性价比非常高。,"The service attitude is very good, the breakfast has improved, and the cost performance is very high."
0,强烈建议携程把它剔出去。前台的服务员好像来自人猿星球，如果你不催促可以让你等上1个小时不理你。入住和结账时老夫不得不大发雷霆才算搞定。房间简陋，早餐差，夜总会的音响扰民。服务水平0分以下。十分怀疑前面的打分者有托儿。补充点评2008年4月23日：老夫是一个温和的人，这一次是第一次大发脾气。实在是忍无可忍,"It is strongly recommended to pick it out.The waiter at the front desk seems to be from the Planet of the Ape. If you don't urge you, you can wait for an hour to ignore you.The old man had to get a big thunder when he stayed and settled.The room is simple, the breakfast is poor, and the sound of the nightclub disturb the people.The service level is less than 0 points.Very doubt that the scoring person has a nursery.Supplementary comment on April 23, 2008: The old man is a gentle person, this time is the first time to lose his temper.It's really unbearable"
1,2006年3月下旬入住过南湖宾馆后，当时酒店刚装修过。房间宽敞，布局合理，而且还有一张带台灯的玻璃书桌。2007年12月13-16日再次入住。宽带免费，有部分房间提供传真机。免费提供中西合璧早餐。中餐有豆浆、豆腐花、白粥、肉粥......每天都有更换不同的小菜。我最喜欢西式烟肉、肠仔、冷火腿。这是我再次入住的原因之一。无论从酒店外观、环境、服务综合指数都比较高。明年再到此入住。望服务水准有增无减。,"After staying at Nanhu Hotel in late March 2006, the hotel was just renovated.The room is spacious, the layout is reasonable, and there is a glass desk with a table lamp.Check in again on December 13-16, 2007.Broadband is free, and some rooms provide fax machines.Provide Chinese and Western breakfast for free.Chinese food has soy milk, tofu flowers, white porridge, meat porridge ... there are different side dishes every day.I like Western -style smoke, intestines, and cold ham.This is one of the reasons why I move in again.The comprehensive index of the hotel's appearance, environment, and service comprehensive index is relatively high.Let's stay here next year.The level of hopes of service has continued."
1,整体来说房间是不错的，住的是湖景B，周末竟然要将近1000元一晚。。。还好整个房间是完全面湖的。。。今天一看平时的房子只要500多。。。出血阿~~餐厅的服务不错，前台就真得不怎么样，前台的素质绝对需要提高~还有鄙视一下竟然湖景房都没有大床，逼着你订套房~,"Overall, the room is good. Lake Lake B, which is nearly 1,000 yuan a night on the weekend.EssenceEssenceFortunately, the entire room is completely lake.EssenceEssenceToday, I only look at the usual house only more than 500.EssenceEssenceBleeding ~~ The service of the restaurant is good, and the front desk is really not very good. The quality of the front desk needs to be improved ~ There is also a contempt for the lake scene without a big bed, forcing you to book a suite ~"
1,"地点离外摊及南京路很近,前台,行李服务人员都很好客热情.房间小巧玲珑,看得出在极有限的空间设计师花了很大的功夫.我住的是一间没有窗户的标准间.这也是一个不可多得的经历.如果一个人住,一两天OK.有所得必有所失.","The location is very close to the stall and Nanjing Road. The front desk and the luggage service staff are very good and enthusiastic.Between. This is also a rare experience. If a person lives alone, one or two days is OK. If you have something, you will lose."
1,我住的是新装修的东楼，感觉房间挺宽敞，设施也不错，相对于隔壁的香格里拉一店都不差。只是酒店其他方面例如大堂、西餐厅的环境和食物品种还需改进。否则价格差不太远，我还不如住香格里拉了。,"I live in the newly renovated east building. I feel that the room is very spacious and the facilities are also good. Compared with the Shangri -La shop next door, it is not bad.It is just that the environment and food varieties of the hotel, such as the lobby and the western restaurant, need to be improved.Otherwise, the price is not too far, and I might as well live in Shangri -La."
1,"最近我和几个朋友自驾游去扬州,经朋友介绍住在新世纪,第一感觉停车场特别大,可以同时停放约300--400辆车.房间舒适度很好,隔音效果也不错,该酒店最近重新装修，整体感觉挺好,酒店的服务很到位,物有所值.晚上用餐正好赶上他们的美食节,听说每年都有几次,真的很不错!","Recently, a few friends and I traveled to Yangzhou by themselves. I was introduced in the new century by my friends. The first feeling that the parking lot is particularly large. You can park about 300--400 vehicles at the same time. The room is very comfortable and the sound insulation effect is good.The hotel has been re -decorated recently. The overall feeling is good. The hotel's service is in place and it is worth it. The meal at night just caught up with their food festival. I heard that there are several times a year. It is really good!"
1,"不错的酒店,服务还可以,下次还会入住的~","Good hotel, service is okay, I will stay next time ~"
1,"住过很多次了,基本上还是挺满意的,交通也很方便,而且离建筑双年展非常近,我带着一家人散步过去很舒服.唯一不太好的地方是价格好象越来越贵了,看来我还是需要再发掘一些性价比更高的酒店.","I have lived many times, basically very satisfied, the transportation is also very convenient, and it is very close to the construction biennale. I take a family to take a walk. The only thing that is not good is that the price seems to be getting more and more.It is expensive, it seems that I still need to discover some cost -effective hotels."
0,网上看前一位老兄的评价订的房，12号只住一晚。刚到的时候的确很热情，安排司机去车站接我们。入住后黎阿姨（店主的妹妹）向我们介绍、推荐景点、行程安排之类的，因我们不喜欢事前安排，喜欢随性游玩，在和黎阿姨聊了一会后并没有让其安排，而是自行安排。在自行安排游玩中了解到，他们安排或者推荐游客都能有一定收益的。第二天，我们退房去游漓江（精华游，从兴坪到杨堤一段漓江），因为行李较多，所以特意问服务员是否可以在杨堤上岸直接去桂林。服务员也不清楚，就跑去问黎阿姨，回来后告知可以在杨堤直接去桂林。这样我们就背上所有行李去游漓江了。然而，实际上漓江精华游，是从阳朔乘车去兴坪镇，兴坪开始乘机动竹筏，逆流而上到杨堤附近，中间不下竹筏直接返回兴坪。这样，就是说我们要背着重重的行李来回跑，而当初的本意是在如果回桂林还是必须返回阳朔，我们就找地方寄存行李，不背着来回跑。很是不厚道啊！总体评价，风景不错，躺床上能看到如画的山山水水（景观房），但是不推荐住，因为到晚上之后就没什么可玩可做，只能去阳朔城里（其实在那里，不管什么宾馆，只要有窗，肯定能看到山水），回来还要找出租车或摩的；房间里边都没有宽带；最好自带洗漱用品；服务员还是很厚道、很淳朴的。,"Looking at the house of the previous brother on the Internet, only one night on the 12th.When I first arrived, I was really enthusiastic, and the driver was arranged to go to the station to pick us up.After check -in, Aunt Li (the sister of the owner) introduced us, recommended attractions, schedules, etc. to us, because we do not like to arrange beforehand, like to play with sex, and do not let him arrange after a while after a while, andIt is arranged by itself.I learned in their own arrangements that they arranged or recommended tourists to have a certain amount of benefits.The next day, we went out to travel to Lijiang (Essence, from Xingping to the Lijiang River from Xingping to Yangdi). Because there were many luggage, I asked the waiter if he could go to Guilin directly on Yangdi.The waiter didn't know, so he went to ask Aunt Li and told that he could go directly to Guilin at Yangdi.In this way, we carry all luggage to travel to Lijiang.However, in fact, the Essence of Lijiang River went to Xingping Town from Yangshuo. Xingping started to move the bamboo raft.In this way, that is, we have to run back and forth with heavy luggage, and the original intention was to return to Yangshuo if we returned to Guilin. We would find a place to store luggage and do not run back and forth.Very unkind!The overall evaluation, the scenery is good, you can see the picturesque mountains and rivers (landscape houses) on the bed, but it is not recommended, because there is no play to do after the evening, you can only go to YangshuoWhat kind of hotel, as long as there are windows, you can definitely see the landscape), and you have to find a taxi or motorcycle when you come back; there is no broadband in the room; it is best to bring your own toiletries; the waiter is still very kind and simple."
1,酒店设施还行，不过房间过小，价格相对一个小县城来说有点贵。,"The hotel facilities are okay, but the room is too small, and the price is a bit expensive than a small county."
0,订的单人间，结果没宽带，换了商务单人间，却是在后面的贵宾楼---一座四层小楼里。房间条件很一般，不过就是撤了一张床的标间。窗外就是院墙。房间隔音很差，听得到隔壁的鼾声。,"In the single-player, there was no broadband, and the business single room was changed, but it was in the VIP building behind-a four-story building.The room conditions are very average, but the standard room of a bed is withdrawn.Outside the window is the courtyard wall.The room's sound sound was poor and he heard the snoring sound next door."
1,总体感觉还不错。房间很干净、简洁。网上所披露的位于海河最美的一段，特意要了6层的房间，可是却没看到海河的影子……,"feels pretty good in general.The room is clean and simple.The most beautiful section of Haihe disclosed on the Internet. It took 6 floors of rooms, but I did not see the shadow of Haihe ..."
1,"位于市中心,交通方便,环境好.但房间小了点.","It is located in the city center, with convenient transportation and good environment. But the room is a bit smaller."
0,提前两天预定的三人间，1号早上八点多到的，登记时被告知没有三人间了，让我们先把行礼寄存先转转去，问前台中午来能有房间吗？回答的模凌两可：到时来再说吧！因为这趟主要是带小孩出来玩，考虑该宾馆地处闹市离王府井书店又近，而且周围宾馆就这一家有三人间，放假只三天时间紧也没太计较，连洗漱也没法做就直接出去玩了，到下午三点多来，满以为房间应该没问题，大人小孩都累了，想好好歇歇，哪知被告知还是没有三人间，让换标间，标间就标间吧可要求加床时（小孩虽然只12岁但已171厘米70多公斤和成人一样），又回答说无床可加，爱人和她理论时，竟然说：只能是这样，我也没办法！态度比较蛮横。我给携程打电话说明情况，携程又让她接电话，结果也没改变什么，我要求携程在附近再联系一家宾馆，后来前台打电话叫来一个经理有五十多岁，其态度还好，说一定给我们解决，经过约二十分钟总算给我们加了一张床，可房间太小，加床后已无多少空间，唉！勉强住吧！其他方面确实不敢恭维，整个宾馆是一个好像原来的单位机关楼之类改造的，完全是一招待所，在一个破烂的巷子内，商务客人避免入住（有失身份），早餐差，刚装修完，走廊房间还有味道，我爱人小孩对装修气味比较敏感，开了一夜窗户睡的。第二天出于对爱人孩子的歉意，通过携程换到离此不到100米的北方佳苑，四星标间638元，简直一个天上一个地下，并坚定的想，以后再带家人出来千万不能再住非星级的了，一定要住三星以上的，宁愿加床或挤一挤！,"The three -person room booked two days in advance, it arrived at 8 o'clock in the morning on the 1st, and was informed that there were no three people during the registration. Let's first register the salute first. Can I have a room at noon in the front ben?The answer to the answer: Let's talk about it!Because this trip is mainly to take children out to play, considering that the hotel is located in the downtown city and is close to Wangfujing Bookstore, and the surrounding hotels have three people in this family. The holidays are only three days old.Go out and play directly. By three o'clock in the afternoon, I thought that the room should be fine. Adults and children are tired. I want to rest well.You can ask for bed (although the child is only 12 years old, it is more than 171 cm and 70 kilograms as adults), and replied that when there is no bed without a bed, when the lover and her theory, they even said: It can only be that, I can't help it!The attitude is relatively horizontal.I called Ctrip to explain the situation, and Ctrip asked her to answer the phone again, but the result did not change anything. I asked Ctrip to contact a hotel nearby. Later, the front desk called a manager in his fifties.It is said that we must solve it. After about twenty minutes, we finally added a bed, but the room was too small, and there was no room for space after bed. Alas!Stop living!Other aspects do not dare to compliment. The entire hotel is a transformation like the original unit organs building. It is completely a guest house. In a tattered alley, business guests avoid staying (have lost identity).There is also a taste of the corridor room. My lover child is more sensitive to the smell of decoration, and I opened the window overnight to sleep.The next day, out of apology for her lover and children, it was replaced by Ctrip to the northern Jiayuan Garden, which was less than 100 meters away from this. The four -star standard room was 638 yuan.Do n’t live in the non -star, you must live above Samsung, prefer to add bed or squeeze!"
1,东莞的酒店在全国是出了名的性价比高，海悦算不错的，酒店有游泳池，去小游了一会，感觉不错。早餐品种也多，味道丰富。还忘了有个大堂经理是日本MM，好有气质！,"The hotel in Dongguan has a high cost -effectiveness in the country. Haiyue is good. The hotel has a swimming pool. It feels good for a while. It feels good.There are also many breakfast varieties and rich tastes.I also forgot that a lobby manager is Japanese MM, so temperament!"
1,位置非常好，去烟台山、东炮台、张裕葡萄酒博物馆非常近，海边步行街很漂亮，音乐喷泉也不错。缺点：商务标间（6601）中央空调的风机盘管保温做的不好，导致结露发霉；另外免费提供的拖鞋沾水后极滑!,"The location is very good. It is very close to Yantai Mountain, East Corridor, and Zhangyu Wine Museum. The seaside pedestrian street is beautiful and the music fountain is also good.Disadvantages: Business bidding room (6601) central air -conditioning fan disk tube insulation is not good, resulting in moldy mold; in addition, the free slippers provided for free to dip the water!"
1,"这次去金源他们的服务意识好象提高了,走进大堂会有人主动和我微笑,前台的态度也比原来热情了许多,感觉好点点了.原来啊,叫一个冷脸...也许以后会来的比较多,只是ctrip不提供含早餐的房间么?这点我觉得不够周到啊.房间这次住的是598的,似乎只是比498的楼层高点,其他再无任何区别.但事实上,金源头即使是同一层,他的房间有区别,有的我记得会大点,有的会小点,我是说即使价格一样的话,希望ctrip以后能向客人交代一下下.","This time, the awareness of their service in Jinyuan seems to have improved. When entering the lobby, someone will take the initiative to smile with me. The attitude of the front desk is much more enthusiastic than the original. It feels better.I will come more in the future, but Ctrip does not provide a room with breakfast? I don't think it is thoughtful enough. This time the room lives 598, it seems to be just a high point than 498, there is no different difference. But there is no different difference. But there is no difference.In fact, even if Jin Yuantou is the same layer, there is a difference between his room. Some I remember that it will be bigger, and some will be small. I mean that even if the price is the same, I hope that CTRIP can explain to the guests in the future."
1,"我是去年12月底入住的,到牡丹江的时候住的是夏威夷,后来搬到金鼎,主要是考虑早晨回北京时,酒店楼下就是机场巴士的始发站,如果住夏威夷的话要提早半个小时结帐再走到金鼎.酒店房间感觉还可以,就是我住的大床间没有浴缸,只有淋浴.至于房间大小,卫生，隔音及其他设施,我觉得都还好,地理位置也不错.","I stayed at the end of December last year. When I arrived at Mudanjiang, I lived in Hawaii. Later, I moved to Jin Ding. It was mainly to consider returning to Beijing in the morning.Go to Jin Ding. The hotel room feels okay. There is no bathtub in the large bed where I live. Only the shower. As for the size of the room, hygiene, sound insulation and other facilities, I think it's okay and the geographical location is good."
0,"酒店服务人员的服务素质有待提高,和入住的房价明显不成正比,我入住的房间床单上有血渍,服务人员居然推托说血渍是湿的,言下之意是我们自己弄上去的,标房里没有冰箱和浴袍,服务人员说因为房间从携程订的,便宜,意思不要计较,晚上烧水突然断电,服务人员又说是我们用了2个热水机烧水导致的.但温泉区的服务人员态度很好,与酒店服务人员的态度有着天壤之别,建议会员们只去泡温泉,不要入住酒店.早饭还可以,以中餐为主","The service quality of hotel service staff needs to be improved, which is obviously not directly proportional to the house prices in check -in. There are blood stains on the bed sheets I stayed in. The service staff actually entrusts that blood stains are wet.There is no refrigerator and bathrobe. The service staff said that because the room was ordered from Ctrip, cheap, do not care about it. Burning the water suddenly at night. The service staff said that we used 2 hot water machines to burn water.The attitude of the service staff is very good, and the attitude of the hotel service staff is very different. It is recommended that members only go to the hot spring and do not stay in the hotel. Breakfast is OK."
1,最实惠的635的套房优惠政策竟然对CTRIP不适用了，这令人很不解。直接打电话给它，它会有638元的优惠套房，很多优惠政策的。,"The most affordable 635 suite preferential policy is not applicable to CTRIP, which is puzzling.Call it directly, it will have a preferential suite of 638 yuan, many preferential policies."
0,"我是11月29日入住,12月1日离店的,由于我本人不慎将新买的皮鞋和一个仪器上的配件忘记在宾馆了,我给他们打电话,前台胡小姐态度很好又很耐心,在此表示感谢!但不知道为什么,前台的人就是找不到,我后来将客房服务中心的电话要来后,亲自给客房打电话,客房部接电话的人姓冯,说找到了,但皮鞋和配件分开了.我说那就把配件给我寄回来吧,我找了顺丰快递公司采取到付的方式,但皮鞋真的没有给我寄回来,我把这两样东西放在鞋盒子里怎么会分开了?具体印象,前台不错,客房这样工作就不怎么样了.","I stayed on November 29th and left the store on December 1st. Since I accidentally, I accidentally forgot about the newly bought leather shoes and accessories on a instrument at the hotel. I called them.I am very patient, thank you here! But I do n’t know why, the person at the front desk could n’t find it. After I came to the room service center, I called the rooms in person.It is separated, but the leather shoes and accessories are separated. I said that I would send me the accessories back. I found the method of receiving the payment of SF Express, but the leather shoes really did not send it to me. I put these two things inHow can I separate the shoe box? The specific impression is that the front desk is good, and the rooms work like this."
1,再加一句，好像上网也没有收费。最初是20元钱，但最近几次我入住的时候，直接连上网线就可以使用了。希望能够在洗浴小用品上多加改进。,"Add another sentence, it seems that there is no charge on the Internet.At first, it was 20 yuan, but when I stayed in the last few times, I could use it directly on the Internet.Hope to improve more on small baths."
0,住过几次米兰了，感觉越来越不好了，问题：1、10楼的宽带无法使用，超慢且不稳，而且请工作人员来了也解决不了；2、多个楼层多个房间的下水不通，且无人问津；3、结帐时超长时间的查房并且不理睬客人的追问。只所以还在住，唯一的是离办事地点近，看来只能远离这里了，找一个好地儿。宾馆反馈2007年11月30日：关于十楼宽带无法使用，酒店请来电信方面的维修人员发现有客人在房间内使用路由器，现此类问题已得到解决。楼层房间的下水不通，酒店工程部已逐个将客房排查，发现的确有房间存在下水较慢现象，现已全部解决。结帐超时间查房及不理睬客人的追问，酒店已对当事人进行相关处理，并通报批评所属部门经理。感谢您给我们提供的宝贵意见，我们非常期待您的再次光临。（为了便于携程客户入住愉快，我们特开设了总经理投诉专线，您只需在房内直拨8302即可）,"I have lived several times, and I feel that it is getting worse. Question: The broadband on the 1st and 10th floor cannot be used, it is super slow and unstable, and the staff can not solve it; 2. multiple floors and many roomsThe launch of the water is not connected, and no one is asking; 3. The inspection room at the checkout for a long time and ignore the guest's question.So I still live, the only thing is that it is close to the location of the work. It seems that I can only stay away from here and find a good place.Hotel feedback on November 30, 2007: Regarding the broadband on the tenth floor, the hotel invites the maintenance personnel in telecommunications to find that some guests use routers in the room. Such problems have been resolved.The launch of the floor room is not through, and the hotel engineering department has investigated the guest rooms one by one. It is found that there is indeed a slower launch in the room, which has been resolved.The time checkout of the checkout and ignoring the guests' questioning, the hotel has dealt with the parties related to the parties and reports the criticism manager of the affiliated department.Thank you for your valuable opinions, we are looking forward to your visit again.(In order to facilitate the happiness of Ctrip customers, we have specially opened a special line of complaints in the general manager. You only need to dial 8302 in the room)"
0,太差。就差是露宿街头了。携程把这样的酒店包括进来，实在是很幽默。十堰还有燕良大酒店，据说还行，为什么不去联系？这样我们也方便一些。,"Too bad.It's the streets.Ctrip including such a hotel is really humorous.Shiyan also has Yanliang Hotel. It is said that it is okay. Why not contact it?In this way, we are more convenient."
1,"每次去河南基本上都住这家酒店,环境设施都不错,房间宽敞,服务也好!","Every time I go to Henan, I basically live in this hotel. The environmental facilities are good, the room is spacious, and the service is good!"
1,最大的特点就是富丽堂皇、交通便利。位置相当好。从地铁里钻出来就来到了太古，被震撼了一把，太古就有万豪的入口。不论去哪里都很方便。酒店大堂挑空的非常气派，一走进来就是5星酒店的气势，感觉比国内的5星高了一个档次。我们订的海景房。窗户是三角形的，房间不算大。自动窗帘一拉开，就能看到维港，可惜被一个高楼挡了一半。每天都送水果，来打扫的服务员还会热情介绍景点。早餐很不错，可以看到海景。,"The biggest feature is the magnificent and convenient transportation.The location is pretty good.When I got out of the subway, I came to Taikoo, and I was shocked. There was a Marriott entrance in Tai ancient.It's convenient to go wherever you go.The hotel lobby is very gas -free, and when it comes in, it is the momentum of the 5 -star hotel. It feels a grade higher than the domestic 5 -star.We order the sea view room.The window is triangular, and the room is not large.As soon as the automatic curtain is opened, you can see Victoria Harbor, but unfortunately it was blocked by a high -rise building.Send fruits every day, and the waiters who come to clean will also introduce the attractions enthusiastically.Breakfast is very good, you can see the sea view."
1,来江门出差一直都住这个酒店，觉得性价比还可以,"I have been living in this hotel when I come to Jiangmen on a business trip, and I feel that the price is okay"
1,"酒店位置比起其他酒店来,离市中心稍远了点.走到春熙路要15分钟左右.河畔酒店其实只是在一条小河旁边,不要指望看河景.酒店房间还是可以的,比较干净.但是携程报的是200多,跑到那看见这是特价房,198元/晚.并没有享受到会员特价.酒店可能在当地比较出名,婚宴,寿筵没停过.按这个价格来说,酒店的早餐算挺好的.味道也可以.退房速度慢,要查些时候.","The hotel location is a bit farther away from the city center. It takes about 15 minutes to walk to Chunxi Road. The river bank is actually just next to a small river. Don't expect to see the river view. The hotel room is still okay. It is relatively clean.However, Ctrip reported more than 200. When I ran to see this is a special room, 198 yuan/night. I did not enjoy the membership special offer. The hotel may be more famous in the local area.The breakfast of the hotel is pretty good. The taste is also okay. The check -out speed is slow, and you need to check it."
0,"1.checkin的时候给的是1102房,打开门后发现已经有客人入住,而且是女士.十分尴尬.电话联络前台,要求自己下去更换,太无法接受了.其解释说本来是预留给我的房间,由于电话联络不到我就给别人.绝对不接受此说法:1,我电话一直开机,2.我是5点左右到的酒店,3,我用信用卡担保了2.换到909房间,发现是无烟房,再次电话联络,告知可以吸烟,呜呼,既然如此,何必设无烟房3.我定的是高级大床房,发现冲凉房和卫生间是分开的,并且冲凉房在房间的一个角落,不管怎么努力,水还是会流到房间.4.洗澡水的温度也就30度吧5.宽带速度不错.","1. Checkin is given room 1102. After opening the door, it is found that there are already guests who stay in, and it is very embarrassing. The phone contact the front desk and asked yourself to replace it. It is too unacceptable.

I have been on the phone, 2. I am a hotel at about 5 o'clock, 3, I use a credit card to guarantee 2. Change to Room 909 room 909 room 909It was found that it was a smoke -free house.

The temperature of the bath water is 30 degrees 5. The broadband speed is good."
1,在看过携程的点评入住的，订的女士楼层，总的来说非常不错，大堂有点小，倒也无伤大雅，房间因为全是套房，稍稍显局促了些，但是床真的是灰常灰常的舒服，粉粉的床具让人一见就忍不住“投身”进去，洗手间也显得稍小些，但还不错。早餐倒算干净，但品种太少。以后到深圳还会选择并且会推荐朋友入住的！,"After watching Ctrip's review, the ladies' floor, generally very good. The lobby is a bit small, but there is no harm. Because the room is all suite, it is slightly cooled, but the bed is really gray and often ashamed and often.For comfort, the powder of the powder makes people can't help but ""devote themselves"" at first sight. The toilet also looks a little smaller, but it is not bad.Breakfast is clean, but there are too few varieties.In the future, I will choose to choose and recommend friends to stay!"
1,房间大，装修好，服务佳。。。就房间而言，不逊于5星还会来住,"The room is large, good decoration, good service.EssenceEssenceAs far as the room is concerned, it is not inferior to 5 stars."
0,特价房间没有对外的窗户；房间与房间隔音效果太差,There are no external windows for special rooms; the sound insulation effect of the room and the room is too bad
0,我不太敢相信自己的眼睛，这叫四星级！？我将镜头从卫生间地面上的一根卷曲的毛发摇到斑驳的电视机前（注意是“摇”，不是“跟”哦！），妄图找到理由，未果！后来费了半天的劲打开了窗子，看到了貌似繁荣中央大街一角，我恍然大悟，原来这里的卖点不是硬件和软件，而是附件！“借鸡生蛋”的典故不住的从脑袋里冒出……我觉得这样的价格住华旗或者福顺天天更好。由于郁闷，住上一晚就走了，不知道早餐怎么样，其他方面也不太清楚，整体感觉暗暗的、旧旧的。推荐企图忆苦思甜、加强爱国主义教育的朋友来住！,"I don't dare to believe my eyes, this is called four -star!IntersectionI shook the camera from a curled hair on the ground floor of the bathroom to the mottled TV (note that ""shake"", not ""follow""!), Try to find the reason, not fruitful!Later, I opened the window for a long time, and saw that I seemed to prosper the corner of the Central Street. I suddenly realized that the selling point here was not hardware and software, but attachments!""By borrowing chicken eggs"", it is unable to come out of my head ... I think it is better to live in Huaqi or Fushun every day.Due to depression, I left for one night. I do n’t know how breakfast is. Other aspects are not clear.

1,"这么好的酒店,价格居然不高,感觉占便宜了似的.内部餐厅也不错,吃海鲜很好","Such a good hotel, the price is not high, it feels like it is cheap. Internal restaurants are also good, eating seafood is good"
1,地点位置，交通都不错。房间还可以，下次再来,"Location, traffic is good.The room is okay, come again next time"
1,还行吧，不算失望，离地铁2号线要走500M左右，但在中环旁边，自己开车去比较方便。,"It's okay, it's not disappointed. It is about 500m from Metro Line 2, but it is more convenient to drive by yourself next to Central."
1,酒店位置非常的好，客人每次都要点名入住。只是不知道为什么每次前台都为了吸烟区和非吸烟区和你捣糨糊，即便你预定时已经强调而且也得到了确认，前台也要试探着给你换成吸烟区做无烟处理，真真被打败了！,"The hotel location is very good, and the guests have to check in each time.I just don’t know why at the front desk for you to make a mess with you for the smoking area and non -smoke -absorbing area. Even if you have emphasized and confirmed it, you must try to replace you with a smoking area for smokeless treatment.I was defeated!"
0,这个酒店到还可以。但是最近两次住那里两晚以上，结果酒店每次都给携程说我只住了1晚就离店了，太不象话了，影响我的积分。酒店使这点小心眼，太不应该了！！！,"This hotel is okay.However, I lived there for more than two nights for the last two times. As a result, the hotel told Ctrip every time I just left the shop for only one night. It was too unreasonable and affected my points.The hotel makes this cautious, too should not be!IntersectionIntersection"
0,酒店外观看起来不错，但房间内的物品实在是太陈旧了，席梦思床竟然是左右高低不平的，一躺下人就会滚向一边，致电管家部后，很快来了一位服务生，也没怎么看情况，就动作熟练地干开了：将被子、枕头、床单等往行李桌上一扔，再将席梦思床翻个身，最后再将床单什么的一铺，整个动作非常连贯，真是一气呵成，看得出来，同样的事情服务生们做得多了。浴室内的大浴巾磨损得非常非常薄了，在别的酒店里早就不会再拿出来给客人用了，拖鞋象纸一样的都坚持不了多久的，梳子也没有的。电视频道也非常少，HBO什么的就别想了。优点就是酒店附近交通非常方便，多条公交车都有站点的，附近的饭店也比较多，吃饭不成问题。,"The appearance of the hotel looks good, but the items in the room are too old. Xi Meng thought that the bed was uneven from left and right. As soon as the person lay down, he would roll aside. After the call of the call, he soon came to a waiter.I did n’t look at the situation, so I started to do it skillfully: throw the quilt, pillow, bed sheet, etc. on the luggage table, then turn over Xi Meng thought about the bed, and finally put the sheets or something. The whole action is very coherent.It can be seen in one go, and it can be seen that the same things have done a lot of waiters.The large bath towels in the bathroom are very thin, and they will not be used for guests in other hotels. Sliprs will not last long like paper, and there are no combs.There are also very few TV channels, don't think about HBO or something.The advantage is that the transportation near the hotel is very convenient. Many buses have sites, and there are more restaurants nearby. Eating is not a problem."
1,门卡无故被停用，无法开门，要到总台重新办理才能开门，很不方便。希望能改进。,"The door card was suspended for no reason, and the door could not be opened. It was inconvenient to open the door to the head of the station.Hope to improve."
1,第一次老定酒店，老反映不,"For the first time, I always reflected"
1,"我是第三次入住了,但是给这家宾馆留言还是第一次,,这次入住我的一位朋友喝醉了,走到大厅我朋友就""现场直播""了~~~~~呵呵,他们有几位服务员都主动来帮我,有一位服务员还帮我把我朋友背到了房间,过后他们值班经理还打电话到我房间询问我朋友的情况,这里的服务真的挺让我感动的,我下次还会入住这家宾馆.","I was in the third time, but I was the first time to leave a message to this hotel. This time, a friend who stayed in me was drunk. When I walked to the lobby, my friend would be ""live"" on the spot ~~~~~Several waiters of them took the initiative to help me, and a waiter helped me carry my friend to the room. After that, their duty manager also called my room to ask my friends. The service here really touched me.I will stay in this hotel next time."
0,服务态度极差。预定的房间告诉我没有，说要加钱升级才有。我说我已经用信用卡担保，服务员很坚决地说没有收到，没钱可以走。,"The service attitude is very poor.The booking room told me not, saying that it would be possible to increase money.I said that I had used a credit card guarantee, and the waiter resolutely said that I did not receive it, and I had no money to leave."
0,"小木屋的隔音相当差,而且房间间隔很近,门口就是过道.由于游客的作息时间都不一样，所以被隔壁洗澡，冲马桶,早上起来看日出的声音严重干扰.房间门口就是公共过道，隔壁一个韩国人半夜跑出来打电话，叽里呱啦的不知道说什么,我出去用英文请他离开.还好他识趣的走开。房间还行,就是床小了，只有1米宽.有热水,热水很热，不错。","The sound insulation of the cabin is quite poor, and the room interval is very close. At the door is the aisle. Because the tourists' schedules are different, they are taken to the next door and rushed to the toilet.A Korean came out in the middle of the night and called in the middle of the night. He didn't know what to say. I went out and asked him to leave in English. Fortunately, he walked away.The room is okay, that is, the bed is small, only 1 meter wide. It has hot water, hot water is very hot, good."
0,酒店设施还行，服务超级差，服务态度也很不好，我们本来是在这里开会，结果各个部分互相之间很难沟通哦,"The hotel facilities are okay, the service is super poor, and the service attitude is very bad. We were originally a meeting here. As a result, it is difficult to communicate with each other."
1,1.酒店设施比较旧2.早餐还是秉持较高的水平3.临近医院4.如果有条件可以入住同一个集团下的就在旁边的洲际酒店,"1. The hotel facilities are relatively old 2. Breakfast is still a high level 3. Near the hospital 4. If possible, you can stay in the same group under the same group."
1,温州人开的酒店，就是这副样子。总的来说还好，就是档次上不去。顶楼的餐厅不错，台塑牛扒很好。,"The hotel opened by Wenzhou is like this.Overall, it is okay, but the grade can't go up.The restaurant on the top floor is good, and Formosa Plastics is very good."
1,"他们家的床太硬了,睡得腰算背痛!房间有些陈旧,隔音也不是太好,半夜正好有几个人入住相隔的房间,那个声音啊,反正是吵到了(不过这和入住人的素质更有关系)!房间内没有电热水壶,只有一壶","Their beds are too hard, sleep back pain! The room is old, and the sound insulation is not very good. There are several people in the middle of the night to stay in the room separated by.The quality is more related)! There is no electric kettle in the room, there is only one pot"
1,"性价比算可以的,除了房间水龙流的水少点,空调小点外,其他都还不错.","The price / performance ratio is okay. Except for the water flow of the room, there are less water and small air conditioners, everything else is good."
1,"还不错,下次有机会的话或许还会住这里~~~","Not bad, if you have a chance next time, you may still live here ~~~"
0,不能够提供按照预定的房间要求，明明是要求两间大床房，当天到了之后才告知没有，而且只给了一个标准间，并且最开始连冷气都是坏的，北京40度的高温，不知道这里到底是酒店还是桑拿房,"It is not possible to provide two large beds as required to be required to be required to be required. Only after the same day, it is notified that it is given a standard room. At the beginningKnow whether it is a hotel or a sauna?"
1,这家酒店在滨州算是最好的了。整体服务水准还不错。房间一般，没有留下太深的印象，自助餐还可以，值得一吃。,"This hotel is the best in Binzhou.The overall service level is not bad.The room is average, and there is no deep impression. The buffet is okay and it is worth eating."
1,房间总的来说还不错，早餐做为四星级酒店来说一般。酒店外面小吃或者一般的酒店少总的来说，对我这样出差的人来说还不错了,"The room is generally good. Breakfast is a four -star hotel.Snacks outside the hotel or general hotels are small, for people who travel like me, it's not bad"
1,中归中举的酒店，但地理位置特别好，价格也还能接受，下次来应该还会在住这里,"The hotel in China, but the geographical location is particularly good, and the price is still acceptable. Next time, you should still live here"
1,2月7日至10日入住该酒店，酒店房间安排在35层，可以看到一半海景、一半山景，非常棒。酒店服务很好，每天都有新鲜水果赠送，2月9日恰逢先生过生日，酒店还专门赠送了一盒巧克力，非常周到体贴、服务很人性化，下次再去香港，我还会选择入住该酒店。,"Check in the hotel from February 7th to 10th. The hotel room is arranged on the 35th floor. You can see half of the sea view and half of the mountain view.The hotel service is very good, and fresh fruit is given away every day. On February 9, when Mr. ’s birthday, the hotel also specially presented a box of chocolates.Check in the hotel."
1,mini套房有惊有喜：惊的是：1床好短，我身高不足1米70，脚已几乎在边缘；2宣传册里的多种选择枕头，竟数不存在，服务小姐讲从来都没有，也不知几时有。。。搞得我一头雾水，那宣传得这么热闹。。。；3卫生间格局太小，设计不够人性化，最糟糕的是下水道的味道刺鼻，让人郁闷,"The MINI suite is surprised and happy: surprising is: 1 bed is short, I am less than 1.70 meters tall, and my feet are almost on the edge; the multiple choice pillows in the 2 brochure not exist, and the service lady has never said that there is never.I don't know when there is.EssenceEssenceI was confused, and the promotion was so lively.EssenceEssence; 3 The bathroom structure is too small, the design is not human enough, the worst is the pungent taste of the sewer, which makes people depressed"
1,这个酒店比后面的仙人掌差了太多了感觉，以后还是住仙人掌了，虽然仙人掌离海远了点。说道海，亚龙湾的海临近海底世界这块真是太差劲了，窄窄的一溜沙滩，上面人暴多，而且垃圾特多，晕，我们走了好远到其他的酒店的沙滩上去蹭了半天。价格比较便宜，但是和仙人掌比也差不多。估计以后不会住这个酒店了，也对亚龙湾比较失望，还不如大东海的沙滩呢。房间什么的也差不多，就不说了。,"This hotel feels much worse than the cactus behind it. In the future, he still lives in the cactus, although the cactus has a farther away from the sea.Speaking of the sea, the sea in the sea near the sea is really too bad. The narrow beach is a lot of people on the beach, and there are a lot of garbage and dizzy. We walked to the beach of other hotels for a long time.The price is cheaper, but it is similar to the cactus.It is estimated that this hotel will not be available in the future, and it is also disappointed with Yalong Bay. It is not as good as the beach of the Dadonghai.The room is almost the same, so I won't say it."
0,"这个酒店如果不坐落在南湖边上,那就是一个招待所的级别.我们订了758的标间,却只有一张早餐券.另外一人要吃早餐,要68元,且无论你是大人还是孩子!而且早餐平种很少.我们住的房间墙纸也掉下来了.去的时候正好下雨,走道上还在漏水.而且酒店没有行李车帮客人搬行李.真不知道它这个五星是怎么评的.也许是当地政府行为吧.一个性价比不值的酒店!","If this hotel is not located on the side of the South Lake, it is a level of a guest house. We have ordered the 758 standard room, but there is only one breakfast coupon. The other person has to eat breakfast, 68 yuan, and whether you are an adult or a child.And there are very few breakfast species. The wallpaper of our room has fallen. When we go, it happens to be raining, and the aisle is still leaking on the aisle. And the hotel does not have a luggage car to help the guests move luggage. I really don’t know how this five -star comments.Maybe it is the local government's behavior. A hotel with a price -performance ratio!"
1,位置：闹中取静，交通便利。门前有小型超市，东西一应俱全。老鸭粉丝小吃，酒店餐厅伙食也不错。步行离久光5分钟路程、离南京西路大型购物商场恒龙广场、梅龙镇、中信泰富20分钟，与淮海路平行，上街购物超级棒！房间：我住豪华双人间，环境不错，干净卫生，24小时热水，冷暖空调都有，还有杂志供阅读。唯一美中不足是电视有些小。服务态度也不错能及时反馈客人要求。下次去还会住。,"Location: Quiet in trouble and convenient transportation.There are small supermarkets in front of the door, which is available.Old duck fan snacks, hotel restaurant meals are also good.Walking for a long time for 5 minutes, 20 minutes from the large -scale shopping malls from Nanjing West Road, 20 minutes, and CITIC Taifu, parallel to Huaihai Road, shopping on the street is super great!Room: I live in a luxurious double room, the environment is good, clean and hygienic, 24 hours of hot water, warm and cold air conditioners, and magazines for reading.The only lack of beauty is that the TV is a bit small.The attitude attitude attitude is also good to feedback guest requirements in time.I will live next time."
0,酒店总体还可以，前台服务态度一般，房间气味比较重，跟其他的经济型酒店比并没有太大的优势。,"The hotel is generally okay. The service attitude of the front desk is average, and the smell of the room is relatively heavy. It does not have much advantage compared with other economic hotels."
1,"洗澡很麻烦,房间的热水很难调得合适,要么冷要么热得无法伸手,问我通行的朋友,我一起住的五个人都遇到如此的问题.早餐很差!服务员态度还可以.宾馆反馈2007年12月28日：首先，十分感谢朋友们对我店的大力支持！对于以上两位客人所提冷热水交换所出现的问","It ’s troublesome to take a bath. It is difficult to adjust the hot water in the room. Either it is cold or hot and unable to reach out. Ask my friends who pass, the five people I live together encountered such problems. Breakfast is very poor! The waiter's attitude is okay.Hotel feedback on December 28, 2007: First of all, thank you friends for their strong support for our store!Asked about the exchanges between the above two guests"
0,入住这个酒店，应该算是被携程给误导了，把它放在了第一选择位置。如果酒店介绍加上一条说明“紧邻坟场”，估计生意全没了。丽悦（还有丽都）真该好好感谢携程。,"Checking in this hotel should be misleaded by Ctrip and put it in the first choice.If the hotel introduction adds a description ""close to the cemetery"", it is estimated that the business is gone.Liyue (and Lidu) should really thank Ctrip."
1,"外观旧,停车场小,乱,还另外收钱,不过酒店还干净.","The appearance is old, the parking lot is small, chaotic, and the money is collected separately, but the hotel is still clean."
1,"交通便利,位于市中心;设置齐备,有车库.不足处是临街隔音效果太差,建议用双层窗户,其次为过道隔音不好,建议能都铺上厚点的地毯．总体而言，这家酒店性价比还可以．","Convenient transportation, located in the city center; set up together, garage. The shortcoming is that the sound insulation effect of the street is too poor. It is recommended to use double -layer windows, followed by the aisle sound insulation. It is recommended to spread a thicker carpet.Overall, this hotel is cost -effective."
1,五月底入住的该宾馆，对于三星来说还是可以的，价钱不贵，可能它的位置不是繁华地吧。就是前台的收款的服务员态度挺差的，房间不错，可能是从携程订的原因，一般安排的房间位置都还是不错的。,"The hotel where it stays at the end of May is still OK for Samsung. The price is not expensive. It may not be a bustling place.That is, the waiter at the front desk is very poor, and the room is good. It may be the reason for the booking from Ctrip. The location of the room is still good."
0,这家酒店服务很不好，故意刁难顾客，明明可以刷卡却不让刷卡，逼迫顾客付现钞。客房价格偏高。建议将该酒店从携程的清单中取消。,"This hotel has a bad service. It deliberately makes it difficult for customers. It can obviously swipe the card but not let the card swipe, forcing customers to pay for the banknote.The price of the rooms is high.It is recommended to cancel the hotel from Ctrip's list."
1,地理位置还是比较好的，附近有家乐福、太平洋等购物中心。房间还可以，不错,"The geographical location is still relatively good. There are shopping malls such as Carrefour and Pacific nearby.The room is okay, not bad"
0,豪华大床房房间大小一般，墙壁看起来很不舒服，都有掉落的斑驳痕迹，其他一般，在所有住过的经济型酒店里算差，比火车站那家168要差。另外对酒店的服务水准非常有质疑，当天入住时，身份证给予登记后竟然没有还给我，而且当时前台就发现了，可以她一没有主动送还到我房间，二连电话通知我一下都没有，顺手夹在了他们的工作板里，想当然的认为第二天的前台在我退房时会将其交换，可是第二天退房时并没有退还，直到当天下午我在庐山的宾馆要登记时，才发现身份证遍寻不着，心里琢磨只有可能遗忘在了该酒店，电话过去前台找了半天，终于发现。由于这个工作失误，导致我的行程被打乱，最后不得不取消了庐山机场起飞的航班，再次回到南昌去取身份证，在要求报销到酒店的打车费15元时，还非常的不爽气，当时大堂经理询问总经理后给我的回复是：这种事情是酒店经常会发生的，我们酒店是从来没有规定为旅客报销车费的，如果要报销只有让前台自己赔偿你们15元。我认为说这种话是很不职业的，我作为住客面对的是你们酒店，是和你们酒店的交涉，而不是和你们的员工，赔偿也是酒店方对住客的赔偿，具体你们企业内部如何进行责任认定和教育那时你们内部的事，是不用和客人解释的。最后在送我们出门时，他们的大堂经理还说了一句，我们这种商务性酒店出这种那种问题是很正常的，让人听了十分的不解和不舒服。有这种心态管理的酒店我表示遗憾。这是我第一次入住该集团的酒店，我相信也是最后一次。,"The size of a large -scale bedroom room is average, and the walls look very uncomfortable. There are mottled traces of falling. Others are generally poor in all the restaurant hotels, which is worse than the 168 of the railway station.In addition, the hotel service level is very doubtful. When the ID card was registered on the same day, I did not return it to me after the ID card was registered.No, it was sandwiched in their working board, and took it for granted that the front desk of the next day would exchange it when I check out, but I did not return the next day when I check out. Until the afternoon of that afternoon, I was in the hotel in Lushan.When registering, I found that the ID card could not be found. I thought that I could only forget it at the hotel. After the phone went to the front desk for a long time, I finally found out.Due to this job error, my schedule was disrupted. In the end, I had to cancel the flight of Lushan Airport. I returned to Nanchang to get my ID card again. When the taxi fee required to reimburse was 15 yuan, it was still very uncomfortable.Qi, at that time, the lobby manager asked the general manager to give me the reply: This kind of thing often happened in the hotel. Our hotel has never stipulated that passengers will reimburse the car fee.I think this kind of words are very unscrupulous. As a guest, I face your hotel, negotiate with your hotel, not your employees.How to identify and educate internal responsibility and educate at that time, there is no need to explain to the guests.Finally, when they were sent to us out, their lobby manager also said that such a kind of problem such a business hotel is normal, which makes people listen to very puzzling and uncomfortable.I regret the hotel with such mentality management.This is the first time I stayed at the group's hotel. I believe it is the last time."
0,差，房间怎么样我不清楚。是给客人订的，一月份的天气，听客人说居然没有暖气供应。好像是说入住的人少了，暖气给关掉了，怎么有这样的宾馆。,"I don't know how to do the room.It was booked for the guests. In the weather in January, I heard the guests say that there was no heating supply.It seems that there are fewer people who check in, and the heating is turned off. How can there be such a hotel."
0,陈旧不堪，朝向不好。有众多不文明的现象。老板在吧台内的动作滑稽可笑。,"Old and unbearable, facing bad.There are many uncivilized phenomena.The boss's movement on the bar is funny."
1,房间很舒适也很干净，周围虽然不热闹但很安静，离虹桥机场很静，平时价格很贵但因为入住时正逢春节假期所以价格超值！！！,"The room is very comfortable and clean. Although it is not lively, it is quiet. It is very quiet from Hongqiao Airport. The price is very expensive, but because it is during the stay in the Spring Festival holiday, the price is value -for -money!IntersectionIntersection"
1,酒店位置较隐蔽，不过胡同口就有其它的大酒店所以打车还算是方便，离王府井也不远。标准大床间，房间还行，在北京来说性价比不错，比如家强，房价大，舒服多了，而且很安静。服务还不错。,"The hotel location is more hidden, but there are other hotels in the Hutong, so it is convenient to take a taxi and not far from Wangfujing.In the standard large bed, the room is still there. In Beijing, the price / performance ratio is good. For example, the family is strong, the house price is large, it is much more comfortable, and it is very quiet.The service is not bad."
0,房间小，服务水平差（原来开的房间房卡进不去，又换一间），环境吵（外面车来车往），卫生间不干净，价格不低，下次肯定不会去了。不过，天津总体感觉都不好，不光光是酒店，还不如南方的小城市。,"The room is small, the service level is poor (the original room room card cannot be entered, and another one), the environment is noisy (the car outside the car), the bathroom is not clean, the price is not low, and it will definitely not go next time.However, Tianjin feels bad in general, not only a hotel, but not as good as the small cities in the south."
1,酒店的位置较好，出了火车站坐8路车就能到酒店，酒店后门就是洋人街，交通很方便。装修也很好，特别是前台的白族小姐态度超好，早餐也很丰富。是个不错的酒店，下次去的话还会去住。,"The hotel has a good location. You can get to the hotel when you take the 8 bus on the train station. The back door of the hotel is foreigners.The decoration is also very good, especially Miss Bai at the front desk is super good, and breakfast is very rich.It is a good hotel, and I will stay next time."
1,准确的说，酒店的环境很漂亮，房间设施也还行，可以算4星标准。但是，卫生间下水道的气味实在是让人受不了整个房间都是臭味。开窗、开门、开抽风，几个小时味道都去不掉。早上checkout很慢，有很多旅游团的赶着退房，前台站了5、6个服务员，只有1个服务员能处理，其他都是实习生。太没有5星级的样子了。宾馆反馈2008年6月29日：感谢您的点评！我们已将相关问题呈酒店管理层予以关注，欢迎下次光临！,"To be precise, the hotel's environment is very beautiful, and the room facilities are okay, which can be counted as 4 -star standard.However, the scent of the bathroom's sewer really makes people unbearable the whole room.Open the window, open the door, open the wind, and the taste can not be removed for a few hours.In the morning, Checkout was very slow. Many tourist groups rushed to check out. There were 5 or 6 waiters on the front desk. Only one waiter could handle it. The others were interns.There is no 5 -star look.Hotel feedback on June 29, 2008: Thank you for your comments!We have attracted relevant issues in the hotel management, welcome to come next time!"
0,这个酒店很一般！甚至说不好！就有一点离“红门”很近，徒步爬泰山比较方便，但做车上泰山不方便，服务有好有坏，第一天凌晨到宾馆寄存东西，我跑了三趟拿东西，打搅服务员三次睡觉，但并没有不悦的表情，感觉很好！但晚上住在宾馆我提出用一下公用电脑到些照片，另外一个服务员，用话搪塞我！有点不高兴！其他宾馆都有公用电脑满足来宾的上网或倒照片的需要，他们却搪塞！很失望！还有宾馆的被子感觉不是很干净，还摆了些乱七八糟的东西（都是收费的），还有避孕套和男女洗液，很是搞笑！（当然这些都收费）！害的我牙刷都没敢用他们的，不是怕付钱而是怕脏！o(∩_∩)o...不过话说回来携程在泰安找的宾馆都不怎么样！,"This hotel is very average!Even if it is not good!There is a little bit close to the ""Red Gate"". It is more convenient to climb in Mount Tai, but it is inconvenient to do the Mount Tai on the car.Sleeping three times, but there is no unhappy expression, it feels good!But I stayed at the hotel at night. I proposed to use public computers to some photos, another waiter, and used to fool me!A little unhappy!Other hotels have the needs of public computers to meet the needs of guests' Internet or pouring photos, but they are obscured!Very disappointed!There are also hotels in the hotel that don't feel very clean, and there are some messy things (all charges), as well as condoms and men's and women's washing fluid, which is funny!(Of course these are charges)!I didn't dare to use them to the toothbrush, not afraid of paying but dirty!o (o_∩) o ... But then, it is not good to come back to the hotel found in Tai'an!"
1,"我是12月23--26晚住在港威,由于此行的目的就是圣诞节购物,因此觉得特别的方便,而且平安夜广东道上的零点倒数活动就在我的房间楼下进行,酒店内的硬件设施还好,卫生间挺大的,每天送新鲜的水果,服务也不错,唯一的缺点当然是价格咯!","I lived in Hong Kong Wei on December 23--26.

1,酒店离海边很近，入住的4楼在房间可以看到海。但离火车站和长途汽车站太远了，交通不太方便。头天问过服务员早上6点左右退房是否需要预定的士，服务员说随时都有的士不用预定，结果第二天早上寒风中在酒店门口等了半天才打到车。,"The hotel is very close to the seaside, and you can see the sea on the 4th floor of the room.But it is too far away from the railway station and long -distance bus station, and the traffic is not convenient.I asked the waiter the day before whether to check out whether the taxi was required to check out at about 6 o'clock in the morning. The waiter said that there were no schedules at any time. As a result, the next morning, I waited for a long time in the hotel door in the cold wind before getting to the car."
0,非常非常一般的酒店，无法跟如家或者莫泰比，居然还称之为是环保经济型酒店，汗啊。第一次见到房间里有燃气热水器，还是“前锋”的，是那种开了之后发出哄哄声响的！！！床也不舒服，垫被会移动，毛毯。。。古老的毛毯啊，已经十年没见过乐。唯一称赞的是地理位置，附近吃的喝的倒是有很多。,"A very, very ordinary hotel, cannot follow the home or Motobi. It is also called an environmentally friendly and economical hotel, sweat.The first time I saw a gas water heater in the room, or the ""forward"", it was the kind of coaxing after opening!IntersectionIntersectionThe bed is also uncomfortable, the cushion is moved, and the blanket.EssenceEssenceAncient blankets have not been happy for ten years.The only praise is the geographical location, and there are many foods and drinking nearby."
1,我是十一全家去的，酒店整体设施不错，服务也好，还有免费接机，车是本田雅阁，当穿着制服的门童拿着牌子在机场出口等我们时，儿子还是挺兴奋的。地理位置在市区，因为是下午的飞机，晚上到后，在周边逛逛，挺热闹的。第二天就搬到风景区住了，方便些。它和风景区的距离是14公里。如果出差，可以选择。,"I went to the eleven family. The overall facility of the hotel was good, the service was good, and there was a free pick -up. The car was Honda Accord. When the door of the uniform took the brand to export us at the airport, the son was very excited.The geographical location is in the urban area, because it is a plane in the afternoon. After arriving at night, walk around, it is very lively.It was more convenient to move to the scenic area the next day.It is 14 kilometers away from the scenic area.If you are on a business trip, you can choose."
0,"这是我住过的一家全国最差的四星级酒店.进房给你第一的感慨是灯光灰暗,我想看报只能去卫生间看,因卫生间照明亮度才能达到.我是晚上9点多进酒店,11点多想洗澡,却开不出热水,打电话给总台才知是市里供热管道出了问题,要我耐心等待.直到半夜1点多还是没供上,我又找了酒店值班柳经理,本人一天长途从上海开车12个小时到威海,就是能洗个澡好好休息","This is the worst four -star hotel in the country I have lived. The first emotion for entering the house to give you is dark. I want to read newspapers to go to the bathroom to see it, because the lighting of the bathroom can be achieved.Entering the hotel more, I want to take a bath at 11 o'clock, but I ca n’t drive hot water. I called the main station to know that there was a problem with the heating pipe in the city. I asked me to wait patiently. Until 1 o'clock in the middleI found the hotel on duty again. I drove from Shanghai for 12 hours a day to Weihai. I can take a bath and take a good rest"
0,酒店只能用几个字来形容，脏乱差，半夜三更有按摩小姐骚扰你，让你休息不好！如果你抗议，小姐会告诉你这是他们的协议！不知道什么协议？,"The hotel can only be described in a few words, the dirty and messy, and the lady in the middle of the night to harass you and make you a bad rest!If you protest, the lady will tell you that this is their agreement!I don't know what agreement?"
1,"地理位置佳.只是,所订的附楼与白鹭洲大酒店主楼是两码事.原来好像叫矿业大厦.现在与白鹭洲酒店合营吧.房间比较大,只是装修等相对比较旧了.刚开房间门有一点点霉味.好在只是在那里睡了5,6个小时而已.唯一的优点:靠近沅当湖,早晨起来空气清新.","Good geographical location.

0,非常差，入住半小时就想退房了，地毯很脏，浴缸里特别恶心，什么都有：头发，灰泥等而且，根本没有什么游泳池，携程的宣传也有问题我本来定了两天，住了一晚就退房了，很巧，退房的时候旁边一个哥们跟我遭遇一样，他边退房边打携程的电话定下一个酒店……我是online定好了~,"Very bad, I want to check out for half an hour, the carpet is dirty, and the bathtub is particularly nauseous. There are all: hair, mud, etc., and there are no swimming pools at all.After one night, I got out of the room. Coincidentally, a buddy next to him encountered me when he was out."
1,优越：地理位置、观景阳台、六层露天餐厅。不过六层露天餐厅等位时间比较长，电话预定的时候告诉我预定已经满了，只好排号，为了在露天平台上用餐，我等了40分钟。房间和阳台都比较小、电梯更小，前台人员比较少，如果客人多的时候，需要等候。,"Superior: geographical location, viewing balcony, six -story open -air restaurant.However, the six -layer open -air restaurant has been waiting for a long time. When the phone is booking, I told me that the booking was full. I had to rank. In order to eat on the open -air platform, I waited for 40 minutes.The rooms and balconies are relatively small, the elevator is smaller, and there are fewer personnel at the front desk. If there are many guests, they need to wait."
1,本次入住酒店的网络不是很稳定，断断续续，希望能够改进。,"The network staying in the hotel is not very stable, intermittently, hoping to improve."

1,在阳朔算相当好的酒店，虽然设施有点旧，但胜在地理位置好，人性化服务。尤其是酒店的取电匙与开门卡分开就是很好的服务，天气酷热，回到冷气依旧充足的房间，绝对是一种享受。尽管这样有点浪费能源，但这个天气，我们住了三晚，如果不保留空调，买的水果估计会臭在里面。因为吸取了其他携友的经验，住在靠居民区那边的房间，十分安静。既能享受逛西街的便利，又能得到安逸的睡眠，确实是不错。BTW，酒店房间能达到标三星的大小，比桂林四季春天所谓的四星标准要大，空间的大小也算比较放松舒适补充点评2008年8月2日：美中不足：没有电梯，不过服务生可免费提供行李提上提下服务,"In the hotel that is quite good in Yangshuo, although the facilities are a bit old, they are better in geographical location and humanized services.Especially the hotel's electric spoon is very good to separate from the door opening card. The weather is hot and returning to the room where air -conditioning is still sufficient. It is definitely a enjoyment.Although this is a bit wasteful, this weather, we lived for three nights. If the air conditioner is not kept, the fruits bought will probably smell inside.Because of the experience of other friends with friends, living in the room in the residential area is very quiet.It is really good to enjoy the convenience of shopping in the West Street, but also getting comfortable sleep.BTW, the hotel room can reach the size of Samsung, which is larger than the so -called four -star standard in the spring of Guilin Four Seasons.Provide luggage up and down service"

1,酒店很不错，环境好，安静，大堂非常气派，我们订的青春套房，房间很大也很舒服。酒店的西餐还不错，就是服务费高了些，加收15%，午餐的时候我们点了一份肉酱烩意粉和一个葡国鸡套餐，一共不到80元，但是加了服务费就是99元了。从酒店自驾回深圳，到香蜜湖我们花了大约1个小时，路上不堵车，还是很方便的。以后去白水寨，还会选择这家酒店。,"The hotel is very good, the environment is good, quiet, the lobby is very aggressive, the youth suite we ordered, the room is very large and comfortable.The Western food in the hotel is not bad, that is, the service fee is higher, and the service fee is higher, adding 15%. During lunch, we ordered a meat sauce stew and a Portuguese chicken package for less than 80 yuan.99 yuan.It took about an hour to return to Shenzhen from the hotel to Shenzhen, and we spent about an hour. It is still very convenient to have no traffic jam on the road.In the future, go to Baishui Village and choose this hotel."
1,比较老的五星级酒店，酒店的管理维护还是很好,"The older five -star hotel, the management and maintenance of the hotel are still very good"
1,位置不错，市中心交通便利，环境又比较安静。酒店边上有一条街很多小吃店，比较便利。服务挺好，房间设施比较人性化。早餐一般，刚开始和快结束时，几乎没什么吃的。饮料很少而且供应量也不足。酒店有自己的洗衣房，速度很快基本上是当天能送回，而且价格也不算贵。,"The location is good, the city center is convenient, and the environment is relatively quiet.There is a snack bar on the side of the hotel, which is more convenient.The service is very good, and the room facilities are more humane.Breakfast is average. At the beginning and fast end, there is almost nothing to eat.There are few drinks and insufficient supply.The hotel has its own laundry room. The speed is basically returned that day, and the price is not expensive."
1,位置挺远的，到市区要好久早餐一般，可选择的余地小房间好，大，感觉还是很舒服的,"The location is quite long, and it takes a long breakfast in the urban area. The room you can choose from is good, big, it feels very comfortable."

1,交通便利，价钱算是国际展览中心附近偏低的了，参加展览会入住这里还算合适。就是酒店前台把我在Ctrip的预定信息搞错了还死也不承认，服务人员的素质差了点。,"Convenient transportation, the price is low near the International Exhibition Center, and it is still appropriate to participate in the exhibition.That is, the hotel's front desk has missed my booking information in CTRIP and did not admit it. The quality of the service staff was a little worse."
1,环境很好，算得上度假胜地，带露台、电脑的房间很让人愉悦。服务真的很一般很一般，办入住手续的时候居然可以连钥匙牌都给错。我们订的是一间普通套房和一间景观标间，在标间的订单中还特别注明要带景观的（这好像是废话？结果事实证明一点都不废），总台给的房间是一间带露台的套房和一间不带露台的套房。所谓套房也就是多一个麻将室，因我们之前查到酒店自己的网站上写着“景观房有露天阳台”，我们以为朝北的客房没有露台所以做成了麻将室，也就没在意。然后晚上准备休息的时候，大堂副理过来敲门，说给错钥匙了，给的两间都是套房，要换一间标房。换给我们的是朝北不带露台的房间，还说这个区域的客房统称景观房，不是一定带露台的。我们请携程交涉，才换到一间朝南的。这里的服务人员态度都好奇怪，餐厅没有人领位，清扫工自顾自抢在客人前面出门，早上8点多服务员敲门问可不可以整理房间（双休日唉，请勿打扰灯亮着没看见？），见到客人微笑问好是不要指望的。选这个宾馆一个原因是冲着锦江的牌子，相信管理、服务会比较到位吧，结果很失望，硬件硬，软件软。,"The environment is very good. It is considered a holiday resort. The room with a terrace and computer is very pleasant.The service is really average. When you go through the procedures, you can even give the key card wrong.We order a ordinary suite and a landscape standard room. It also specifies the landscape in the order in the standard room (this seems to be nonsense? The result proves that it is not abandoned at all).A terrace suite and a suite without terrace.The so -called suite is also one more mahjong room. Because we previously found that the hotel's own website reads ""the landscape room has an open -air balcony"". We thought that the northern room did not do the mahjong room without a terrace, so we didn't care.Then when I was about to rest at night, the deputy manager of the lobby came to knock on the door, saying that the key to the wrong key, the two of them were in a suit, and changed a tiger room.The room for us is the room without a terrace. It is also said that the guest rooms in this area are collectively referred to as landscape houses, which is not necessarily a terrace.We asked Ctrip to negotiate to change to a south.The attitude of the service staff here is strange. No one is led by the restaurant. The cleaning workers are stealing and snatching in front of the guests. At 8 o'clock in the morning, the waiter knocked on the door to ask if the room can be organized (double off, please do not disturb the light light and not see it?), I don't expect to see the guests smile and ask.One reason for choosing this hotel is to take the brand of Jinjiang. I believe that management and services will be in place. As a result, it is disappointed. The hardware is hard and the software is soft."
1,西楼海景房实际面对的是一片工地，正在施工，不过还好，不影响睡眠。免费升级到了一个家庭套房，有3张床。不过卫生间小点，尤其是台盆。酒店服务还是不错，热情。就是Checkout怎么到中午高峰时段只有一个人。酒店housekeeping也不会补拖鞋。,"The West Building Sea -view House actually faces a construction site and is under construction, but fortunately, it does not affect sleep.Free upgrade to a family suite with 3 beds.But the bathroom, especially the basin.The hotel service is still good and enthusiastic.It is only one person at noon peak time at noon.The hotel Housekeeping will not make up for slippers."
1,住的经济楼，房间大到超乎预想，还有单独的棋牌室。四星的装修和设施，酒店外观也颇有气势和特色，早餐很丰富。,"The economic building where the room lives is beyond expectations, and there is a separate chess and card room.The decoration and facilities of the four -star, the appearance of the hotel is quite imposing and unique, and the breakfast is rich."
0,较其他地方的莫泰，这家大床间面积很大，经济型酒店感觉莫泰比如家住的舒服。餐厅套餐28块，比较贵，如家才18,"Compared with Motai in other places, this large bed is very large, and the economy hotel feels that Mo Tai is comfortable as home.The restaurant package is 28 yuan, which is more expensive."
1,1、我原本是通过丽江某旅行社订房在香格里拉大道某酒店，到达酒店后，对酒店不甚满意。出租车司机向我推荐了古城里的“丽王酒店”、“王府饭店”、“和玺酒店”。对比三家酒店，和玺酒店更具有古朴特色，一个个院落组成，鸟语花香，令人陶醉。其它两个酒店都是大院。房间相对较差。遗憾的是到总一一咨询房价，打完折扣后还586元/标。但服务员很专业，服务态度很好，还向我推荐到携程网上预订价格是438元/标，还免费提供大堂吧电脑给我预订。最后住在23号院。非常安静，傍晚和第二清晨，花香味+鸟叫声+酒店播放的古筝音乐+丽江的碧空万里无云。构成了一幅十分美妙的立休画景。是我有生以来第一次享受到这样如诗如画的场景。2、来丽之前听说丽江好多酒店同比其它城市的酒店都比较弱，比较差。但住在这家酒店不觉得，还真让人耳目一新，独特风格的小院，礼貌热情的服务员，很不错。3、酒店很有特色，环境舒适，服务一流，漫步在院落中，到处都有服务员的微笑招呼，就像置身在自家大院里。到处是自己的亲人，特向去丽江的朋友们推荐该酒店。4、感觉不错，二层小楼，很干净，而且设施齐全，比有的五星感觉都好，酒店保安随处可见，很有安全感。5、酒店在古城里，环境，位置都不错，硬件条件都非常好。而且具有当地纳西族院落特色，各方面方便，值得一住。6、酒店全是木质结构建筑，很漂亮，干净清爽，服务人员从院落、保安亭、总台个个都是人性化服务，唯一不足就是餐厅相对较小。7、可惜有事要去香格里拉，要不还真不想离开，一直想住下去，真休闲。早餐按国际标准到10：00am。不足就是客房电视外语频道涉及较少。8、在订房时看到网上说酒店早餐很次，用餐下来不觉得呀，早餐种类很全，真是营养大餐。特别是牛奶，原汁原味，决不是用奶粉冲泡。跟本不像网上所说，不知还是酒店早餐已改进呢。,"1. I originally reached a hotel in a travel agency in Lijiang at a hotel in Shangri -La Avenue. After arriving at the hotel, I was not very satisfied with the hotel.The taxi driver recommended to me the ""Liwang Hotel"", ""Wangfu Hotel"", and ""Hexi Hotel"" in the ancient city.Compared with the three hotels, Hexi Hotel has more quaint characteristics. The courtyard is composed of one by one.The other two hotels are large courtyards.The room is relatively poor.Unfortunately, consult the house price one by one, and it will be 586 yuan/tab after the discount.However, the waiter is very professional and the service attitude is very good. I also recommend it to me to the online booking price of Ctrip 438 yuan/tab. It also provides a lobby bar for me for free.Finally lived in Courtyard 23.Very quiet. In the evening and the second morning, the fragrance+bird scream+the guzheng music played by the hotel+the blue air of Lijiang.It constitutes a very wonderful stand -up painting scene.It is the first time I have enjoyed such a picturesque scene for the first time.2. Lai Li heard that many hotels in Lijiang were weaker and worse than hotels in other cities year -on -year.But I do n’t think I live in this hotel. It is really refreshing, unique style courtyard, polite and enthusiastic waiters.3. The hotel is very distinctive, the environment is comfortable, the service is first -class, strolling in the courtyard, and the waiter smiled and greeted everywhere, just like being in his own courtyard.There are their relatives everywhere, and friends who have gone to Lijiang recommend the hotel.4. It feels good. The small building on the second floor is very clean, and the facilities are complete. It feels better than some five -star. The hotel security can be seen everywhere, which is very secure.5. The hotel is in the ancient city, the environment, location, and hardware conditions are very good.And it has the characteristics of the local Naxi courtyard, convenient in all aspects, and it is worth living.6. The hotel is full of wooden structures. It is very beautiful, clean and refreshing. The service personnel are humanized from courtyard, security pavilion, and the main station. The only disadvantage is that the restaurant is relatively small.7. Unfortunately, if you have something to go to Shangri -La, or you really don't want to leave, you always want to live, it's really casual.Breakfast is based on international standards until 10:00 am.The shortcomings are that the foreign language channel of the guest room involves less.8. When you order, you can see that the hotel breakfast is very good at the Internet. I don't feel it after dining. The type of breakfast is very complete. It is really a nutritious meal.Especially milk, authentic flavor, is by no means brewing with milk powder.It is not as mentioned on the Internet. I do n’t know if the hotel breakfast has improved."
1,性价比比较高。位置不错，挺幽静，不过作为5星酒店，就是早餐的内容少了点,"The cost performance is relatively high.The location is good, quite quiet, but as a 5 -star hotel, the content of breakfast is less content"
1,今天入住该酒店，正遇上一个上海公司在次开会，我参观了一下会场蛮好的，饭厅是通透的玻璃，餐厅蛮灵的，下次我们公司开会也准备放这酒店。酒店早餐过得去，房价底不能和五星级比啦，服务态度蛮好的，环境整洁，KTV设备也好装修蛮漂亮的。酒店房间整洁，房间内配备了电脑，才200多元一间，物有所值，很适合我们商务出差人事。,"I was staying at the hotel today. I was meeting a Shanghai company in the next meeting. I visited the venue. The dining room was transparent glass. The restaurant was gifted. Next time our company's meeting was also prepared to put this hotel.The hotel has a breakfast, and the house price cannot be compared with five -star. The service attitude is quite good, the environment is clean, and the KTV equipment is also good for decoration.The hotel room is neat, and the room is equipped with a computer, which is only 200 yuan. It is worth it, which is very suitable for our business businessmen."
1,酒店就是离市区太远。离新国际展会也不近。我的客人还算满意。,The hotel is too far from the city.It is not close to the New International Exhibition.My guests are quite satisfied.

1,"酒店地段较好,打的去淮海路也只要20元左右。只是门面很小，幸亏招牌字够大，否则打的从浦东机场沿浦东大道过来时差点找不到。房间设施新旧中规中矩，就是奇怪好象房间高度很低，因本人个子较高，总感觉要碰到房顶。第二天早上要退房时才发现进门的地方有个厨房，实际用处不大，在里面藏个人到是隐蔽。","The hotel location is better, and it only costs about 20 yuan to go to Huaihai Road.It ’s just that the facade is very small. Fortunately, the signboard is large enough, otherwise it would not be found when it came from Pudong Airport to Pudong Avenue.The old and new room facilities are quite satisfactory. It seems that the room height is very low. Because I am high, I always feel that I want to meet the roof.The next morning, I found that there was a kitchen where I entered the door. The actual use was not very useful."
1,大堂竟然没有电源插孔可以充电，服务还算可以，但是服务的意识还是有点欠缺。。。,"The lobby has no power jack to charge, and the service is okay, but the awareness of the service is still a bit lacking.EssenceEssence"
1,第一次入住宁丰宾馆，地处市中心，购物很方便。房间装修时尚、温馨，用品干净舒适，而且有鲜花和水果赠送，有家的感觉，服务热情周到。唯一不足的是门口修路，不过听说五一就可以修好。住后感言：同样的服务，他们更惊喜；同样的微笑，他们更真诚！,"The first time I stayed at Ningfeng Hotel, located in the center of the city, it was very convenient to shop.The room decoration is stylish, warm, clean and comfortable in the supplies, and it is given by flowers and fruits. It feels like home, and the service is warm and thoughtful.The only disadvantage is the road repair at the door, but I can repair it when I heard that May Day.Explanation after living: The same service, they are even more surprised; the same smile, they are more sincere!"
0,很一般的酒店……性价比一般……酒店是旧式房子，门感觉不太安全，洗手间相对来说还算装修的可以，只能算宾馆，不能称作酒店，隔音很差，环境很一般,Very ordinary hotels ... cost -effective ... The hotel is an old -fashioned house. The door feels not safe. The toilet is relatively decorated. It can only be counted as a hotel.
0,位置还比较好找，交通、娱乐、购物都比较方便，服务一般化，进门都没人理，房间太小了，隔音很差，早餐品种太少又不好吃，弄脏了一块小毛巾又不是洗不掉就让我陪10块钱，房费已经预付了，结帐时只需要退我押金就好了，结果等了将近半个小时，前台就一个人，对这个酒店很失望！,"The location is relatively easy to find. Traffic, entertainment, and shopping are more convenient. The service is generally available. No one is ignored in the door. The room is too small, the sound insulation is very poor, the breakfast varieties are too small and not delicious.If you ca n’t wash it, let me accompany you 10 yuan. The room fee has been paid in advance. It only needs to pay my deposit when checking out. As a result, after waiting for nearly half an hour, the front desk is alone, disappointed with this hotel!"
1,说真的房间的设施和质量只当内地的3星水平不到不过还是很清静早餐是免费的靠近金沙要走7-8分钟到新葡京要走20分钟总体来说还算OK我想这大概就是澳门比较老的酒店了比起其他大的酒店价格上还是有竞争力的,"Seriously, the facilities and quality of the room are only when the level of 3 stars in the Mainland is not reached, but it is still very quiet breakfast. It is free to walk near Sands for 7-8 minutes to go to Grand Lisboa for 20 minutes.Probably the older hotel in Macau is still competitive than other hotels."
0,"看了携程用户的评价才定的,但大失所望。位置较偏僻,的哥还不知道路.周围环境也遭。服务态度冷淡，好象不会笑。卫生间小只有淋浴，热水一打出来泛黄（好象铁锈的颜色），水龙头开了半天才好。大概是除夕的缘故吧，晚上送了盘饺子，味道先不论，在遭受了一系列意外状况后，这点还是蛮不错的，叫我哇凉哇凉的心暖了点！早餐是最要命的,种类少先不说,味道真叫人难以下咽(也可能不对我的胃口)。总之，下次绝对不会去住了.","After seeing the evaluation of Ctrip users, it was fixed, but it was disappointed.The position is more remote, and the brother does not know the road. The surrounding environment has also been suffered.The service attitude is cold, and it doesn't seem to laugh.The bathroom is only shower, and the hot water is yellowed (like the color of the rust), and the faucet is opened for a long time.It is probably the reason for New Year's Eve. I gave a plate of dumplings at night. The taste is not bad. After suffering a series of accidents, this is pretty good. I told me to warm my heart!Breakfast is the most terrible. If there are few types, don't say it, the taste is really difficult to swallow (maybe not to my appetite).In short, I will never live next time."
0,刚住过这里，感觉不好，房间味道太大，一股子霉味，房间各种设施都很陈旧，我所预订的大床间，却没有宽带，只能一个住在双人标间。因为去的时候较晚，所以有点饿，结果在房间找了半天，只找了一个空荡荡的摆设冰箱。这么老的酒店还不装修一下，估计不会有回头客。好的一点是环境不错，但在海南，像这种花园式的宾馆还是不少的，并不构成特色。如果有人到洋浦来，建议住在海景花园宾馆，四星级设计，在房间门口的走廊上就面向大海，整个是个花园式布局。如果要洗浴，可以打个三轮车去干充（音译），只有几公里的路程。价格也很公道，238元大床间。,"I just lived here, it feels bad, the room tastes too big, a mildew, and various facilities in the room are very old. In the large bed I reservation, there is no broadband, and I can only live in a double standard room.Because I went late, I was a little hungry. As a result, I found it in the room for a long time, and I only found an empty refrigerator.Such an old hotel is not decorated, and there will be no retorters.A good thing is that the environment is good, but in Hainan, there are still a lot of hotels like this garden -like hotel, which does not constitute characteristics.If someone comes to Yangpu, it is recommended to live in the Sea View Garden Hotel and four -star design. It is facing the sea in the corridor at the door of the room. The whole is a garden -style layout.If you want to take a bath, you can take a tricycle to dry the charge (transliteration), only a few kilometers.The price is also fair, 238 yuan big bed."
1,房间干净，洗澡水不错，服务挺热情，房价不高。环境不太好，周围比较脏。京沈高速上就有指示标志，容易找。停车方便。没车最好别去。,"The room is clean, the bath water is good, the service is very enthusiastic, and the house price is not high.The environment is not good, and the surroundings are dirty.There are indications on the Beijing -Shenzhen high speed, which is easy to find.Convenient parking.It is best not to go without a car."

1,酒店就在人民大街上，各方面感觉还算满意，不过长春同等价位应该还有更多更好的选择，酒店性价比不算高。,"The hotel is on people's streets. It feels satisfied in all aspects, but there should be more and better choices in Changchun. The cost performance of the hotel is not high."
1,预定的是商务大床房，房间和床都够大。但是空调的出风口对着床，即使开了微风还是有点冷。空调器固定在墙上的，只能走过去调节空调，不太方便。电视机有点小，而且也不是纯平的，算是缺陷了。其他都挺不错，整体房间很干净，设施也基本齐全。,"The booked big bedroom, room and bed are large enough.But the air outlet of the air conditioner is facing the bed, even if the breeze is turned on, it is a bit cold.The air conditioner is fixed on the wall, and it can only be used to adjust the air conditioner, which is not convenient.The TV is a bit small, and it is not pure, it is a defect.The others are pretty good, the overall room is very clean, and the facilities are basically complete."
1,酒店就在市中心，很醒目，而且比较干净，比一些大城市里面的四星级酒店要好一些，价格也比较诱人。,"The hotel is in the city center, very eye -catching, and relatively clean, better than four -star hotels in some big cities, and the price is more attractive."
1,地段还不错，从酒店走到市中心大约十五分钟，酒店还比较干净，就是我们被安排在一楼，有点潮湿，而且有蚊子，窗外就是一个住户家的院子，从早上六点起就一直在放收音机，严重影响睡眠~,"The location is not bad. It is about fifteen minutes from the hotel to the city center. The hotel is relatively clean, that is, we are arranged on the first floor. It is a bit humid and there are mosquitoes. Outside the window is a resident's yard. From 6 am in the morning, it has always been at 6 am.Putting the radio, which seriously affects sleep ~"
1,硬件设施不错，还有赠送的水果，早餐比较丰富，不足的是隔音效果差，晚上能清楚地听见隔壁的谈话声及嘿咻声~~,"The hardware facilities are good, and there are gifts given. The breakfast is relatively rich."
1,交通方便，餐厅饭菜不错，只是较小，忙时要预定。价格合理，下次还住这里！补充点评2008年4月11日：刷卡时国内卡刷不出来，到是国外的卡刷出来了。奇怪！,"Convenient transportation, good restaurant meals, just smaller, booking when busy.The price is reasonable, I will live here next time!Supplementary comment on April 11, 2008: Domestic cards could not be swiped when swiping the card, and it was a foreign card.strangeness!"
0,除了环境比较好，在云龙公园对面，酒店设施太旧了，价格高，性价比低，在这个天气，房间里竟然有好多蚊子，半夜被蚊子打扰几次,"In addition to the better environment, opposite Yunlong Park, the hotel facilities are too old, the price is high, and the cost performance is low. In this weather, there are a lot of mosquitoes in the room."

As a result, there was no air conditioner in this hotel. There was only one so -called ventilation. The windows were all died again.

1,酒店房间不错，就是价格偏高，餐饮很方便。就是距离市中心太远,"The hotel room is good, but the price is high and the catering is very convenient.It's too far from the city center"
1,非常好的一家酒店，服务很好。房间的设施也很好。比很多五星级的酒店也好。但是，外面比较难打的。并且，这边的的士，都不打表，去3公里的地方，他们开价30元，真是天价的士。虽然跟酒店没关，但希望酒店能到相关部门反映一下。,"A very good hotel with good service.The facilities in the room are also very good.It's better than many five -star hotels.However, it is more difficult to fight outside.In addition, the taxis here do not make a table. When they go to 3 kilometers, they will drive 30 yuan, which is really a price -like taxi.Although it has nothing to do with the hotel, I hope the hotel can be reflected in the relevant departments."
1,地段比较有优势，而且老外也住习惯了，每次都是这里。,"The location is relatively advantageous, and foreigners are also used to living habits, and they are here every time."
1,"有宽带接口,但没有电脑,多加的钱太不值了.另外,该酒店的水龙头流出的水太小了.","There is a broadband interface, but there is no computer, and the more money is too worthless. In addition, the water flowing from the hotel's faucet is too small."
0,"我们一家人带孩子去过“五.一”，在协程网上挑了半天才选中的酒店，但看来还是错了。1.酒店除了房间大和套间的格局没有其他可取，本来就不是为酒店设计的，但里面的家具又比北京上海的酒店式公寓落后和陈旧。2.从进接待厅(不能叫大堂)开始直到走道、房间都有一股味道，你们可以想象一下就是烟味、汗味、霉味混杂一起散不出去的味道。该楼为全封闭没有一扇窗户可以通风，全靠中央空调换风，这就是问题所在，我们住的当晚店方告诉冷热风没有只有自然风，强烈建议订房前问清除，要不真是受罪，晚上热的睡不着觉。3.浴巾毛巾真的很脏很旧.三星都不如.尤其是新换的枕套据然有股味,我以为服务员没换,要求重新更换,结果还是一样.看来是洗衣房有问题.4.游泳池是我们选他的重要原因,因为孩子正在学游泳.25米乘10米的小池子,显然没有水过滤系统,要不就是没开.水已经比较混了.游客全是当地的客人.淋浴间内除了水龙头没有任何用品提供.建议客人不要考虑5.餐厅没有尝试,(协程总是贪污我们的早餐.我在协程订的房几乎没吃过免费早餐)所以没有评价6.唯一值得表扬的是服务人员反映还算快,有投诉能马上过来解释,他们能做的也只有解释,硬件的问题他们解决不了.","Our family took the children to the ""five. One"" and picked the hotel for a long time on the coroutine.1. There is nothing other than the style of the hotel in the room. It was not designed for the hotel, but the furniture inside was backward and old than the hotel -style apartment in Beijing and Shanghai.2. From entering the reception hall (cannot call the lobby) until the aisle and the room have a taste. You can imagine the smell of smoke, sweat, and mildew.There is no window to ventilate the building in order to be fully closed. It depends on the central air -conditioning to change the wind. This is the problem. The shop where we lived on the night told the cold and heat air., I ca n’t sleep hot at night.3. Towel towels are really dirty and old. Samsung is not as good as. Especially the newly replaced pillow cover has a taste. I thought the waiter did not change it and asked to replace it again. The result is still the same. 4. The swimming pool is an important reason we choose him, because the child is learning to swim. 25 meters by 10 meters. Obviously there is no water filtering system, or it is not open. The water is already mixed. The tourists are all local guests.There is no supplies for the faucet in the shower room. It is recommended that guests do not consider 5. The restaurant has not tried, (the corporate is always corrupted our breakfast. I have hardly eaten free breakfast in the booked house in the coroutine) So there is no evaluation 6. The only oneIt is worthy of praise that the service staff reflected it fast. Some complaints can come over and explain immediately. What they can do is to explain. They cannot solve the problem of hardware. They cannot solve it."
1,酒店环境不错，房间也挺干净，距离千岛湖广场也很近！就是牙刷质量不怎么样，一刷毛都掉下来了，满嘴巴的毛！早餐的酱瓜很好吃！,"The hotel environment is good, the room is very clean, and it is very close to Qiandao Lake Plaza!That is, the quality of the toothbrush is not good, and the bristles have fallen, and the mouth is full of hair!Breakfast sauce is delicious!"

1,"地理位子不错.房间也不错.早餐很丰富.开始给了我间拐角的房间,很小.还好我经常住这家酒店,知道这房间的大小所以叫前台换了.所以感觉这酒店还是有点欺负老实人的感觉.大家一定要多多注意.","The geographical seat is good. The room is also good. The breakfast is very rich.

1,酒店是相当的不错，房间面积不大不小，关键是我喜欢它装修风格的雅致。我把携程在保定的宾馆都住一遍了，可以负责任的说，亨通财富是个不错的选择。,"The hotel is quite good, and the room area is not small. The key is that I like the elegant decoration style.I have lived in Ctrip's hotels in Baoding. I can say responsible that Hengtong Wealth is a good choice."

0,住的标准单人间实在是小，房间里一张大床已经塞得满满的了，设施极其简陋除了电视机和烧水壶其他什么都没有，说是四星级标准实际还达不到中等三星级的水平。最差的是酒店临街，大堂居然有三个门而且只有正门有人看，测门对着酒店电梯任人自出自如，半夜三更也不上锁，安全太差。,The standard single room for living is really small. A large bed in the room has been stuffed. The facilities are extremely simple except for the TV and the kettle.Level level.The worst is that the hotel is near the street.

1,一个人入住对于600元的价格觉得有点奢侈，但是环境还可以，比预想的好，也比较干净。水量很充足，床上用品据服务员讲是每日更换，听说山上的水48元|吨，对于等黄山的疲惫感来说，能好好的洗个热水澡，惬意的睡眠时非常重要的，总的来说还是很好的。,"A person is a bit luxurious for the price of 600 yuan, but the environment is okay, which is better than expected.The amount of water is sufficient.

For the fatigue of Huangshan, you can take a hot bath well.Overall is still very good."
1,酒店位置非常不错，而且是酒店式的，很像一个大的别墅区，大家住的房间在不同的别墅，感觉很好，有家的感觉，没有酒店那种压抑感。唯一的缺点就是酒店用的是卫星电视，不是有线电视，所以电视台不多。由于没有CCTV5我夜里没看成球赛。呵呵,"The hotel location is very good, and it is hotel -style. It looks like a large villa area. The room where everyone lives is in different villas. It feels good. It feels like home. There is no sense of depression of a hotel.The only disadvantage is that the hotel uses satellite TV, not a cable TV, so there are not many TV stations.Since I did n’t have CCTV5, I did n’t watch the game at night.hehe"
0,对这家店及为期3天的入住，我只能说：太差、实在太差！后悔、非常后悔！位置非常不方便，前台服务极差，17日中午结账退房也要排队（就一个人值班），开发票写错抬头还不情愿给我换，我不知道是不是其他如家也是这样。携程对这家店应该负责任的调查一下。补充点评2008年5月18日：岂止是“安静”，“安静”到每天一早六、七点就被大声呼朋唤友的人吵醒，也不见酒店提醒他们注意。好不容易再睡下，刚到八点就被服务员挨个的敲门声（说是要打扫房间）再次弄醒，郁闷到极点！到负一楼餐厅才被告知必须上一楼前台买早餐券才可以用餐，还不给多买两天的，差点跟他们急，才告诉我要买也可以，就是不能退票！真是岂有此理！,"I can only say that this store and 3 -day check -in, too bad, too bad!Regret and regret it!The location is very inconvenient.

1,庐山上的最老的酒店之一，在山上性价比还不错。这次没有通过携程预订酒店就前往庐山了，首先自己到全国人大宾馆，房不错，风景很好，可是标间要800块，太贵了，然后自己到国脉宾馆，460最低，但只有一间房，房也还可以，就是没有风景可看，而且我要两间房，没办法了。然后通过携程电话预定了太极宾馆，260元/间，到了一看，天啊，这也叫宾馆！太烂了。赶快再让携程退掉，换了庐山宾馆，380元/间，有房，大堂像县城招待所，都是木头做的楼梯和墙，低矮潮湿，不过房间还好，很大，有3星级标准，而且阳台非常大，并且封起来了，相当于套房。洗手间全套科勒洁具，房间有无线上网，信号还可以。这次住的209房是周总理住过的，房间里有照片，房间在宾馆转角，有180度的玻璃，风景不错。房费不含早餐，自助早餐15元/人，难吃得很。也在宾馆餐厅吃了晚饭，也难吃得要命，什么石鸡、石鱼、石耳都难吃得很，而且奇贵无比，4个人吃了五百块，还不如在山下95元吃的中餐。大家如果入住，绝对不要在宾馆吃，山上主街道的其他饭店都还不错啦。很多都把菜谱价格写在门口。总体来说，除了餐饮，这家宾馆在山上还算满意啦。庐山风景很好，而且允许自己开车上山，很难得，值得一去。,"One of the oldest hotels on Lushan is cost -effective on the mountain.I went to Lushan without booking a hotel through Ctrip. First of all, I went to the National People's Congress Hotel. The room was good and the scenery was very good, but the standard room was 800 yuan, which was too expensive. Then I went to the National Mai Hotel.In the room, the room is okay, but there is no scenery to see, and I want two rooms, there is no way.Then I booked Tai Chi Hotel through Ctrip phone, 260 yuan/room. At first glance, God, this is also called hotel!Too rotten.Hurry up and let Ctrip retreat, change the Lushan Hotel, 380 yuan/room, there are rooms. The lobby is like a county hospitality house.Standards, and the balcony is very large, and it is sealed, equivalent to suite.A full set of Kohler sanitary ware, the room is wireless Internet, and the signal is okay.Room 209 this time was lived by Premier Zhou. There were photos in the room. The room was in the corner of the hotel. There were 180 degrees of glass. The scenery was good.House fees do not include breakfast, buffet breakfast 15 yuan/person, very unpalatable.I also ate dinner in the hotel and restaurant, and it was terrible. Whatever stone chicken, stone fish, and stone ear were very unpalatable, and they were extremely expensive. Four people ate 500 yuan.Chinese food.If you stay in, you must not eat in the hotel. Other restaurants on the main streets on the mountain are pretty good.Many of the recipes are written at the door.Overall, in addition to catering, this hotel is quite satisfied with the mountain.The Lushan scenery is very good, and it is rare to allow you to drive up the mountain."

1,因为“五一”期间宜昌的房比较紧，只订到了贵宾房。酒店位置还算可以。离火车站和夷陵广场不算远，行李不多的话，从火车站走路或者坐几站公交车到长江医院下车就到了。能看出酒店比较老了（89年开业），卫生间的地面上有擦不掉的霉斑，卫生间外面的墙壁上也有水浸泡的痕迹，而且毛巾、电梯等（电梯里没有看到检验证）也比较旧。而且是中央空调，不能自己调节温度，当把风量改成弱的时候噪音大了些。不过服务业有个特点，就是优秀的服务能弥补硬件的不足，而反过来却不行，平湖大酒店的服务就不错，和我之后在武汉住的欧美经典（2007年开业）形成鲜明对比。入住的时候前台有群客人在询问房间，酒店已经没有房了，幸亏是提前通过携程订好了房间。入住手续很快办好了，在房间里发现有一封以自己姓名为抬头的欢迎信，头一个感觉就不错。向客房部要网线，服务员很快就送过来了，而且回答问题也很有礼貌、对当时不知道的问题随后也补充回答了。自助早餐品种挺丰富，对早餐是非常满意。不过同时用餐的客人的素质实在不敢恭维，离店那天用早餐时，不知道是哪个团的客人（后来发现也同乘早上去汉口的火车），大呼小叫，还有人竟然用自己的筷子（而不是公用的夹子）把菜从自选餐盘里夹起来直接就往嘴里送！什么素质啊！再饿也不至于这样吧？别人还怎么吃啊？可惜入住的时候一楼的RioGrande墨西哥餐厅正在装修，要不还真想品尝一下宜昌做的墨西哥菜。前台的服务态度虽然不能说非常热情，但是速度是一流的，不管是入住、延住、换钱还是退房，办理得都很快。仅就硬件来讲，280元/夜的房价我觉得不是很值，但这里的服务是够得上三星级水平的，280元不算亏。,"Because Yichang's room was relatively tight during the ""May 1st"" period, he only booked a VIP room.The hotel location is okay.It is not far from the railway station and Yiling Plaza. If there are not many luggage, you will get from the train station or take a few buses to the Yangtze River Hospital to get off the bus.It can be seen that the hotel is older (opened in 1989). There are mildew spots on the ground of the bathroom. There are also traces of water soaking on the walls outside the bathroom, and towels, elevators, etc. (no inspection verification is seen in the elevator)Also older.And it is a central air conditioner. You cannot adjust the temperature by yourself. When the air volume is changed to weak, the noise is greater.However, the service industry has a characteristic that excellent services can make up for the lack of hardware, but in turn, it is not good. The service of the Pinghu Hotel is good. It is in sharp contrast to the European and American classics (opened in 2007) where I live in Wuhan.At the time of check -in, there were group guests in the front desk asking the room. The hotel had no room. Fortunately, the room was booked through Ctrip in advance.The check -in procedure was quickly completed. In the room, I found a welcome letter based on my own name, and the first feeling was good.Ask the guest room to ask the room line, the waiter quickly sent it, and the answer was very polite, and the questions that I didn't know at the time were then answered.The buffet breakfast varieties are very rich and are very satisfied with breakfast.However, the quality of the guests who dine at the same time did not dare to compliment. On the day of breakfast from the store, I did n’t know which group of the guests (later found that they also took the train to Hankou in the morning), shouted, and some people even used their own use of their own own.Chopsticks (instead of public clip) Put the dishes from the selected dish and send it directly into the mouth!What quality!Isn't this so hungry?How else do you eat?Unfortunately, the RioGrande Mexican restaurant on the first floor was renovated on the first floor. Otherwise, I really wanted to taste Mexican cuisine made by Yichang.Although the service attitude of the front desk cannot be said to be very enthusiastic, the speed is first -class. Whether it is check -in, delay, change money, or check out, it is very fast.In terms of hardware, I don't think it is worth the house price of 280 yuan/night, but the service here is enough to reach the three -star level. 280 yuan is not a loss."
1,记得，一定要拔掉电话线，那些争取按摩业绩的小姐很有毅力，很晚都会打电话开发可能性，别以为已经打过就不会再被骚扰。,"Remember, you must unplug the phone line. Those ladies who fight for massage performance are very perseverance. They will call the possibility of development late. Don't think that they will not be harassed again."
1,房间旧了一点，床硬，隔音较差，房间里和走廊的灯光都太暗。睡衣有霉味。房间有点压抑的感觉想了半天觉得是天花太矮。灯光不太好控制。,"The room is a bit old, the bed is hard, the sound insulation is poor, and the lights in the room and the corridor are too dark.Pajamas have a moldy smell.The room was a bit depressed and felt that it was too short for a long time.The lights are not easy to control."
1,王府是值得推荐的酒店，因为：1、保安及饭店的其他员工服务态度很好，对宾客非常有礼貌，还有免费送机等项目。2、自助早餐是开到下午一点半，而且还很丰富。3、每天有免费的水果和热牛奶送上。4、最主要的是房间超大，卫生间超大，床超大，干净。补充点评2008年6月16日：我是2008年6月7日开始在王府住了3个晚上,"Wangfu is a recommended hotel, because: 1. The service attitude of other employees in the security guards and restaurants is very polite to guests, as well as free delivery and other items.2. The buffet breakfast is opened until 1:30 in the afternoon, and it is very rich.3. Send free fruits and hot milk every day.4. The most important thing is that the room is large, the bathroom is large, the bed is large, and it is clean.Supplementary comment on June 16, 2008: I lived in Wangfu for 3 nights in Wangfu on June 7, 2008"
1,"其我很喜大宗酒店的洲式,外和也很美,次已是第2次入住,感也是很不,服很有貌,如果上可以提供多更好,因我得那次入住是840多元,含早,次是750,不含早,其不是差太,但我比喜那次入住的房,如果可以提供不同的房就好了,有被子只有羽被,我比喜棉被,羽被太了..哈,我相信我下次也入住,","I like the continental style of the big hotel.Diversity, early, the second is 750, no early, it is not too bad, but I can provide different rooms than the house that I stay in that time. There are only a quilt.Yu was too .. Ha, I believe I will stay in the next time,"
0,10月1－3日入住，该酒店环境很差，像个大杂院。里面有消防队，小店，居民搂等。房间设施也一般，毛巾更是又黑又硬，插地还差不多。更可怕的是3日凌晨小偷竟两次光顾我的房间，而且有钥匙打开房门，幸亏我上了防盗链，没有进来。事后酒店方面承认防盗压力很大，而且屡有客人失窃。我建议携程可考虑推荐这种酒店。补充点评2007年10月11日：应为：建议携程考虑取消推荐该酒店。,"Staying from October 1st to 3rd, the hotel's environment was very poor, like a big courtyard.There are fire brigade, small shops, residents, etc.The room facilities are also average, the towels are dark and hard, and the land is almost the same.What is even more terrible is that the thief in the early morning of the 3rd patronized my room twice, and there was a key to open the door. Fortunately, I went to the anti -theft chain and did not come in.Afterwards, the hotel acknowledged that the anti -theft pressure was great, and there were repeated guests that were stolen.I suggest that Ctrip can consider recommending this hotel.Supplementary comment on October 11, 2007: It should be: Ctrip should consider canceling the recommended hotel."
1,在这个酒店住过至少有四次，进行一下简单的评价：房间的面积比较大，够得上四星的标准，只是有些房间稍旧了点；房间的设施中规中矩，还行，电脑的上网速度还可以；卫生间的花瓣很欣赏，这一点相当不错；客房服务员的态度非常好，很欣赏；总体感觉较好，推荐！！！,"There are at least four times in this hotel, and a simple evaluation is made: the area of the room is relatively large, which can be enough for the four -star standard, but some rooms are a little old;It is okay; the petals of the bathroom are very appreciated, which is quite good; the attitude of the guest room waiter is very good and appreciates; the overall feels good, recommended!IntersectionIntersection"
1,不太能带来惊喜的一家酒店，也没什么特别批评的地方。作为一家三星级的酒店，也算够格了。位置确实很好，紧邻解放碑，酒店隔壁就是新世纪百货，但酒店的房间里却一点不吵，很有闹中取静的感觉。早餐也还过得去，酒店的整体服务都还过得去。入住期间还有免费市话和长话可以享用，另外酒店推出的还有租用小灵通的业务（￥10/天，长途、市话任打）也很人性化。房间内配置的电脑也还不错（我订的是套房），网速还挺快。不过需要批评的是房间内的沙发实在太龌龊了，白色的沙发套都近乎灰黑色了，坐在上面我都觉得难过。我们家养了三猫一狗，沙发都没有这么埋汰啊！,"A hotel that is not very surprising has nothing specially criticized.As a three -star hotel, it is enough.The location is really good. It is close to the Jiefangbei. The next door of the hotel is the new century department store, but the hotel's room is not noisy at all, and it feels very quiet.Breakfast is still available, and the overall service of the hotel is still available.During the staying period, there are also free markets and long dialects to enjoy. In addition, the hotel also launched a small Lingtong business (￥ 10/day, long -distance and market -speaking) is also very humane.The computer configured in the room is also good (I booked a suite), and the network speed is quite fast.However, what needs to be criticized is that the sofa in the room is too stunned. The white sofa covers are almost gray and black, and I feel sad when I sit on it.Our family raised three cats and dogs, and the sofa was not so buried!"
0,我住的是6号房，无窗，像住地下室；而且因此酒店地处繁华地段经营业务也很多，电梯里遇见的人很杂！总的来说住宿环境很不舒服！房价在携程预定也没有得到任何优惠，不预定直接入住也一样是那个价格，其他房间的环境不知道，不好乱说。但建议，大家一定要问清楚。自己的要求。省得后悔！,"I live in Room 6, with no windows, like living in the basement; therefore, the hotel is located in a bustling area.In general, the accommodation environment is very uncomfortable!House prices have not received any discounts in Ctrip's reservation. It is the same price without reservation. The environment of other rooms is not known. It is not easy to talk about it.But it is recommended that everyone must ask clearly.Your own requirements.Save regret!"
1,"我住的豪华房,被子太厚,晚上睡觉超热,前台小姐服务态度一般,没见到笑脸.宾馆服务较好.","The luxurious room I live in, the quilt is too thick, the quilt is too hot at night, the service attitude of the front desk lady is average, I do n’t see a smiley face. The hotel service is better."
1,"碰上会议期间很不容易才订上房间,很干净,玻璃隔断,条件是不错的,但价格贵得没道理,与平时差异太大.携程应该要求有比较好的价格政策的","During the meeting, it was not easy to order the room. It was clean, glass partition, and the conditions were good, but the price was too expensive, and the difference was too large. Ctrip should ask for a better price policy."
1,可能是因为周围修路，所以人比较少，环境很好很安静我入住的是标间的大床房间暖风很充足，浴室比较好，很大，水温不错房间很干净，空间大，房高，床也很舒适，也没有骚扰电话唯一缺点就是电视太小。。,"It may be because of the surrounding roads, so there are relatively few people, the environment is very good and quiet. I stay in the big bed room in the standard room. The warm wind is sufficient, the bathroom is better, very large.The bed is also very comfortable, and the only disadvantage of harassing calls is that the TV is too small.Essence"
0,如果你在考虑住这家酒店、那你就似乎在开始一个错误的选择！房间卫生较差、睡床就象睡在钢咝上一样、杂乱的环境！早攴差的无法描述、、看起很不卫生。印象很深的是一个农民工样的中年男子穿着普通便装在小小的攴厅中穿来走去！个人卫生不愿多讲、对每一个进来的人问你吃早攴吗？所有的人都不知所措、、、、、、恐怕都在想；我吃不吃早攴关你什么事？然后他就大声的说：早攴票！！！,"If you are considering living in this hotel, then you seem to start a wrong choice!The room is poor, and the bed is like sleeping on a steel cricket, a messy environment!Early poorly cannot describe, and it looks very unhygienic.What impressed him was that a migrant worker -like middle -aged man wore ordinary people in a small hall and walked around!Personal hygiene is unwilling to talk more, and ask everyone who comes in? Do you ask you to eat early?Everyone is at a loss, I am afraid that I am thinking about it; what's the matter with you?Then he said loudly: Early ticket!IntersectionIntersection"
1,"很不错的一家酒店,在当地来说是最好的了.客房设施在此价位相当到位,早餐口味及品种也很好,尤其是酒店的氛围绝对是优于临海其它酒店,感觉很好.补充点评2008年7月9日：很不错的一家酒店,在当地来说是最好的了.客房设施在此价位相当到位,早餐口味及品种也很好,尤其是酒店的氛围绝对是优于临海其它酒店,感觉很好.","A very good hotel is the best in the local area.

0,地理位置还算不错，就在北京电视台培训中心的边上，离海边非常的近，但是房间实在是太差劲了，是一个整栋别墅楼里分别出来的小间，普通标间小得可怜，挺多有十三四平米，摆两张床已无下脚的地方了，携程的价格倒算是便宜，服务态度还算可以，可是服务员的动作是非常慢的，入住结帐手续基本上都在二十分钟左右一单，如果不是挑剔的话还,"The geographical location is pretty good. It is on the side of the training center of Beijing TV Station. It is very close to the seaside, but the room is too bad. It is a small room in the whole villa building.There are a lot of thirteen or four square meters, and there are no places to set two beds. The price of Ctrip is cheap, and the service attitude is okay, but the waiter's actions are very slow.A single order in about ten minutes, if it is not picky"
0,"入住前询问态度还不错,但是朋友说房间莲蓬头水很小,还漏水,吵的睡不著,隔天要求退房,也许是不同服务人员,态度很差","The attitude was not bad before check -in, but my friend said that the shower head of the room was small, and the water was leaked. I couldn't sleep noisy. The next day was required to check out. Maybe it was a different service staff. The attitude was very poor."
1,"酒店的地理位置不错,面对员当湖,这次住了个01号房,有两面的窗户,一边可以看海一边可以看员当湖,尤其是员当湖的夜景,很漂亮.房间的设施有些旧了,毕竟是99年开业的,不过房间里有免费水果和免费矿泉水；大门口的LED电子屏幕很是惹眼，漂亮得很；6F的健身房和游泳池对住店客人免费开放。员工的素质和服务很不错,从进酒店大门就有门童向你问候,总台和客房的服务员都也很热情,退房时宾客关系主任还主动来询问住店的感受，征求意见，感觉很听客户关系主任说年底要装修,期待ing......房间价格包含的早餐很丰盛,品种很多，口味也都挺好的。400多块钱挺值的，我加了20块钱选了个每天“180分钟国内长话随意煲”的优惠，打了很久也才20块，直拨的，比IP电话还便宜，省了好多国内长话费！入住的时候正好有人办婚宴，大堂人来人往，很热闹，听说有几十桌的客人呢。下次还选这家入住！","The hotel's geographical location is good. Faced with the lake, this time I lived in Room 01, with two -sided windows. On the one hand, you can see the sea. You can see the lake, especially the night view of the lake.The facilities are a little old, after all, it opened in 1999, but there are free fruits and free mineral water in the room; the LED electronic screen at the gate is very eye -catching and beautiful; 6F gym and swimming pools are free to open the shoprs.The quality and service of the employees are very good. From the entrance of the hotel, there is a child to greet you. The waiters of the main station and the guest room are also very enthusiastic.

The room price contains a rich breakfast, a lot of varieties, and the taste is also good.More than 400 yuan is very worthy. I added 20 yuan to choose a discount for ""180 minutes of domestic long words and casual pots"". After a long time, it was only 20 yuan.Domestic long -term calls!When I stayed, someone had a wedding banquet. The lobby came and went, which was very lively. I heard that there were dozens of table guests.I will choose this check -in next time!"
0,这个酒店是我去过的连锁酒店服务最差的一个，其原因是变相拒绝携程客户，明明有房间可以预定，一听说是要通过携程预定，立马变脸，就告诉你没有特价房间了，如果不通过携程，可以给我打折20元，看见我坚持要通过携程预定，就不怎么搭理人了。携程的客服通过我手机向前台提出可以先办理手续让我入住，前台人员白眼一翻，然后告诉我，既然你要携程积分，那你慢慢等携程给我传真好了。我在大厅大概等了30分钟，然后才办理好房间。进了房间，立马就发现窗户上有一个蟑螂，当时觉得特别恶心（8901房间），打开电脑准备上网，发现网线的水晶头两侧都是坏的，只要稍微移动一下电脑就可能断网。由于该酒店离我客户的办公室非常近，我想就凑合2天吧，后来又发现该房间的打扫基本需要你通过电话通知，不通知不打扫，这也可以凑合，到了晚上睡觉的时候，这才发现房屋玻璃根本不隔音，由于靠近51大道（火车站出来的一条大街）晚上车辆非常频繁，根本不肯定达到安静程度，好不容易看完欧洲杯后，大清早就被楼下的车辆闹醒，这时候又发现窗帘原来是绝对不可能关严实，有一个较大的缝隙，针对早起的同志特别方便（5点天亮的时候可以自动提醒）！其实附近有一个如家快捷酒店的，但是但是我因为看见才装修完，估计味道还没有消除，就在这个酒店凑合了几个晚上，希望其他的朋友如果到了长沙，最好选择其他酒店。,"This hotel is the worst service chain hotel I have been to. The reason is that they reject Ctrip customers in disguise. Obviously there is a room to book. When I heard that I want to book through Ctrip, I immediately change my face and tell you that there is no special room. IfWithout Ctrip, I can discount me for 20 yuan. When I see that I insist on reservation through Ctrip, I don't care much about it.Ctrip's customer service was proposed to the front desk through my mobile phone. I can go through the procedures for me. The front desk staff turned around and told me that since you want to Ctrip points, then you slowly wait for Ctrip to show me the truth.I waited in the lobby for about 30 minutes before applying for the room.After entering the room, I immediately found that there was a cockroach on the window. At that time, I felt particularly disgusting (room 8901). I turned on the computer and prepared to access the Internet. I found that the sides of the crystal head of the network cable were bad.Since the hotel is very close to my customer's office, I want to make up for 2 days. Later, I found that the cleaning of the room basically requires you to notify you by phone.I found out that the glass of the house was not sounded at all. Because the vehicles were very frequent at night near 51 Avenue (a street from the train station), the vehicles were very frequent at night, and they were not sure to reach the degree of quiet. After reading the European CupAt this time, it was found that the curtains were absolutely impossible. There was a large gap. It was particularly convenient for comrades who got up early (it can be reminded automatically when it is on the day)!In fact, there is a home express hotel nearby, but because I saw it after seeing it, it is estimated that the taste has not been eliminated. I just got together for a few nights at this hotel. I hope other friends will choose other hotels if they arrive in Changsha."
0,退房时，前台服务员态度极差；我同事想办如家会员卡，收了40员之后还冷嘲热讽补充点评2008年8月7日：6月份入住如家快捷酒店（石家庄大石桥店），因同事与服务员发生了点不愉快，就在点评时说了自己的想法。让我没有想到的是，酒店领导对此非常重视，对此事做了及时处理，并多次给我电话表示歉意，征询意见。我和同事都非常感动；同事们都说：出差就住如家。我也希望如家越办越好！宾馆反馈2008年8月14日：感谢李先生一直以来对如家的支持，感谢您对大石桥店提出的宝贵建议，希望您能一如既往支持大石桥店，并监督我们的服务质量。再次感谢！,"When checking out, the front desk waiter has a poor attitude; my colleagues want to do a family membership card, and after receiving 40 members, I also ridiculed and replenished the comments on August 7, 2008: June to stay in Rujia Express Hotel (Shijiazhuang Dashiqiao Store).The waiter was unhappy, and he said his thoughts during the comment.What I didn't expect was that the hotel leaders attached great importance to this, dealt with this matter in a timely manner, and repeatedly apologized for me and asked for opinions.My colleagues and I were very moved; my colleagues said: I live in home if they are on a business trip.I also hope that Rujia will get better and better!Hotel feedback on August 14, 2008: Thanks to Mr. Li's support for Rujia, thank you for your precious suggestions on Dashiqiao Store.

0,内部管理太差，客房服务员监守自盗，然后赖到客户头上，已经两次了，一次是扑克牌，一次是洗发水。,"The internal management is too poor. The guest room waiter adheres to the stealing, and then depends on the customer. It has been twice, once it is a poker card, and the shampoo is once."

It was too late to pick the oranges and came back. I temporarily decided to live here, because it was only at their doorstep to book through Ctrip.When I confirmed by Ctrip's phone, I helped us check in first. I feel that the service is not bad. It is determined that their non -lake scenic house is large. The room is large. The bed is 2mx2m. The facilities are quite complete.When you live, the occupancy rate of the suite does not seem to be very high. It is worth recommending that several of the large terraces in their family can see Taihu Lake, a Chinese restaurant that can see the bridge.The scenery, the overall feeling is still very good.

1,应该算是阳朔最好的酒店了，在西街头上，距离汽车站又近，地段没的说了。而且要过一个桥在到酒店里面，闹重取静，也是一大亮点。不过阳朔毕竟是小地方，酒店房间设施应该达不到四星级的标准。,"It should be regarded as the best hotel in Yangshuo. On the streets of West, it is closer to the bus station.And it is a highlight to pass a bridge in the hotel, and it is also a highlight.However, after all, Yangshuo is a small place, and the hotel room facilities should not meet the four -star standard."

1,如果要品尝三亚的海鲜，住金凤凰是不错的选择。酒店离春园海鲜广场步行20分钟，打车10块钱，在三亚吃海鲜一定要去的。另外，在酒店的对面有一家模仿春园的叫做“春远海鲜”的地方，偶因为不喜欢这种可以仿造名牌的做法，没去。去滨海渔村走路只要5分钟就到了，也是吃海鲜的一个不错的去处。,"If you want to taste Sanya's seafood, it is a good choice to live in the golden phoenix.The hotel walks for 20 minutes from Chunyuan Seafood Plaza, takes 10 yuan for a taxi, and you must go to eat seafood in Sanya.In addition, there is a place called ""Chunyuan Seafood"" in the opposite side of the hotel. I did n’t go because I do n’t like this method that can imitate brand names because I do n’t like this method that can imitate brand names.It takes only 5 minutes to walk to Binhai Fishing Village, and it is also a good place to eat seafood."
1,有按摩浴缸和桑拿房的标准大床间很有特色4百的放假宽带免费含单早也算是值了。下次去还会入住再次感受下免费按摩浴缸和桑拿房：）,"The standard large bed with a massage bath and sauna room is very special for free. It is worth it.Next time you go, you will stay in the free massage bath and sauna again when you go in again :)"
0,优点：1、床很舒服，软硬适中。2、房间比较干净。3、景观可以。4、地区方便，周围有超市、酒楼。缺点：1、房间太小，走道不足80CM。2、浴室、厕所很臭，难以忍受，估计是排水道没搞好，一股沼气味。3、前台服务一般，不让我信用卡预付托收，要我一次性结账，非常奇怪。4、装修过于简陋，性价比不高，这酒店应该属300元内的等级。总体来说，如果不是迫不得已为了去北京大学方便，我是不会再次入住这酒店的。,"Advantages: 1.

The region is convenient, and there are supermarkets and restaurants around.Disadvantages: 1. The room is too small and the aisle is less than 80cm.2. The bathroom and toilet are stinky and unbearable. It is estimated that the drainage channel is not done well, and a biogas smell.3. The front desk service is average. It is strange that I will not allow me to pay for the credit card prepaid.4. The decoration is too rude and the cost performance is not high. This hotel should be a level within 300 yuan.Overall, if it is not for the convenience of going to Peking University, I will not stay in this hotel again."
0,酒店位置在火车站对面，汽车客运站就在附近。但早餐很差，而且房间比较旧，酒店为了省电，连走廊的电灯都经常关掉，出入不方便，不适合商务会客。,"The hotel is located across the railway station, and the car passenger station is nearby.However, breakfast is very poor, and the room is relatively old. In order to save power, the hotel's electric lights in the corridor are often turned off. It is not convenient to enter and exit. It is not suitable for business conferences."
1,酒店住过很多，唯有木棉花酒店的服务感觉最好，住了几次之后，前台就不需要证件和预授权了，每次checkin时，只要签字就好，很方便快捷，有时还像朋友一样聊上几句，感觉很好；房间比较干净、简洁；建议酒店方面去尝试一下绍兴开元名都酒店的超级舒服的床垫，正如广告说的“试一下，就知道是我想要的”。宾馆反馈2008年6月22日：非常感谢您对我们酒店服务的认可及支持，也感谢您给我们提供的宝贵信息，有你们的支持与共同关注，相信我们会做得越来越好的，同时也期待您的再一次光临，谢谢！,"The hotel has lived a lot. The only time for Kapok Hotel is the best. After living a few times, the front desk does not require documents and pre -authorization. Every time you checkin, just sign it, it is convenient and fast, and sometimes it looks like a friend.It feels good to talk about a few words; the room is relatively clean and concise; it is recommended that the hotel try to try the super comfortable mattress of the Shaoxing Kaiyuan Hotel.EssenceHotel feedback on June 22, 2008: Thank you very much for your recognition and support for our hotel service, and thank you for your valuable information. With your support and common attention, I believe we will do better and better.I also look forward to your visit again, thank you!"
0,房间价格奇贵，上网费2元每分钟，所有价格还要另加服务费。房间设施一般，电视信号时断时续。礼宾部最烂，免费的机场巴士好像是对客人的赏赐，坐了后觉得很不舒服。这家酒店我以后是绝对不会去了，其他华美达也都免了。,"The price of the room is expensive, and the online fee is 2 yuan per minute. All the price will be added to the service fee.The room facilities are average, and the TV signal is intermittent.The ritual department is the worst. The free airport bus seems to be a reward for guests. After sitting, I feel uncomfortable.I will never go in this hotel in the future, and other Huameda will be exempted."
1,位置、设施都不错，价格也还可以，就是隔音太差了，被隔壁吵了一晚上,"The location and facilities are good, and the price is okay, that is, the sound insulation is too bad, and I was quarreled all night by the next door."
1,前台有点傻，可能是新人吧！早餐没吃上，不敢乱评。感觉比水晶宫好。推荐入住。补充点评2007年10月18日：另，一楼翠亨粤菜点评：干炒牛河太湿，蒸凤爪不入味，这两个点心一吃就知不怎么正宗，粤菜馆连点心都做不好，还混什么？凤爪都搞不好的还卖鲍鱼！谁敢买？,"The front desk is a bit stupid, maybe it is a newcomer!I did n’t eat breakfast, I dare not comment randomly.It feels better than Crystal Palace.Recommended stay.Supplementary comment on October 18, 2007: In addition, Cuiheng Cantonese cuisine on the first floor: Dry fried Niuhe is too wet, steamed phoenix claws do not taste. These two snacks are not very authentic.Okay, what are you mixed?The phoenix claws are not good and sell abalone!Who dares to buy?"
1,非常不错的酒店，比起国内除上海以外大多数城市的五星级酒店，它的硬软件真可算够格的。性价比高啊。说它地理位置较偏是事实，但第二天对周边环境熟悉了，出行就方便多了，其实走出酒店不多远就是公交车站，有好多条线路通往市区各个地方，而且只要你对酒店在城市的地理位置了解了，外出打的不太会遭斩。吃饭就更不用说了，出门300米左右就是条美食街，包括陶然居在内的许多特色酒楼小吃店比比皆是。到了晚上灯红酒绿好不热闹。唯一欠缺的是附近缺少大型的超市大卖场，我们想购买当地土特产品带回家，需费些功夫。以后来重庆还是会选这家酒店。,"Very good hotels, its hard software is really sufficient compared to five -star hotels in the country except Shanghai.The price is high.It is true that it is more geographical, but the next day is familiar with the surrounding environment, it is much more convenient to travel. In factKnowing the hotel's geographical location in the city, it is not too much to be hit.Not to mention eating, about 300 meters out is a food street, many specialty restaurant snack bars, including Tao Ranju.In the evening, the red wine is green.The only lack of lack of large supermarkets nearby. We want to buy local local products to take home, which requires some effort.In the future, Chongqing will still choose this hotel."
0,我住的是酒店标准间（203房间），里面设施撑死2星级的标准，而且由于二楼有餐厅，房间里一股厨房未，相当恶心,"I live in the hotel standard room (room 203), which supports the standard of 2 stars, and because there is a restaurant on the second floor, a kitchen in the room is not, it is quite disgusting."
1,"服务很仔细,房间陈色虽旧,但用品挺干净.服务员很有素质,拾到钱包想办法还给了我,我非常感激.","The service is very careful. Although the room is old, the supplies are quite clean. The waiter is very quality. I picked up the wallet and found it to give me back. I am very grateful."
0,怎么看都是个要倒闭的招待所，虽然只有300多的价格，但还是不值。但这是个离殷墟很近的住所。所以没有选择。提醒去殷墟的朋友，千万不要去王陵遗址！！！真的是个废墟。,"It looks like a guest house that is going to go down. Although there are only more than 300 prices, it is still worth it.But this is a residence very close to Yinxu.So there is no choice.Remind friends who go to Yinxu, do not go to Wangling site!IntersectionIntersectionIt is really a ruin."
1,酒店除了所处位置非常有优势外，其他的应该没什么了。设施简单、陈旧，但对于住一晚的我来说，也能将就。,"In addition to the location of the hotel is very advantageous, everything else should be fine.The facilities are simple and old, but for me for one night, I can also."
1,太一般了网络慢的跟蜗牛一个等级还高速呢真晕补充点评2008年4月2日：也没早餐点评,"Too generally, the network is slow and the snail level is high -speed. Really dizzy and add comments on April 2, 2008: No breakfast review"
1,每次到福州都住这里，就是宾馆前台服务太慢了....,"Every time I arrive in Fuzhou, I live here, that is, the hotel's front desk service is too slow ..."
0,不想多说，就一句话，以后不会住了，不过前台的妹妹很漂亮。宾馆反馈2008年4月3日：尊敬的客户：您好！如您在锦昌大酒店入住期间有不愉快，敬请您把您的意见和建议告诉我们，我们将为您提供更优质的服务！总经理：黄同金联系电话：0791-2878108锦昌大酒店,"I don't want to say more, just a word, I won't live in the future, but the sister in the front desk is very beautiful.Hotel feedback on April 3, 2008: Dear customer: Hello!If you are unhappy during your stay at Jinchang Hotel, please tell us your opinions and suggestions that we will provide you with better services!General Manager: Huang Tongjin Contact Tel: 0791-2878108 Jinchang Hotel"
0,十一期间携程订的鸿展楼，网上说是四星，到地方一看怎么也不像，问服务员这是四星酒店吗？她说，是的啊，指了指大门上用红胶纸剪的四颗红五星。这就是四星，我昏。大堂人员解释，迎宾馆是四星，鸿展楼是附楼，没有四星，原来如此。房间很大，设备很旧，床单也很旧。不过价钱不贵，一天是178。早餐不太好，牛奶没有牛奶味，餐具也不是太干净。不过也不能小看这家酒店，每间房里有一本画册，上面满是朱容基、李鹏、经叔平等国家政要在这里的提字和合影留念。补充点评2007年10月7日：住酒店停车还要收费，我是第一次遇到。,"During the 11th period, Ctrip's Hongzhan Building, the Internet said that it is four -star. Why is it not like when you see it in the place? Ask the waiter? Is this a four -star hotel?She said, yes, refers to the four red five -star cut with red glue paper on the door.This is the four -star, I am faint.The lobby staff explained that the welcome hotel is four stars, and Hongzhan Tower is an attached building. There are no four stars.The room is large, the equipment is old, and the sheets are very old.But the price is not expensive, one day is 178.Breakfast is not very good, milk does not have milk, and tableware is not too clean.However, you can't underestimate this hotel. There is a album in each room, which is full of words and group photos here with Zhu Rongji, Li Peng, and Jingshu Politatte's politicians.Supplementary comment on October 7, 2007: I still need to charge for the hotel to park. I met for the first time."
1,服务热情，交通便利，早餐品种少点，但是比较干净，下次去重庆还会去住~~~,"The service is enthusiastic, the transportation is convenient, and the breakfast variety is less, but it is relatively clean. I will live in Chongqing next time ~~~"
1,2月底去的，酒店古色古香，房间也不错，卫生间很大，可是冲淋房里面居然没安装喷头！摆设，没法用，热水要放半小时才会出来。环境实在太好了，与湿地公园隔湖相望，坐在后花园的竹林里望着湖发呆也是非常享受的事。还有，在酒店买湿地公园的门票可以打折。我们去的时候是赏梅季节，很美，西溪湿地，难得的一片净土！,"At the end of February, the hotel was antique, the room was also good, and the bathroom was very large, but there was no sprinkler in the punching room!The furnishings are not available, and the hot water will not come out for half an hour.The environment is really good. It is very enjoyable to sit across the lake from the Wetland Park and sit in the bamboo forest in the back garden. It is also very enjoyable.Also, tickets for buying wetland parks in the hotel can be discounted.When we go, we are the season to enjoy the plum. It is beautiful, Xixi Wetland, a rare pure land!"
1,"我是4月3日去的,人比较小,在前台要特别说明才拿到向山景方向的房间.从房间的阳台望出去的风景真是太美了,房间的装修开始陈旧了.早餐的种类算比较多,不错。温泉里的服务也很好,温泉池也比较干净.有时间的话我还会到这里度假(一定要选在非节假日).宾馆反馈2008年5月29日：酒店分为山景与河景两个方向，都很美丽，透过180度大阳台，可以欣赏到外面美丽的自然风景，欢迎您下次光临！","I went on April 3, and the people were relatively small. I had to explain it in the front desk to get the room in the direction of the mountain view. The scenery looking out from the balcony of the room is really beautiful.More, good.The service in the hot spring is also very good, and the hot spring pool is relatively clean. If I have time, I will come here for vacation (be sure to choose in non -holiday holidays).In this direction, it is very beautiful. Through the 180 -degree balcony, you can enjoy the beautiful natural scenery outside. Welcome to come next time!"
1,"很不错的一个酒店,床很大,很舒服.酒店员工的服务态度很亲切.","A very good hotel, the bed is very large, very comfortable. The service attitude of the hotel employees is very kind."
1,据说是秦皇岛还不错的饭店，但是感觉硬件设施一般。卫生间很旧，而且有异味。个人认为，整体来说，价钱偏高了。后来去了海边，认为那个假日酒店应该更好些。服务没有什么问题，但是也没有什么特别值得一提的地方。,"It is said that it is a good restaurant for Qinhuangdao, but it feels that the hardware facilities are average.The bathroom is very old and odor.Personally, the price is high as a whole.Later, I went to the beach and thought that holiday hotel should be better.There is no problem with the service, but there is nothing particularly worth mentioning."
0,酒店自己宣传是5星级别，价格也不菲。所以我们就按照新五星酒店标准看看：1、位置在人和镇。总机服务员、到酒店网站上，没一个描述清晰的。后来才知道，就是人和镇。给司机说人和镇都知道。说金开大道，绕了28元钱才到！2、正门那个门卫就是稻草人，基本没用，就是打个手势。拦出租还是要自己去，我还以为会配备的对讲，可以在院子外面帮客人拦。3、1410房间装修材质很糟糕，很低档。洗手间天花板的刷涂料掉满了洗手台。玄关的地板是劣质，已经开裂，边缘已经破损。4、窗子是低档的铝合金，表面是很脏的划痕。不是隔音玻璃，对着个大十字路口，晚上客人睡得挺不容易。一个07年新建成的酒店，这样的偷工减料，不可原谅！5、房间很大。但没有细节可言。只有空旷的大。6、门把手的纸牌很容易在开门时候碰掉7、衣柜很难发现，发现后很难打开，没有推手，滑轨简直不可思议。就是最劣质的滑轨也不会那么沉重！不知现在忙于减肥的弱女子们住的话怎么打开。8、卫生间的电吹风，插座在哪里？根本没有电吹风的插座！9、酒店电梯内装修很阴暗，大堂很亮，进了黑洞洞的电梯，阴森恐怖，没有一点人气，看不出任何高档。10、房间的开关、插座觉得是假冒伪劣，左床头的开关是坏的，卫生间只有一个插座，且不能使用，安装的松松垮垮，能看到墙里的洞。11、体重秤是坏的。12、毛巾有劣质的洗涤剂味和烘干机的味道13、房间书桌上的彩页非常肮脏，里面有很多污物。不知道服务员整理时候有无看到。里面根本粘和在一起就翻不开。14、前台接待不体贴，下雨，办手续时候，别看门童很多，没人会早些问你是否需要出租，这点连北京的某家三星酒店都不如。记得去酒泉宾馆，一个戈壁上的五星，比在城市的所谓的世界第五品牌酒店的服务都体贴。15、前台我要了2次水单，但她都忘记，没有给我。16、五楼的日韩餐厅最糟糕，三文鱼刺身，我当时真的想退掉算了，那么不新鲜了也敢端上来，佩服厨师昧良心的勇气！为了赚钱，什么都不顾了。总之，3星半的硬件，3星的服务。当作高价的汽车旅馆用还可以。不会再去了。建议酒店，还是去看看君临君豪，还有金源。硬件，软件。位置，都比新开业的戴斯厚道多了。别拿中国消费者当傻子了。最后自能是赔了本钱又丢了牌子。多罗唆一句，很喜欢金源旗下的酒店，酒店数量不多，但开一家叫座一家。觉得硬件软件真的是在用心做事的企业。,"The hotel's own publicity is a 5 -star level, and the price is expensive.So let's take a look at the new five -star hotel standard: 1. Location in people and towns.None of the descriptions on the hotel waiter and on the hotel website.Later, I learned that it was people and town.Both people and town know to the driver.Said Jin Kai Dao, and it took 28 yuan to arrive!2. The gatekeeper of the main gate is the scarecrow, which is basically useless, just to play a gesture.I still have to go to rent. I thought I would be equipped with a conversation, and I could help guests stop outside the yard.3. The decoration of the 1410 room is very bad and very low.The brush coatings of the toilet ceiling are full of hand -washeds.The floor of the porch is inferior, it has been cracking, and the edges have been damaged.4. The window is a low -grade aluminum alloy, and the surface is a very dirty scratch.It is not sound insulation glass, facing a large crossroad, it is not easy to sleep at night.A newly built hotel in 2007, such cut -off workers are unforgivable!5. The room is large.But there is no detail at all.Only empty.6. The cards of the door handle are easy to touch when the door is opened. 7. The wardrobe is difficult to find. It is difficult to open it after discovering. There is no pushing hands. The sliding track is simply incredible.The worst -quality slide rail will not be so heavy!I don't know how to open if the weak women who are busy losing weight now.8. Where is the hair dryer in the bathroom?There is no hair dryer at all!9. The interior decoration of the hotel elevator is very dark. The lobby is very bright. After entering the elevator in the black hole, it is scary and horrible. There is no popularity and no high -end.10. The switch and socket of the room feels counterfeit. The switch on the left bed is bad. There is only one socket in the bathroom, and it cannot be used. The loose installation can be seen.11. The weight scale is bad.12. Towels have inferior detergents and taste of dryers 13. The color pages on the room desk are very dirty and there are many dirt.I do n’t know if the waiter sorted out.It can't be turned around at all.14. The front desk reception is not considerate, rainy, do not look at the door children when you do the formalities. No one will ask you if you need to rent it early. This is not as good as a Samsung Hotel in Beijing.Remember to go to Jiuquan Hotel, a five -star on Gobi is considerate than the service of the so -called world -so -called world -so -called world -so -so -called world.15. I asked the front desk twice, but she forgot all of them and didn't give it to me.The worst of the Japanese and Korean restaurants on the fifth floor, the sashimi of salmon, I really wanted to retreat at that time, so I dare to come up and admire the courage of the chef's conscience!In order to make money, I ignore anything.In short, 3 -star hardware, 3 -star service.It can be used as a high -priced motel.I won't go again.It is recommended that the hotel, to see Junlin Junhao, and Jinyuan.Hardware, software.The position is much more kind than the newly opened Dises.Don't take Chinese consumers as fools.In the end, he could lose the capital and lost the brand.Doro said that he likes Jinyuan's hotel very much. The number of hotels is not large, but the house is opened.I feel that hardware software is really a company that is doing things attentive."
1,"酒店内部装修还好,不过外部外景比较偏僻,一楼的鱼村菜不行,不过酒店对面的最高台是合肥比较上档次的餐饮酒店","The interior decoration of the hotel is okay, but the external location is relatively remote. The fish village dishes on the first floor are not good, but the highest platform opposite the hotel is Hefei a relatively high -grade catering hotel"
1,"到达酒店已近十一点,大堂昏暗陈旧,前台小姐对我的出现有些木然,过了半天才回过神来,行李员倒是微笑到房间;房间很干净,只是没有浴缸,洗脸池的水很小,但仍溅的一塌糊涂,设计不能只追求美观,打开龙头就是温泉,不错,只是花洒不用时也在滴水,酒店难道不检修吗?床太硬,只能把被子垫在底下;要睡觉时发现有一盏灯没有开关可以关掉,致电客房服务,他们也是一头雾水,不过还是马上派电工上来修改线路,这时已是半夜一点多.清晨拉开窗帘,美极了,精致的花园和泳池,兰色的大海与椰廊,连接的是那麽完美,再加上新鲜的空气,简直不愿离开阳台.吃完早餐去海边,沙滩椅早已客满,淡季如此,旺季怎麽办?下午宝宝午睡时,房间顶部的喇叭突然响起了音乐,致电客房服务,又是一头雾水,两分钟后不知为何又停了.关于吃,自助早餐不怎麽样,西餐厅味道挺正宗,中餐厅也不错,只是海鲜品种太少","It has been nearly eleven o'clock in the hotel. The lobby is dim and old.Small, but still splashing a mess, the design cannot only pursue the beauty. Opening the faucet is hot spring, yes, but the shower is dripping when it is not in use. Is the hotel not overhaul?From time to time, I found that there was a lamp without a switch to turn off. The room service was called. They were also confused, but they immediately sent an electrician to modify the line. At this time, it was more than a little in the middle of the night. The curtains were opened in the morning.The connecting the sea and the coconut corridor and the coconut corridor are so perfect. Coupled with the fresh air, I don't want to leave the balcony. After eating breakfast and go to the sea, the beach chair is already full. What should I do in the peak season? In the afternoon? In the afternoon?When the baby takes a nap, the horn on the top of the room suddenly sounds music, and the room service is called, and it is foggy. I do n’t know why I stopped after two minutes. About eating, the buffet breakfast is not good, the Western restaurant is very authentic, and the Chinese restaurant is also in the Chinese restaurant.Yes, it's just that there are too few seafood varieties"
1,定了三间标间，入住时发现被安排在二号楼的底楼。进去了感觉不错：宽敞，清洁，无异味。最让人满意的是：整个晚上几乎听不到外面的声音，真是安静。山庄地理位置合理，到灵隐，太子湾，西湖苏堤，虎跑等地非常方便，处在这些景点的中心。环境幽、雅、静是主要特点。好了不说了，再说就会被怀疑为托了。,"Three standard rooms were set, and they were found to be arranged on the bottom floor of Building No. 2 during the check -in.It feels good after entering: spacious, clean, without odor.The most satisfactory thing is that almost no outside of the evening, it is quiet.The location of the villa is reasonable. It is very convenient to reach Lingyin, Prince Bay, West Lake Su Di, Tiger Run and other places. It is in the center of these scenic spots.The environment is quiet, elegant, and quiet.Well, let's not say it, and it will be suspected to be entrusted."

Hot sale housing prices will be 10 % off in general promotional house prices.The specific rules of this product have been clearly stated on Ctrip.com that guests can see the booking rules and regulations while booking.Since the product itself is a hot -selling promotion, when the guests choose the hot -selling product, the hotel also needs to have certain constraints on the guests who choose such products.

0,酒店很旧，服务很一般。只是离火车站比较近而已。实在没什么好的。携程的价格有很大的水分。,The hotel is very old and the service is average.It's just closer to the railway station.There is nothing good.Ctrip's price has a lot of moisture.
1,第二次住，定的时候明明是588含早的，结果到前台说是518不含早的，不过影响不大，其他都还好，总的来说性价比不错。,"For the second time, it was obviously 588 early. As a result, it was said that 518 did not include early, but the impact was not great. Others were okay. In general, the cost performance was good."
1,"环境和硬件不错,尤其是房间,我住的是2号楼,350不含早餐的,比较新,比较大,有点象小套房,也很通气,凉爽.缺点是软件方面需要改善,非自驾用户会不太方便,韩味亭较糟糕,前台服务人员很少,但房间服务人员还比较热情.","The environment and hardware are good, especially in the room. I live in Building 2. 350 does not include breakfast. It is relatively new, relatively large, a bit like a small suit, which is also very ventilated. The disadvantage is that the software needs to be improved. Non -self -driving users need to be improved.It is not convenient, Han Weiting is worse, there are very few service staff at the front desk, but the room service staff is more enthusiastic."
1,酒店房间还算可以，对得起五星级的称号。早餐品种也算是丰富。不足之处酒店近着大马路，楼层太低晚上睡觉有点吵。,"The hotel room is okay, which is worthy of five -star title.Breakfast varieties are also rich.The hotel is close to the big road, and the floor is too noisy to sleep at night."
0,问题：1.开始给的房间有很重的味道，后来调整了之后又是在空调排风的附近，噪声很大，第三次才换到还过得去的房间；2.服务业不专业，态度冷淡；3.早餐在上岛，品种很少。优点就是价格还算是便宜，在华侨城附近400多点的价格还真是难找到比较合适的地方。,"Question: 1. The room given to the room has a very heavy taste. Later, after the adjustment was adjusted, it was near the air -conditioning exhaust. The noise was very large.Cold; 3. Breakfast on the island, there are very few varieties.The advantage is that the price is cheap, and the price of more than 400 points near OCT is really difficult to find a more suitable place."

1,"该酒店作为四星级算是中规中矩,服务态度和设施还说的过去.大堂的西式小点心不错,物美价廉.不满意的地方:一.居然没有停车场,只能停路边还要收费,感觉很不贴心,自驾的朋友要有心理准备.二.九江好象没有五星级酒店,第一感觉该酒店是四星的应该会比较醒目吧,如果有人这么想就完全错了,我们自驾车两次经过门口竟然没看到,不论是楼还是大堂实在是太不入流了.","The hotel as a four -star is quite satisfactory. The service attitude and facilities also say the past. The western snacks of the lobby are good, and the price is good and low.It feels very unpretentious. Friends who drive self -driving have to be mentally prepared. 2. Jiujiang does not seem to have a five -star hotel. First, it feels that the hotel is four -star. It should be more eye -catching.I didn't see the driving twice passing through the door. Whether it was the building or the lobby, it was too influential."
1,"房间太小,早餐简单,虽然是豪华套房,性价比相差太远,但是地段还不错,逛街比较方便,服务也一般,掉了个充电器在房间,叫总台寄过来到付,居然还不愿意","The room is too small and the breakfast is simple. Although it is a luxury suite, the cost performance is too far away, but the location is good, the shopping is more convenient, and the service is average."
1,酒店的环境很好，但因为周边修路的缘故，进出市区堵的比较厉害。房间内的设施不错，但个别细节的维护还需要提高。,"The hotel's environment is very good, but because of the surrounding road construction, it is relatively strong in and out of the urban area.The facilities in the room are good, but the maintenance of individual details needs to be improved."
1,"交通很方便,离火车站很近,但是从酒店打车去车站由于道路设置原因要么停在坡底自己爬上去,要么兜一个大圈子绕上去,也就多4块钱但是花时间.房间还比较安静(9楼),但是晚上骚扰电话多,只能拔线.设施(包括电器)有点旧,服务不错.","The transportation is very convenient, and it is very close to the railway station, but because of the hotel's taxi from the hotel, it is either climbing up on the bottom of the slope due to road settings. Either a large circle around.Quiet (9th floor), but there are many harassment calls at night, and can only be pulled out. The facilities (including electrical appliances) are a bit old and the service is good."
1,希望大家也能像我一样，每家酒店都能尝试的住一下，因为每个酒店都各有特色,"I hope everyone can try it like me, because each hotel has its own characteristics"
1,酒店还可以，就是冬天没有暖风，冻的不行。,"The hotel is fine, but there is no warm wind in winter, and it is not frozen."
1,帮同事订过很多次，酒店位置很好，很方便。房间也不错。,"I have booked many times to help my colleagues, the hotel location is very good and convenient.The room is also good."
1,不错，我住过的最好的酒店，有家的感觉。让我抱怨，天啊！比我家里还舒服，怎么能让我睡得着觉啊,"Yes, the best hotel I have ever lives, and I feel like home.Let me complain, God!It's more comfortable than my home, how can I make me sleep?"
1,不知道为什么用CTRIP订的房价比自己去的要贵20门，，，，等待答复,I don't know why the house price booked in CTRIP is 20 more expensive than myself.
0,简单的一个字，差，就像是招待所，酒店比较偏，周边没有吃饭的地方，只有一家酒店自己开的餐馆，里面的东西两个字，难吃。,"A simple word, bad, is like a guest house. The hotel is relatively biased. There is no place to eat around. There is only one restaurant opened by a hotel. There are two words inside."
1,位置相当不错，出门对面就是屯溪老街，穿过老街就是商业中心。停车要付费，不爽。早餐不符合四星酒店的标准，品种少。,"The location is pretty good. Opposite to go out is Tunxi Old Street, and it is a business center through the old street.Parking is paid, unhappy.Breakfast does not meet the standards of the four -star hotel, with few varieties."
1,在北京用这样的价格能住4星酒店的确不容易了，不过这里也太偏僻了，理论上都不能算北京了。。。。,"It is not easy to stay at the 4 -star hotel at such a price in Beijing, but it is too remote here. In theory, it cannot be counted as Beijing.EssenceEssenceEssence"
1,房间干净，服务员很热情！值得一提的是餐厅，很便宜也很实在，呵呵！,"The room is clean and the waiter is very enthusiastic!It is worth mentioning that the restaurant is very cheap and real, haha!"
1,"虽然酒店的选址不是很好,但是如果去宝安出差,应该还是不错的选择,下次过来应该还会入住.","Although the location of the hotel is not very good, if you go to Baoan on a business trip, you should still have a good choice. Next time you come here, you should still stay."
1,去之前看了一些评价，期望值比较低。但到了酒店后发现还是蛮不错的，应该说够五星级。欠缺的是卫生间实在太小（我住的是行政房），另外早餐品种偏少，陆羽厅的中餐服务一般。,"I read some evaluations before going, and the expectation value is relatively low.But after arriving at the hotel, I found that it was pretty good. It should be said that five -star.The lack of the bathroom is too small (I live in an administrative house). In addition, there are few breakfast varieties."
0,房间小，很旧。晚上12点下到大堂去续房，居然看见一只大老鼠穿堂而过,"The room is small and very old.At 12 o'clock in the evening, I went to the lobby to continue the room, but I saw a big mouse passing by"
0,忘了说，前台服务较烂，中午在莫泰自营的“美林小厨”午餐后，有一个打包盒，想暂寄前台出去买包烟，前台男生说不寄放食品。我回酒店翻边所有“客户须知”无此项，相反要求客户将贵重物品寄前台。打包的鲍鱼，算不算物品？,"I forgot to say that the front desk service was relatively bad. After lunch at the ""Meilin Kitchen"" who was self -operated at noon, there was a packing box who wanted to temporarily send the front desk to buy a bag of cigarettes.I went back to the hotel to turn around all the ""customer notes"" without this. On the contrary, customers asked customers to send valuables to the front platform.Is the packaging abalone be considered an item?"
0,我在国庆前住了6楼的一间朝街的房间，特别吵。晚上很晚的时候，外面还是大卡车开来开去。早上天还没亮，就是卡车的声音。也许不朝街的房间会好点。还有就是卫生间特别小，小得只能容一个人转身。酒店不提供一次性的香皂，我是跟他们要才给的，还好，免费。卫生状况一般，将就吧。,"I lived in a room on the 6th floor before the National Day, and I was particularly noisy.When it was late at night, the outside was still driving.It was not bright in the morning, it was the sound of a truck.Maybe it will be better without the room towards the street.There is also the bathroom is particularly small, so small that can only be tolerated by one person.The hotel does not provide a one -time soap. I give it to them. Fortunately, free.Sanitary conditions are average, just just."
0,重庆佳宇英皇酒店绝对是重庆对客户信任度最差的酒店！！！本人平时到重庆一直住的是五星酒店，上周五入住重庆洲际酒店，周六已订好机票离开重庆，所以下午退了洲际，后去直港大道佳宇英皇酒店附近办事，因有些许事未了改签机票后大概晚11点多临时入住佳宇英皇酒店，12点还去二楼吃了宵夜，第二天退房结帐时酒店方说房间内有一大瓶依云矿泉水瓶口已动过，我说我晚12点入住，手上还有一瓶饮料未喝且放在冰箱里了，况且房间里也有免费的矿泉水提供，不存在打开又不喝，酒店方根本不相信客人的解释，且态度极端恶劣！！！其实一瓶水只有35元，但酒店方这种对客人的极端不信任不尊重深深伤害了我！本人作为携程的金牌会员，当即向携程投诉（投诉编号351812），携程很重视，承诺会加强对这种不诚信酒店的暗访，直至中断合作协议！个人感觉重庆佳宇英皇酒店这种服务怎么可以评上四星？！！！庆幸本人在重庆一直住的是五星！这个不诚信酒店将被本人列入黑名单！而且本人所有的朋友圈都将此不诚信酒店列为黑名单！！！奉劝想入住该不诚信酒店的携程会员，如一定要入住该酒店，请在入住时先自己查房！务必仔细查看房间所有设施及物品，以免又被该酒店作假！也奉劝佳宇英皇酒店管理层，一定要对自己的员工进行诚信教育！！！（各位携程会员可查看我对其他酒店所作的点评）,"Chongqing Jiayu Yinghuang Hotel is definitely the most trust in Chongqing's trust in Chongqing!IntersectionIntersectionI usually live in a five -star hotel in Chongqing.

1,相当不错的服务，房间也不错，值得住．而且位置很不错．,"Quite good service, the room is also good, it is worth living.And the location is very good."
0,如果你没有足够的耐心可以忍受差劲的服务，就不要入住了,"If you have not enough patience to endure bad services, don’t stay in"
0,房间太老了服务不周到不热情交通还好保安象混子前台服务冷漠,"The room is too old, the service is not thoughtful, no enthusiastic transportation, fortunately, the security of the security guard is indifferent to the front desk service"
1,服务很好。24小时供餐。我们晚上10点到酒店，专门为我们提供晚餐，很是感动，且价格也比较实惠。唯一感到不足的是，1号楼与2号楼的入住手续是分别办的，我们先开车找到酒店大堂，被告知这是2号楼，要到1号楼办手续。但携程订房时并未告知是几号楼。,"The service was excellent.24 -hour meal.We arrived at the hotel at 10 pm and provided us with dinner. It was very moved and the price was more affordable.The only thing I feel is that Building 1 and Building No. 2 are processed separately. We drove to find the hotel lobby first. I was told that it was Building 2 and went to Building 1 for procedures.However, Ctrip did not tell the Buildings when it was reservation."
1,位置就位于屯溪老街街口，非常方便，从火车站打车大概要6-7元，设施挺好，也很干净，房间布置也很有特色，对于我这个要求比较高的人来说很满意，同行的人也很满意！补充点评2008年8月12日：我们住的是3人间，早餐给露露和橙汁，小窝头很好吃，再要没给我，555宾馆反馈2008年8月13日：感谢您的点评，希望有机会再次光临本客栈！,"The location is located at Tunxi Old Street Street. It is very convenient. It is about 6-7 yuan from the railway station. The facilities are very good and clean. The room layout is also very distinctive.Satisfied, the peers are also very satisfied!Supplementary comment on August 12, 2008: We live in 3 people, breakfast to Lulu and orange juice. Xiaowitou is delicious, and I have to give me no more.Hope to have the opportunity to visit the inns again!"
1,设施不错，位置好，就是服务人员的水平差点。早上退房太慢，等了四十分钟。一个北京小伙和一伙上海人因为退房排队的问题在前台对骂，服务人员也不敢上前调解。下次住洲际或希尔顿。,"The facilities are good and the location is good, that is, the level of the service staff is almost.The morning check out is too slow and waited for forty minutes.A Beijing guy and a group of Shanghai people scolded at the front desk because of the problem of checking out, and the service staff did not dare to come forward to mediate.Next time I live in intercontinental or Hilton."
1,"房间的装修还可以,早餐一般.位置离火车站也就一个出租车起步价.大堂看着很气派.",The decoration of the room is okay. The breakfast is average. The location is the starting price of a taxi. The lobby looks very elegant.

1,环境不错，价格合理。房间没有太平洋酒店大，设施较旧。,The environment is good and the price is reasonable.The room is not as large as the Pacific Hotel and the facilities are old.
0,强烈建议大家不要住这个酒店，预订的时候没有说酒店二楼是卡拉OK厅，到晚上12点多了还在蹦迪，噪音吵得我睡不着觉。房间设施跟全国的如家都差不多，强烈抵制这样的店,"It is strongly recommended that you do n’t live in this hotel. When you book, you do n’t say that the second floor of the hotel is the karaoke hall. By 12 pm, it is still jumping. I ca n’t sleep noise.The room facilities are similar to the home in the country."
0,这家酒店实在不敢恭维房间差，服务差，就是地方还可以，价格便宜。入住后给的第一间房噪音巨大（前台肯定知道，故意给的），换第二间，外面大雨房间小雨（前台肯定也知道这个房间漏雨，故意的），换到第三间才能安稳睡个觉，这个酒店实在太烂了，服务不是一般的差。,"This hotel is really dare not compliment the room difference, the service is poor, but the place is okay, the price is cheap.After check -in, the first room is huge (the front desk must be known, intentionally given). In the second room, the heavy rain outside the room is light rain (the front desk must also know that the room is leaking rain, intentional).Sleeping, this hotel is too bad, and the service is not general."
1,房间、服务尚可，就是电视频道太少，门童不是很积极的服务，可能天气冷？,"The room and service are acceptable, that is, there are too few TV channels, and door children are not very active services. Maybe the weather is cold?"
1,地段很好，停车场也很大，开车的朋友去住还是比较方便的，3人的家庭房还是满大的，也比较干净，有电吹风，就是没有开中央空调，有个立式空调，就是声音有点响，可能是我对声音比较敏感吧,"The location is very good, the parking lot is very large, it is still more convenient to stay in friends. The family houses of the three people are still large and clean. There is a hair dryer.Just a sound is a bit loud, maybe I am more sensitive to the sound, right?"
0,至少在目前阶段，这个酒店不适合居住；同时，携程方面提供的信息未能真实反映酒店的情况，比较遗憾。,"At least at the current stage, this hotel is not suitable for living; at the same time, the information provided by Ctrip failed to truly reflect the situation of the hotel, it is regrettable."
1,性价比还不错。。。算是当地最好的酒店了如果是第一次去的话，可能会发现不太好找,"The price / performance ratio is not bad.EssenceEssenceIt is the best local hotel. If it is the first time you go, you may find that it is not easy to find"
1,从2004年起每年都会入住或介绍朋友入住，在豪生管理---退出---又接收管理的过程中，明显有不同的感受。现在豪生重新管理酒店后在软件服务上有明显的进步，但硬件设施有待好好维护和改进！至于对酒店的评价以前不同时期我都有评过，总的来说在上海市个不错的休闲度假酒店，特别是晚上吹着清新的海风，听着阵阵海潮拍打岸边的声音，会让长期在都市喧嚣中受煎熬的心顷刻安静下来.......,"From 2004, you will stay in or introduce friends every year, and you have obviously have different feelings in the process of managing management --- exit.Now that Hao Sheng has re -managed the hotel, it has made significant progress in software services, but hardware facilities need to be maintained and improved!As for the evaluation of the hotel, I have been evaluated at different times before. In general, a good leisure resort hotel in Shanghai, especially the fresh sea breeze blowing at night, listening to the sound of the sea tide to beat the shore, will make the sound of the shore, which will make the sound of the sea, which will make the sound of the shore.The torment that has been suffered in the hustle and bustle of the city for a long time quietly calm down ..."
1,"订的是山景房,房间还不错,挺干净.前台服务员有点小问题：一是人数偏少，只有两个人，另外最好多点笑容；二是前台服务员对本地的景点不熟悉是最大的遗憾了。","It is a mountain view room, the room is not bad, it is very clean. The front desk waiter is a little problem: one is that there are fewer people, only two people, and the other is the best smile.Unfortunately."
1,这次春节去金华玩在国贸住了一天，总体感觉是很不错的，宾馆的硬件和服务都很好。就是住宿停车要收费的，虽然收费不高，但是感觉别扭，这个好象是金华宾馆的通病。还有，早餐是88元的，好象是偏高了，并不值。,"I went to Jinhua for a day in the Spring Festival. The overall feeling is very good, and the hardware and services of the hotel are very good.It is for accommodation and parking. Although the charge is not high, it feels awkward. This seems to be a common problem in Jinhua Hotel.Also, breakfast is 88 yuan, it seems that it is high and worth it."
1,这个酒店住过了无数次了，客观的来说是个值得推荐的酒店，曾经的服务给我留下了无比深刻的印象，除了餐厅经理上次吃自助晚餐的时候给我递过名片说下次给我打折，结果我这次又去吃了，他们说要预定才可以打折，所以下次大家要去3楼大厅吃饭记得要预定的，其他还是不错的，推荐。,"This hotel has lived countless times. Objectively speaking, it is a recommended hotel. The once service left me an extremely impressive impression. Except for the restaurant manager, I gave me a business card to say the next time when I ate a buffet dinner last time.I gave me a discount. As a result, I went to eat again this time. They said that they would have to book to discount, so next time you have to go to the lobby on the 3rd floor, remember to book it. Others are still good. It is recommended."
1,酒店环境还可以，房间环境和设施也还可以，但早餐实在不敢恭维，比招待所还不如，希望改进。,"The hotel environment is OK, and the room environment and facilities are okay, but breakfast is really not as complimented. It is not as good as the hospitality house."
1,"我订的是祥和楼,房间和设施都很陈旧,看了房之后给携程打电话换成了泰和楼.房间还不错,是新装修的.美中不足是早餐时间太早,9点多就没了,没吃到.值得一提的是该酒店不时会有一些促销活动,比如我们当时订的是三间房,而酒店当时买三送一,也就是说订三间免费送一间,人多的话挺合适的,订房时问一问前台（订房时携程没说）,可以同时享受携程价格的．","I booked a Xianghe Building, the room and facilities are very old. After watching the room, I called Ctrip to the Thailand. The room was not bad. It was new., I did n’t eat it. It is worth mentioning that there are some promotional activities in the hotel from time to time. For example, we booked three rooms at the time, and the hotel bought three get one free, which means that three free to send one free room. There are many people.It is quite appropriate. When you book, ask the front desk (Ctrip did not say when booking), you can enjoy the price of Ctrip at the same time."
1,"位置不错,在市中心.周围吃饭等很方便.房间一如既往的干净","The location is good, it is convenient to eat around in the city center. It is very convenient to eat around."
1,入住后发觉设施较新，相比同等价格酒店而言，性价比高。应算4星标准。比附近的海南大厦感觉要好的多。,"After check -in, it is found that the facilities are relatively new. Compared with the same price hotels, the price is high.The 4 -star standard should be counted.It feels better than the nearby Hainan Building."
1,我住的是高级商务间，房间很宽敞，服务也不错。但是，1，没有浴盆；2，早餐太次；3，商务间没有宽带！4，换了几个电视遥控器，还是站在电视前才能遥控。,"I live in a high -end business room. The room is spacious and the service is good.However, there is no bathtub; 2. Breakfast is too much; 3. There is no broadband between business!4. After changing a few TV remote controls, you can still be remotely controlled before TV."
1,3月底入住的，是高级房。感觉床非常舒服，但是电视机有点落伍了，不是液晶的。服务员的态度非常好，而且因为离沟口很近，应该是去沟口游玩那几天的首选。,"At the end of March, it was a high -end house.I feel that the bed is very comfortable, but the TV is a bit outdated, not LCD.The waiter's attitude is very good, and because it is very close to the ditch, it should be the first choice for the few days to go to the ditch."
0,早餐非常简单和差，距离客房很远，需要到后面的附楼，或者通过弯弯曲曲的后勤走到，非常不方便。我住的豪华标间，装潢有点旧，较简单。办理行李寄存只有1个人，7到8个客户等着提和寄，等了约20分钟。退房也只有1个开票和结算的人，12点办理时，有10位左右的客户在等待，总台服务小姐说;领导只有安排一台电脑办理退房开票手续，结果我等了足足30分钟才办完。与四星级服务差远了。所有台阶没有斜坡，拉杆箱只有提着上，更没有行李员帮助提的。,"Breakfast is very simple and poor, far from the guest room, it is very inconvenient to go to the attached building, or walk through the curved logistics.The luxurious bids I live in, the decoration is a bit old and simpler.There are only one person in handling luggage. 7 to 8 customers are waiting for them to send and send them for about 20 minutes.There are only one person who invoiced and settlement for checkout. When it is handled at 12 o'clock, there are about 10 customers waiting. The lady of the general station service said; the leader only arranged a computer to check in the check -up invoicing procedures. As a result, I waited for enoughIt was completed in 30 minutes.It is far from the four -star service.There is no slope all steps, and the lever box is only held, and there is no help to mention the luggage staff."
1,1.装修还不错，但是整个酒店感觉不大气2.除了电视越显小气，房间总体入住还舒适，隔音不错，不像圣庭苑酒店世纪楼，晚上睡觉都能听到隔壁抽水马桶的声音3.早餐品种不多，一般般,"1. The decoration is not bad, but the entire hotel feels not at the moment. 2. The more stingy in the TV, the overall room is comfortable, and the sound insulation is good. Unlike the Century Building of the Holy Tingyuan Hotel, you can hear the sound of a toilet in the next door when you sleep at night. 3.There are not many breakfast varieties, generally like"
1,"万豪的酒店硬件设施应该是相当不错的,只是因为春节入住的缘由吧,显得异常冷清,几乎看不到其他客人.大多数配套设施也歇业了,除了健身中心.健身中心的女清洁工居然对客人问及拖鞋和浴巾在哪里置若罔闻,回答说你自己找.找不到.害得我女儿光着脚丫,只穿了游泳衣穿过长长的过道进入泳池,除了冷,还有不雅.太过分了.","Marriott's hotel hardware facilities should be quite good, but because of the reasons for staying in the Spring Festival, it seems extremely deserted and almost no other guests can be seen. Most of the supporting facilities have also been closed. In addition to the fitness center. The female cleaners in the fitness center are actually rightThe guest asked where the slippers and bath towels were ignored, and answered that you could find it yourself. I ca n’t find it. It hurts my daughter to wear a swimsuit and wearing a long aisle to enter the swimming pool..unacceptable."
0,距二环高架桥太近，有噪音。附近小吃还是不少的。,It's too close to the second ring viaduct and noise.There are still a lot of nearby snacks.
1,新世纪大酒店真不错，我已是第二次入住此酒店，酒店房间又改造了新的单人间，内部还配备了液晶电脑和传真机，下次来就不用很麻烦的带电脑了，这次还正好赶上游泳馆开放，室内游泳馆的冲浪很不错，建议大家也来享受一下．,"The New Century Hotel is really good. I have been in this hotel for the second time. The hotel room has transformed a new single room. The interior is also equipped with LCD computers and fax machines. Next time, I do n’t need to bring the computer very much. ThisThe second time it happened to catch up with the swimming pool, the surfing of the indoor swimming pool was very good. It is recommended that you also enjoy it."
1,首先是让我满意的酒店接机服务，这一点是和大家取得共识的了。我是来酒钢办事的，去酒钢办事在这里住还是非常方便的，没有车服务员会热情周到的帮我订车。让我比较感动的是第二天要去办事，前一天却发现衣服挂了口子，因为急着出去，没时间处理，而且本人缝纫手艺也比较差，于是情急之中找到了服务员，回来的时候衣服补好了，皮鞋也擦亮了，一定没耽误事。在这里对她们的服务表示小小的感谢！补充点评2007年12月20日：看了大家点评，小补充几句：鄙视一下9785****的那位朋友，交教育基金才6块前，还要报销，没的报销还抱怨，住高级酒店的人啊！这是提外话，大家不要见怪。实在看不过去了，本人支持公益事业！,"The first is the hotel pick -up service that is satisfied with me, which is a consensus with everyone.I came to Jiu Gang to do things. It is still very convenient to go to Jiu Gang to do things here. Without a car waiter, I will help me book a car enthusiastic and thoughtfully.What moved me more was to go to work the next day, but the day before, I found that the clothes were hung up, because I was in a hurry to go out, I had no time to handle it, and my sewing technology was relatively poor. So I found the waiter in a hurry.After the clothes are made up, the leather shoes are brightened, and there must be no delay.Here I would like to express my little gratitude to their services!Supplementary comment on December 20, 2007: After watching everyone's reviews, a small added sentence: the friend who despises 9785 ****, before paying only 6 yuan for the education fund, you have to reimburse it.People in senior hotels!This is a outside word, don't see you.I really can't see it anymore, I support public welfare!"

0,"1,前台不能刷预授权，必须交押金。没有投诉机会，最多给你一张白纸写点意见，估计你转身就丢进垃圾桶了。2，主楼的所有单间和商务套房都是临街，老窗户不隔音，因为是在主干道上晚上车水马龙，除非你的瞌睡很好，否则很能睡得很踏实。第二天换到靠里面的标间楼下却又是靠锅炉和空调，晚上也很吵。第三天换到所谓的商务楼套房，其实就是普通的家庭楼房装修了一番，老房子，靠楼梯上下，这里住的都是当地打夜麻将的人，晚上在楼梯间大声喧哗，隔音更差。3，第四天退房后打当地出租车，问司机这个酒店如何，司机说这里几乎都是当地来“耍的”，打牌XXX等等，几乎很少出差的商务人员住这里。4，感觉很不好","1.

It is estimated that you turn around and throw it into the trash.2. All the single rooms and business suite of the main building are facing the street. Old windows do not sound insulation, because it is a horse for the evening on the main road.

After checking out on the fourth day, they hit a local taxi and asked the driver how this hotel.

0,酒店的通风不好，感觉很闷，设施很陈旧，根本达不到四星标准，早餐还过得去。,"The hotel's ventilation is not good, it feels very stuffy, the facilities are old, the four -star standard is not met at all, and the breakfast is still available."
0,"房间小的可怜,同样的价格,其他地方条件好多了.","The room is small, the same price, the other places are much better."
0,总体来说我对这个酒店十分失望。靠近立交，车子来往非常吵。我入住的810房间的阳台门锁是坏的，完全不能锁门，漏风很严重。3楼有一个ktv，我住在8楼还能听见咚咚的节奏声。不知道有多少时间没有清理过这个房间了，在被子里居然有巧克力的碎屑，把我的衣服都弄脏了！！空调只有在12点以后才能开，而且只供应非常有限的几个小时。千万不要去开卫生间门口的声音旋钮，他们一大早就会放音乐。早餐少的可怜，完全没有东西可吃。完全看不出来是07年刚建造的，地毯又旧又脏,"Overall, I am very disappointed with this hotel.Near the overlap, the car is very noisy.The balcony lock in Room 810 I stayed in was bad, and the door could not be locked at all. The leakage was very serious.There is a KTV on the 3rd floor. I can still hear the rhythm of the eunuch on the 8th floor.I don't know how much time I haven't cleaned up this room. There are actually chocolate debris in the quilt, so that my clothes are soiled!IntersectionThe air conditioner can only be turned on after 12 o'clock, and it only supplies very limited hours.Do not go to the sound knob of the bathroom door, they will play music early in the morning.Breakfast is poor, there is nothing to eat at all.It can’t be seen that it was just built in 2007, and the carpet was old and dirty."
1,"没过几天我还是选择住这个宾馆,怎么办呢,忘不了这里的早餐好滋味呀,个方便都挺好的~",After a few days I still choose to stay in this hotel. What should I do? I can't forget the breakfast here.
0,酒店环境非常一般，感觉只是2星级的，酒店外观比较旧，店内装修比较差。,The hotel environment is very average. It feels just 2 -star. The appearance of the hotel is relatively old and the decoration in the store is relatively poor.
0,对当地的酒店做了实地比较，这里硬件还算好的，装修比较新但实在不能给分太高。住的是套房，但卧室里没有电视，宽带不能用，说是在维修！聋子的耳朵-摆设。,"A field comparison of local hotels is made. The hardware here is pretty good. The decoration is relatively new but it cannot be too high.I live in a suite, but there is no TV in the bedroom, and the broadband cannot be used.Deaf ears-furnishings."
1,"酒店服务人员服务好,交通方便,价格适中,房间一般,缺点是早餐比较差,还要10元/人.","Hotel service staff has good service, convenient transportation, moderate price, average room, disadvantage is that breakfast is poor, and it costs 10 yuan/person."
0,海兴慕名而去！我的评价：地段差，服务一般般，硬件还可以！,"Haixing goes away!My evaluation: Poor location, general service, hardware!"
0,酒店前台服务很差！开了房间，进去一看，竟然有人入住了！还好没出什么事！要出什么事那谁负责呢？找前台领班反映，领班一变骂服务员一边给我换房间！脸上连笑容也没有！好象是我们顾客犯错！不知道搞什么鬼！给携城打电话投诉，携城的态度很好！酒店经理打到房间来赔礼道歉，还是找什么客观原因，说什么是服务员太忙了，出错！这个好象是低级错误吧！而且还说补偿一份早餐！态度生硬，好象我是属于那种住的起酒店，吃不起早餐的人！跟她们闹，就是因为我没钱吃早餐！真是气愤！不建议大家住这个酒店！,"The hotel's front desk service is poor!After opening the room, I went in and looked at it, and someone moved in!Fortunately, nothing happened!What is going on, who is responsible?Find the front desk leader to report that the leader changed the waiter to change the room while the waiter!There is no smile on his face!It seems that our customers make mistakes!I don't know what ghost!Call the city to make a complaint, the attitude of carrying the city is very good!The hotel manager hit the room to apologize, or for any objective reason, what the waiter is too busy, it is wrong!This seems to be a low -level error!And also said to compensate for a breakfast!The attitude is rigid, as if I am the kind of hotel that lives, people who can't afford breakfast!Make trouble with them because I have no money to eat breakfast!Really angry!It is not recommended to stay in this hotel!"
1,我已经住过两次了。比较满意，特别是接机服务，一个人也接，及时周到。宽带速度也比较快。但是没有大家说的免费果盘。,"I have lived twice.Satisfied, especially the pick -up service, one person also picks up, timely and thoughtful.Broadband speed is also relatively fast.But there is no free fruit disc."
1,客观的说，在平湖算是比较好的酒店，毕竟是挂牌三星。200多的价位，平湖像样、正规一点的，出只能是这一家了。房间设施还全，服务也蛮热情，性价比一般，毕竟是小城市，也没有过多的选择。,"Objectively speaking, it is a better hotel in Pinghu, after all, it is Samsung.At the price of more than 200, Pinghu is decent and regular. It can only be this one.The room facilities are full, the services are quite enthusiastic, and the cost -effectiveness is average. After all, it is a small city, and there are no too many choices."
1,出行比较方便，房间也很安静，住徐家汇就住宛平。,It is more convenient to travel and the room is very quiet.
1,是第三次住了，感觉不错，至少是温馨、安全、舒适的，酒店的各场所比较熟，会有主人的感觉。,"It was the third time, and it felt good. It was at least warm, safe, and comfortable. The hotels in the hotel were more familiar and there would be the owner."
1,很不错的一家酒店，早餐很丰盛，晚上还送水果和小点心，服务也不错。,"A very good hotel, breakfast is very rich, and fruit and snacks are also given at night, and the service is good."
1,"每次去哈尔滨都住这里,也不是咋爽,就是习惯了江景房那边不能开窗,一直有机器的轰鸣声,关窗没问题出行打车很方便说个事大家注意,一天早餐看到一个和尚,和几个山东老几一顿崩,还给他们请了菩萨,搞了二百块吧,问服务员小妹,曰:他不住这里,是来挣钱的,总来","Every time I go to Harbin to live here, it is not refreshing, or I am used to the roar of the machine that I can't open the windows. It has always been a roar of the machine. It is convenient to say that it is convenient to talk about a taxi., I collapsed with a few old Shandong, and I asked them to invite the Bodhisattva. I got two hundred yuan and asked the waiter, and said: He can’t live here. He is here to make money."
1,"刚从无锡回来,住了该酒店二号楼328YUAN的,总体感觉如下;房间干净,配制齐全还有液镜电脑;饭菜可口且不是很贵;最值得称赞的是服务水准,老公粗心大意把手机掉了,工作人员捡后马上送回,赞了!饭店的员工几乎都是笑脸相迎,很难得,单从这点就间接提升了入住该饭店的理由!","I just returned from Wuxi and lived in 328Yuan, Building No. 2 in the hotel. The overall feeling is as follows; the room is clean, the preparation is complete, and there is a liquid lens computer; the meal is delicious and not very expensive;After dropping, the staff returned immediately after picking up, praised! The restaurant employees were almost smiling, and it was rare. From this, it indirectly improved the reason for staying at the hotel!"
1,住的是江景房，房间超大，环境一流，价钱不算高（258元包2早），美中不足是服务有点跟不上，总体不错。,"The Jiangjing house is living, the room is large, the environment is first -rate, and the price is not high (258 yuan bag 2 early)."
0,房间隔音效果超级差，晚上竟然能听到外面在搓麻将和讲话声！半夜被吵醒好几次，我晕死！！,"The sound sounding effect of the room is super poor, and you can hear the outside of the mahjong and speaking outside at night!I was awakened several times in the middle of the night, I fainted!Intersection"
0,客房环境级差，房间里时常可以看见“小强”，新铺的床单上由占整个面积3分之2的不知道是什么液体留下的印记，还夹杂着3、4个黑鞋印，恶心之极。卫生间所有的下水都很慢，在浴缸里冲澡每5、6分钟得听一小会儿，要不就水淹七军了，毛巾都是灰色的，实在是差劲。建议想入住德请慎重考虑。,"The environmental level of the rooms is poor, and ""Xiaoqiang"" can often be seen in the room. The new shop's sheets account for two -thirds of the entire area. I do n’t know what liquid is left.pole.All the launch of the bathroom is very slow. Every 5 or 6 minutes in the bathtub, you have to listen to a small time. Otherwise, the water is flooded. The towels are gray, which is really bad.It is recommended that you want to stay in Germany, please consider it carefully."
0,价格在贵阳算便宜的，不过房间太旧，够大，空调暖风白天不开，生气！,"The price is cheap in Guiyang, but the room is too old and large enough. The air conditioner is not open during the day and angry!"
0,订的￥258的高级标准间（因看到￥248的无窗），但住进去看一样没窗，只是有块玻璃上贴了幅画，后面再点了盏灯，无语；再说早餐吧，说是送早，在前台没有提示时间等，进了房间看餐券没有时间，想到9点去没问题，等我9点一刻去，早餐早没影了，问服务员，很不高兴的说9点就结束，怎么不早点来，好像是顾客的错，简直无语，房间设施还行吧。,"The senior standard room of ￥ 258 is booked (because I saw the window of ￥ 248), but there was no window to see it, but there was a piece of glass on the glass, and then the lamp was lit.Said to send early, there is no prompt time in the front desk, wait for the room to see the dining coupon, there is no time to think of 9 o'clock, wait for me to go at 9 o'clock, and the breakfast is not shadow. Ask the waiter, very unhappy to say that 9 o'clockAt the end, why not come earlier, it seems that it is the customer's fault, it is simply speechless, and the room facilities are okay."
0,"洒店的房间太小,设计也不合理。电梯太少,三十几层楼才只有两个电梯.早餐还需先到三楼走一条长廊后再转电梯到37楼,等一次电梯最少要花上5分钟。价格也偏贵，加上早餐及宽带的费用后，与五星级的酒店差不了多少。宾馆反馈2008年4月25日：首先需要给您更正的就是,我酒店总共有29层,而早餐在27楼,电梯一共有三个,房间有大小区别,可能您这次所住的比较小,关于宽带,08年我们已经将宽带免费,而且给予携程用户含早的优惠,希望您继续支持!!!","The room of Saodian is too small and the design is not reasonable.There are too few elevators. There are only two elevators on more than 30 floors. You need to take a promenade on the third floor and then turn the elevator to the 37th floor first. It takes at least 5 minutes to wait for the elevator.The price is also expensive. After breakfast and broadband, it is not much worse than a five -star hotel.Hotel feedback on April 25, 2008: The first thing to be corrected to you is that there are a total of 29 floors in our hotel, and the breakfast is on the 27th floor. There are three elevators.Regarding broadband, in 2008, we have already free broadband and give Ctrip users an early discount. I hope you will continue to support it !!!"
1,九寨沟喜来登国际大酒店是五星级大酒店，价格不菲，尽管携程的价格已经便宜了许多，但是的确有点名不副实。主要有以下几点让人不是很满意：1、酒店号称在九寨沟沟口，但实际上距离沟口还有一公里半的距离。只是喜来登的广告牌确实屹立在沟口位置。2、酒店的娱乐设施比较不好，桌球、电玩、网吧聚集一室，空气不好，而且设备也少，不过，喜来登的客人也不多，可能也用不到很多的设备吧。3、酒店的自助早餐价格还是很贵的，但是品种实在是很少。4、酒店的大床间的床真的是很大，居然是双床间的两张大床拼成的，床的宽度可想而知，半夜起来要爬半天才能摸到床灯。5、这个酒店给人的感觉就是贵，价格绝对是五星级的，但是其他方面也就跟好点的四星级宾馆差不多吧。而且酒店周围是完全找不到吃饭的地方的，荒芜一片，所以，这也要减点分吧。,"Jiuzhaigou Sheraton International Hotel is a five -star hotel with a high price. Although Ctrip's price is much cheaper, it is indeed a bit unrealistic.The main points are not very satisfactory: 1. The hotel claims to be in the mouth of Jiuzhaigou, but it is actually one kilometer and a half distance from the mouth of the ditch.It is just that the billboard of Sheraton really stands in the mouth.2. The hotel's entertainment facilities are relatively bad. Turn on billiards, video games, and Internet cafes gather in one room. The air is not good, and the equipment is small. However, there are not many customers in Sheraton, and many equipment may be used.3. The price of buffet breakfast in the hotel is still very expensive, but there are very few varieties.4. The bed in the big bed in the hotel is really large. It is actually made up of two large beds between the double bed. The width of the bed can be imagined. When you get up in the middle of the night, you need to crawl for a long time to touch the bed lamp.5. This hotel feels expensive, and the price is definitely five -star, but it is almost the same as the better four -star hotel.Moreover, the hotel is completely unable to find a place to eat at all. It is barren, so it is necessary to reduce points."
1,"酒店房间很好,很温馨.且有几本书供客人看.但没有针线包,害的我跑到楼下要的.周边饭馆较少,房间内的上网速度慢.","The hotel room is very good and very warm. There are a few books for guests to read. But there is no needle kit, I run downstairs. There are fewer surrounding restaurants, and the Internet speed in the room is slow."

1,我不太喜欢这里，装修环境确实都不错，有免费的水果送，但缺陷是晚上睡觉时如果不关洗手间的门，会感觉很吵，管道时不时会传出像消化不良似的声音，一女的，住起来感觉很害怕。第二天晚上还是那样，也不想起来换，只有吃了点谷维素（调节神经，也算安眠的吧），才睡好，咳,"I do n’t like it here. The decoration environment is really good. There are free fruit delivery, but the defect is that if you do n’t care about the door of the toilet when you sleep at night, you will feel very noisy. From time to time, the pipeline will come out.I feel scared when I live.The next night is still the same, I don't want to change it. Only after eating a bitchi (regulating the nerves, it is also a sleeping), I sleep well, cough, cough"
1,很满意的一家酒店，装修不错，那天住下晚上房间的网络出了问题，负责网络的人又下班了，服务员很热心的带我到楼下商务中心免费上网。送机服务也很好，总之很满意，以后去昆明就住经贸了！,"A very satisfactory hotel, the decoration is good. There was a problem with the network of the room next night. The person in charge of the Internet was off again. The waiter took me to the business center downstairs to go online for free.The machine service service is also very good."
0,房间狭窄、简陋。酒店外观倒不错。旅游景点的度假型酒店而已。结帐时看到客人和前台大声争执，看来是酒店说毛巾弄脏了，要求赔偿。实在小家子气。总体看性价比不高。,The room is narrow and humble.The hotel's appearance is good.Tourist attractions for holiday hotels.I saw the guests arguing loudly at the front desk when checking out. It seems that the hotel said that the towel was soiled and asked for compensation.It's really a little bit of anger.The overall cost -effective is not high.

0,其实就是桐城的会所，位置在桐城的最里面，从北苑路走进去要将近十分钟，不好找，不好打车。这样的条件300多元太贵了。补充点评2007年4月14日：说明：不知道现在价格如何，我的客人是三月十一号入住的。,"In fact, it is the club of Tongcheng. It is located in the innermost of Tongcheng.

1,上周住了三天，酒店服务还不错，但感觉有些旧。在文昌阁那边见到几家经济型酒店，感觉比较气派。,"I lived for three days last week. The hotel service was good, but it felt a little old.I saw several economical hotels on Wenchang Pavilion, and I felt more elegant."

1,各方面都不错，性价比也比较高。就是有些房间内设施要打电话才送来，例如电吹风，地图等。我住的是B区，好像要档次低一些，但还可以，只是我住的房间刚好有半堵墙挡住了风景，但是我同事住的对着湖面很漂亮。健身区正在装修，所以没能去游泳和运动很遗憾。大堂满高档的。房间内饰比较朴素。早餐还行。区位也还行，虽然离漂亮的团还有点距离。,"It is good in all aspects, and the cost performance is relatively high.There are some facilities in the room to call before sending, such as hair dryers, maps, etc.I live in area B.

1,"饭店地理位置是非常适合夏天度假的地方,硬件设施差于5星,服务达标,早餐自助餐比较简单,打的比较困难.","The geographical location of the hotel is very suitable for summer vacation. The hardware facilities are less than 5 stars, the service meets the standard, and the breakfast buffet is relatively simple. It is more difficult."
1,总体来说的确像大家点评的那样好。服务周到，态度很好，checkin和out速度都比较快。离开的时候因为要赶飞机没时间去吃早餐，貌似是他们的大堂经理还是什么其它服务人员还一直提出要替我们装一些食物带走，让人感觉很舒服。拉丁餐厅的自助餐还不错，那个男歌手声音也很好听^^超喜欢豪华房的那个圆形小沙发，呵呵^^如果说还有什么需要提高的话，可能就是卫生间的设施可以再好一些吧，不过现在这样也能接受。房间还提供了大同地图，旅游攻略等等，很人性化。总之就是很满意啦，如果有机会再去大同应该还会选择这里的^^,"Overall, it is indeed as good as everyone commented.The service is thoughtful, the attitude is very good, and both Checkin and OUT are relatively fast.When I left, I did n’t have time to eat breakfast because they had to catch the plane. It seemed that their lobby manager or any other service staff had always proposed to install some food for us, which made people feel very comfortable.The buffet of the Latin restaurant is not bad, and the male singer's voice is also very nice ^^ Super round sofa who likes the luxurious room, haha ^^ If there is any need to improve, it may be that the facilities in the bathroom can be better, right?But this can be accepted now.The room also provides Datong maps, travel strategies, etc., which is very humane.In short, it's very satisfied. If you have a chance to go to Datong, you should still choose here ^^"
1,"我在6月19-21号又入住了该酒店,还是一副老样子,问前台能否换楼尘老是回答要等半小时,不知为何?望酒店在各方方面面有待提高!","I stayed at the hotel on June 19-21, and I was still an old way. Asked if the front desk can change the building to the dust, I always answer for half an hour. I do n’t know why? I hope that the hotel needs to be improved in all aspects!"
1,房间很大，还有海景阳台，走出酒店就是沙滩，非常不错。唯一遗憾的就是不能刷银联卡，不方便。,"The room is very large, and there is a sea view balcony. When you walk out of the hotel, it is the beach, which is very good.The only regret is that it cannot be used to swipe the UnionPay card, which is inconvenient."
0,"这酒店太烂了，左、右及后边是3个大型的娱乐场所，吵闹声一直到凌晨3点多，酒店隔音很差。房间装修很俗，中央空调声音很响。宾馆反馈2008年7月15日：尊贵的客人，谢谢您对本酒店提出宝贵的意见。我们非常地抱歉在您入住本酒店期间给您带来的不便,对于您提出空调响的问题,我们酒店管理层非常重视,马上找专业人员改善空调的问题，今后我们将不断改进我们的不足,为您及所有宾客提供更优质服务,再次感谢您,并期待您的下次光临,谢谢!","This hotel is too bad. There are three large entertainment venues on the left, right, and back. The noise sounds until 3 o'clock in the morning, and the hotel's sound insulation is poor.The room decoration is vulgar, and the sound of the central air conditioner is very loud.Hotel feedback on July 15, 2008: Respecting guests, thank you for your precious opinions on the hotel.We are very sorry for the inconvenience that you brought you during your hotel. For your problem of the problem of air conditioning, our hotel management attaches great importance to the problem of seeking professionals to improve the air conditioner. In the future, we will continue to improve our shortcomings.Provide you and all guests with better services, thank you again, and look forward to your next visit, thank you!"
1,酒店的位置很好，世外桃源的感觉，特别推荐的是早上7点之前（因为免70块钱门票）去隔壁的明孝陵遛弯，空气质量和四周环境比前天的中山陵好多了。当时预定，是因为酒店是四星级而且价格不高，觉得是占了便宜，没想到去了之后，房间有很怪的味道，想换房间说没有了，四周都在重新装修，真搞不懂为什么不赶在国庆节之前竣工。房间硬件，服务和早餐最多就是三星级标准，建议大家不要有更高的期待值，否则会有些失望。,"The location of the hotel is very good. The feeling of Xanadu is particularly recommended to go to Mingxiao Mausoleum next door before 7 am (because it is free of 70 yuan of tickets). The air quality and the surrounding environment are much better than the night before.At that time, it was because the hotel was four -star and the price was not high. I felt that it was cheap. I did not expect that after I went, the room had a weird taste.Understand why it is not completed before the National Day.The room hardware, service and breakfast are the three -star standard. It is recommended that you do not have higher expectations, otherwise it will be a little disappointed."
0,这个所谓的四星级酒店是相当的差，非常旧的房间，非常简陋的设施，通过携程预定，还要将近五百元的高价。当然，也没有办法，因为是周末，又是承德的旅游旺季。可是，其他的酒店却没有这么高的价格，相比之下，天宝假日要比这里强百倍！,"This so -called four -star hotel is quite poor, very old room, very simple facilities. Through Ctrip's reservation, it costs nearly 500 yuan at a high price.Of course, there is no way, because it is the weekend and the peak tourist season of Chengde.However, other hotels do not have such a high price. In contrast, Tianbao holiday is 100 times stronger than here!"
1,山西万狮京华（维景国际）大酒店服务好，酒店环境很好．下次我还会光顾．相信我没错！！,Shanxi Wanshi Jinghua (Vitamin International) Hotels are good and the hotel environment is very good.Next time I will patronize.Believe me right!Intersection
1,"又要提到性价比的问题了,这个酒店以这个价格来说,算是很好的了,并且莆田的酒店差不多都这样的,对面台湾大酒店更糟,还不如华天金叶,推荐原因就是上述吃饭想吃简单的就在酒店吃个海鲜炒米粉吧,想吃不大贵种类多的就去对面吃集集小镇,想吃豪华的,强力推荐广化路的朝会粤菜,人均约一百0594-2817777,但是装修有点新潮,招待老骨董客人就不用去啦","It is also necessary to mention the issue of cost -effectiveness. In this price, this hotel is very good, and the hotels in Putian are almost the same. The big hotel on the opposite side is worse.If you want to eat a simple food, eat a seafood fried rice noodles at the hotel. If you want to eat a lot of valuables, go to the opposite side to eat and gather a small town.0594-2817777, but the decoration is a bit trendy."
1,"第一次入住该酒店.开始感觉很好.后来发现空调不冷.原来是单个房间的一个送冷风扇不转.虽然维修比较急时,我已经在只有通风冒汗的房子里住过一天了.但是我认为这应该是酒店的问题,他们应该要适时订期检查.我入住时正好碰上酒店中餐厅装修.停业三天,可没有事先通知.也没任何提示.当我们到了才知道,结果又得重新安排变更用餐地点.还好客人比较熟.否则会带来许多不便.希望酒店能改善这方面的服务.设施方面建议将电视机改变一下.宾馆反馈2008年6月11日：感谢您的宝贵意见，您提出问题确实是我们工作的失误。对于您在入住时给您带来的不便我们深感歉意，您提出的意见和建议我们会及时的改正，欢迎您下次入住！","I stayed in the hotel for the first time. I started to feel good at first. Later, I found that the air conditioner was not cold. It turned out that a cold fan in a single room did not turn. Although the maintenance was relatively urgent, I had lived in a house that had only ventilated and sweating for a dayHowever, I think this should be a hotel problem. They should check the period in time. I happened to encounter the decoration of the hotel in the hotel when I stayed. I had no notice for three days.As a result, you have to re -arrange to change the dining place. Fortunately, the guests are more familiar. Otherwise, it will bring a lot of inconvenience. I hope the hotel can improve this service. It is recommended to change the TV in terms of facilities. Hotel feedback on June 11, 2008: Thanks for thanksIf your valuable opinions, your question is indeed a mistake in our work.We apologize for the inconvenience you brought to you when you stay, and the opinions and suggestions you put forward will make corrections in time. Welcome to stay next time!"
1,"价格偏高,好象连云港这地方的酒店都偏贵.早饭不好.房间还不错,窗外风景还行.最重要是房间的窗户很隔音.床小,还是明珠万豪的床好些.","The price is high, as if the hotels in Yungang are expensive. The breakfast is not good. The room is not bad, and the scenery outside the window is okay. The most important thing is that the window of the room is very sound insulation. The bed is small, or the pearl is better."
1,"很好的酒店,床很大!卫生间的设计很好.很有艺术性!感谢入住两天那位男服务员对我的帮助谢谢!!","Very good hotel, the bed is very big! The design of the bathroom is very good. It is very artistic! Thank you for your help for me for two days for me !!"
1,"地板太滑，孩子洗澡出来摔了一跤，幸无大碍。宾馆反馈2008年6月23日：您好,再次看到您的点评很开心,感谢您再次选择国宾大酒店入住.酒店非常重视您提出的宝贵意见,酒店会针对卫生间地板滑的问题研究解决方案.希望下次入住时您能感受到我们的改进!我们期待您的再次光临!祝心情舒畅,工作顺利!","The floor was too slippery, and the child took a bath and fell down.Hotel feedback on June 23, 2008: Hello, I was very happy to see your review again.

The hotel will research solutions for the slippery of the bathroom floor.I hope you can feel our improvement next time you stay! We look forward to your visit again! I wish you a comfortable mood and a smooth job!"
1,酒店位置不错，去解放碑（抄小路），南滨路都很方便，我住的是278的大床房，房间大小还可以，布置的也很雅致，酒店服务也不错，浴室有吹风机，盥洗台右侧的伸缩镜子很不错，不管是男士刮胡子还是女士化妆，都很方便，自助早餐也不错，就是缺乏重庆特色。不足之处有三点：第一也是最让人不快的是房间的中央空调不可调，默认温度偏高，房间里比较热！第二淋浴间排水不畅；第三液晶电视遥控角度太小，非要直对电视才能调台，另外，房间里的书籍如欲观看还要收费，稍显小家子气了点儿。补充点评2008年6月7日：总的来说，这家酒店酒店就如店名一样，偏向于家居风格，并且酒店是重庆市中心少有的比较安静的酒店，而且出门左拐就是十八梯之类的老城区，对于喜好人文景观的朋友比较适合！宾馆反馈2008年6月12日：尊敬的客人，您好！从您的点评可以看出您是注重细节的人，很高兴您对酒店特色设施的认同。房间空调有1到3档可供调节。对于排水不畅，我们已于第一时间通知工程部的同事进行检修，给您带来的不便敬请谅解。房间的书籍是酒店搜寻的近期比较受欢迎的系列，方便您需要可以购买，免去了到书店挑选的麻烦。,"The hotel location is good. Go to Jiefang Bei (Copy Xiaolu). Nanbin Road is very convenient. I live in a large bed room of 278. The size of the room is OK.The expansion mirror on the right side of the stage is very good. Whether it is men's shave or women's makeup, it is very convenient, and the buffet breakfast is also good. It lacks the characteristics of Chongqing.There are three points of shortcomings: First, the most unpleasant thing is that the central air conditioner of the room is irresistible. The default temperature is high and the room is hot!The drainage in the second shower is not smooth; the remote control angle of the third LCD TV is too small to adjust the TV to the TV. In addition, the books in the room have to be charged if you want to watch it, which shows a little bit of anger.Supplementary comment on June 7, 2008: In general, this hotel is like the name of the store, which is preferred to the home style, and the hotel is a rare hotel in the center of Chongqing.Old cities such as old areas are more suitable for friends who like humanities!Hotel feedback on June 12, 2008: Dear guests, hello!From your comments, you can see that you are a person who pays attention to details. I am very glad that you recognize the hotel's characteristic facilities.The room air conditioner has 1 to 3 gears to adjust.For poor drainage, we have notified colleagues in the engineering department for repair at the first time. Please forgive me.The book in the room is a recently popular series of hotel search. It is convenient for you to buy it and avoid the trouble of choosing in the bookstore."
1,离火车站非常近，若有事赶火车就是很好的选择。如果要在香港购物的，则不太方便，毕竟还是尖沙嘴会更方便。但标准房（两张床的那种）太小了，床只有90公分宽，迷你啊！,"It is very close to the train station. It is a good choice to catch the train.If you want to shop in Hong Kong, it is not convenient, after all, Tsim Sha Tsui will be more convenient.But the standard room (the one with two beds) is too small, the bed is only 90 cm wide, mini!"

1,原来根本不知道有这么个地方，看到宾馆信息，突然想去看看。结果喜出望外，就是我想要的悠闲生活。空气清新得让人都醉了，我的嗓子、眼睛在深圳被折磨得不行，到了越王山就一点没提意见了。下次还要去！,"It turned out that there was such a place at all. When I saw the hotel information, I suddenly wanted to see it.As a result, I was overjoyed, which was my leisurely life I wanted.The air was fresh and drunk. My throat and eyes were not tortured in Shenzhen.Go again next time!"
1,很喜欢这个酒店。服务员都很热情。酒店的外观比较一般，但是房间里面还是不错的，很大很干净，房间里摆放了很多零食用品还有价格单，挺周到的。浴室的热水好像太热了一点，不太容易调冷。就这一个缺点吧。价格还算公道。不错！,"I like this hotel very much.The waiters are very enthusiastic.The appearance of the hotel is relatively average, but the room is still good, very clean, and a lot of snacks are placed in the room and there are price lists, which are very thoughtful.The hot water in the bathroom seems to be a bit hot, not easy to cool down.Just this shortcoming.The price is fair.good!"
0,"268元房间还算整洁.服务就不敢恭维了.结帐的时候出了件让我意想不到的事:我们是一家三口自驾游的,退房时非说我们用了印度神油和避孕套.靠!要说用了其它东西倒有可能,这玩意是可以当着已经上学的孩子用的吗?解释了半天,还是一口咬定我们就是用了.让我非常脑火的倒不是为了那几十块钱,而是明摆着的讹人的做法非常难以接受.后来见我发火了,楼层的主管才下来说,知道你们是家庭游客,可能是服务员搞错了.靠,刚才还一口咬定用了,现在又说搞错了?!真不知道这帮人是何居心.大家还是小心点为好!","The room of 268 yuan is quite clean. The service dare not compliment. There was something unexpected at the checkout: we were traveling by a family of three.Damn! It is possible to use other things. Can this stuff be used in the children who have already attended school? After explaining for a long time, it is still that we are using it.Ten dollars, but the practical approach of the people who placed it was very difficult to accept. Later, I saw me getting angry. The director of the floor came down and said that you are a family tourist, and the waiter may be wrong.Now that I said it was wrong?! I really do n’t know where this group is. Everyone is better to be careful!"
1,本次入住黎明国际酒店，总体感觉不错。原来对东北地区的服务水平有不太好的影像，这次入住，无论是前台，还是楼层服务员均热情和蔼，有求必应。只是作为一家五星级酒店，上网还要收费，不太理解。本次入住上网了，但结帐时忘了付费，不太好意思（20元），如下次还能入住，一定给补上。,"This time I stayed at the Liming International Hotel, and I felt good in general.It turned out that there was a bad image of the service level in the Northeast region. This time, whether it was the front desk or the floor waiters, they were enthusiastic and kind.Just as a five -star hotel, it is not understood that you need to charge the Internet.This time I stayed on the Internet, but I forgot to pay at the checkout. I am not very embarrassed (20 yuan). I can stay in the next time, and I must make up for it."
0,尽管近来酒店的价格上涨了许多，但因离电视台较近，已经住过许多次。而最近这次酒店的做法非常令人气愤。7月25日我因是下午3点的飞机去上海，中午在房间休息没有注意到时间下楼结账时是1点钟，前台服务员非常不客气地讲因为系统是自动计算的我这天的房间是按照1.5天结算。无论怎样说明都无济于事。更加令人气愤的是结帐后饭店帮我叫出租车去机场，司机根本不打表硬要120元才去。明明去机场最多不过80元。这样的酒店服务连2星都不如！！！！！,"Although the price of hotels has recently risen a lot, it has lived many times because it is closer to the TV station.The recent hotel's approach is very angry.On July 25th, I went to Shanghai because the plane at 3 pm, and I did n’t notice the checkout at the room at noon at noon at noon. The front desk waiter was very polite. Because the system was automatically calculated, my room on this day was automatically calculated.Set up according to 1.5 days.No matter how explained it is, it is not available.What is even more angry is that after the checkout, the hotel helped me call me a taxi to the airport. The driver did not have 120 yuan to go at all.Obviously, it is only 80 yuan to the airport.Such hotel services are not as good as 2 stars!IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersection"
1,酒店不错房间很大外面是条单行线车不多比较安静交通方便缺点就是：早餐太差非常差比最差的招待所都差千万不要在酒店吃早上出门向左转200米有个早餐摊还不错,The hotel's good room is very large outside is that there are not many one -line car cars. There are not many quieter traffic. The disadvantage is that: The breakfast is too poor and the worst is worse than the worst.
1,性价比不错，交通方便。行政楼层感觉很好，只是早上8点楼上装修，好吵。中餐厅档次太低，虽然便宜，但是和酒店档次不相配。,"Good cost performance and convenient transportation.The administrative floor feels very good, but it is noisy for renovation upstairs at 8 am.The Chinese restaurant is too low. Although it is cheap, it does not match the hotel grade."
0,因为工作关系，这里位置还是可以的，周围环境呢就不是很好，房间还行，干净就好。,"Because of the work relationship, the location is still possible. The surrounding environment is not very good. The room is okay and clean."
1,环境非常非常好，庭院式小栋别墅，虽然说酒店年限很久了，据说92年就有了，房间略小，但是服务、环境都绝佳，强烈推荐，绝对安静。唯一不好的是电视，最早的那种21寸彩电可能，我住的房间没出问题，朋友的房间进去电视不能开，找服务员，服务员很快搞定。数字电视的声音变化很大，这个频道正常声音，换个频道能吓死人――欧洲杯，凌晨的声音，唉，隔壁的那个……,"The environment is very, very good, and the courtyard -style villas. Although the hotel has a long period of time, it is said that it has been in 1992. The room is slightly smaller, but the service and environment are excellent. It is strongly recommended and absolutely quiet.The only bad thing is TV. The earliest 21 -inch color TV possibility. There was no problem with the room I lived in. The friend's room could not turn on the TV. Find a waiter. The waiter quickly got it.The sound of a digital TV has changed a lot. The normal sound of this channel can scare people -European Cup, the sound of the early morning, alas, the one next door ..."
1,已经住过几次了，这次的感觉好象商务酒廊里的食物比以前的品种少了，其他都还不错，桌球的价格挺高的，68/小时还要加15%的服务费，在当地来说就太贵了。,"I have lived several times. This time, it feels like the food in the business lounge is less than the previous variety, and the others are pretty good. The price of billiards is quite high.It is too expensive in the local area."
1,有比较才知道酒店的好，难怪外国友人超多选这里。是临时从别的酒店调整过来，因为订不到。房间好像新装修了，除了略偏小一点，色调和成新都很有感觉，尤其是增加了细节的注意：比如桌面的文具，储藏室的雨具等。一如既往的免费牛奶，入住当天还有果盘。座八楼的服务人员每次出入都有亲切的问候，电梯口的小点心也很周到。还有免费的报纸和上网电脑。周边餐馆多，打车也很方便。将成为我的常驻酒店,"Some comparisons know that the hotel is good. No wonder foreign friends choose here.It is temporarily adjusted from other hotels because it cannot be ordered.The room seems to be newly renovated. Except for slightly smaller, the color tone is very feeld, especially the attention of adding details: such as the stationery of the desktop, the rain gear of the storage room.As always free milk, there is a fruit plate on the day of check -in.Each service personnel on the eighth floor have cordial greetings, and the snacks of the elevator mouth are also very thoughtful.There are also free newspapers and Internet computers.There are many surrounding restaurants, and it is very convenient to take a taxi.Will be my resident hotel"

In addition, Fuzhou Road, which is close to the hotel, is a street for Nanchang Catering, gathered in many food restaurants and flavor snacks.I sincerely look forward to staying in the Qixing Business Hotel again!"
0,简直和招待所没有什么两样，下次再也不去了，价格还贵，携程怎么推荐这样的酒店糊弄我们。。。。。。,It's almost the same as the guest house. I won't go again next time. The price is expensive. How can Ctrip recommend such a hotel to get us.EssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssence
0,房间太小，无电梯，周围环境还可以，但正在修路，非常嘈杂,"The room is too small, there is no elevator, the surrounding environment is okay, but the road is building, it is very noisy"
1,3月25日入住，3月28日退房，房间比较不错，服务也很好，就是离地铁稍远点，从尖沙嘴到酒店需要15分钟左右的时间，如果不是特别紧张还是可以考虑入住，早餐不错。,"Check in on March 25, check out on March 28. The room is relatively good and the service is good. It is a little farther away from the subway. It takes about 15 minutes from Tsim Sha Tsui to the hotel. If it is not particularly nervous, you can consider check -in.Breakfast is good."
1,不错的一家酒店，服务人员都很有礼貌。住在二楼，虽然是木质结构，不过周围还算是比较安静的。早餐虽然品种不多，不过胜在时间较长。性价比较高啦,"A good hotel, the service staff are polite.Living on the second floor, although it is a wooden structure, it is relatively quiet.Although there are not many breeds for breakfast, they have a long win.The cost is relatively high"
1,通过携程定的豪华房，去到丽江给我升级到贵宾房，不错酒店的服务人员基本上挺有礼貌，前台入住退房都很快..贵宾房很大，很舒服，特别是厕所，晒着阳光入浴的感觉特别舒服，不过就是如果是晚上的话就会比较冷还有贵宾房的窗户靠着街上，早晚有行人经过街上会比较吵...其他都很好,"Through the luxury room of Ctrip, I went to Lijiang to upgrade to the VIP room. The service staff of the hotel is basically polite. The front desk is very fast .. VIP rooms are very large and comfortable, especially toilets.It feels very comfortable to bathe in the sun, but if it is at night, it will be colder and the window of the VIP room will lean on the street. In the morning and evening, pedestrians will be more noisy after passing the street ... others are all very good"

0,这是北京能见到的性价比最差的酒店之一，服务不错，但设施显然有问题，考虑到其价格，这些问题让人很不舒服，例如1#浴缸下水不畅，经请示多名服务员之后，得到回答是下水的管子太细，水就流不下，所以冲澡的时候可以泡脚啦2#床头有闹钟，但两次遇到这玩艺半夜狂叫，迷迷糊糊起来拔下电源了事价格不低，房间设施和环境不怎样，小毛小病不断。该酒店改名后，除了设施日益陈旧之外，不知道还有其它什么变化――当然，改名后价格上去了。如果有其它选择，不建议大家住这个地方。这里生意好象特好，我可能还会去住，唯一的原因是离我要去的地方实在太近，但住得我实在不爽――这个酒店这个价格，杀猪啊！,"This is one of the most cost -effective hotels in Beijing. The service is good, but the facilities are obviously problems. Considering the price, these problems are very uncomfortable. For example, the 1#bathtub is not smooth.After that, the answer was that the pipe of the water was too thin, and the water could not flow, so you can soak your feet when you take a bath. 2#The bedside has an alarm clock, but when you encounter this art, you scream in the middle of the night.The price of the power is not low, the room facilities and the environment are not good, and the small hair is small.After the hotel was renamed, in addition to the increasingly old facilities, I don't know what other changes have -of course, the price came up after the renaming.If there are other choices, it is not recommended to live in this place.The business here seems very good. I may still live. The only reason is that it is too close to the place I am going to, but I am really upset that I live in this hotel, kill pigs!"

1,大堂很气派，湖景很不错。住的是嘉宾楼，好像不是五星，房间里硬件很一般，尤其是毛巾，质量非常差，跟开元的名气差太多。服务倒还说得过去。强烈推荐东营的蓝海国际大饭店，硬件、服务、早餐都很好，可以参考携程上的评价。补充点评2008年7月7日：对了，我住的那个房间马桶还漏水，浴帘很脏，浴室地面上有很多毛发！！！难道迎宾楼和嘉宾楼有如此大的差距？？？重申一遍：我住的是嘉宾楼的标准间，408一晚。,"The lobby is very elegant, and the lake scene is very good.It is a guest building. It seems that it is not a five -star. The hardware in the room is very average, especially the towels. The quality is very poor.The service is over.It is strongly recommended that Dongying's Blue Ocean International Hotel, hardware, service, breakfast is very good, you can refer to the evaluation of Ctrip.Read review July 7, 2008: By the way, the toilet I live in is still leaking, the shower curtain is dirty, and there are many hair on the bathroom floor!IntersectionIntersectionIs there such a big gap with the welcome building and the guest building?IntersectionIntersectionReiterated again: I live in the standard room of the guest building, 408 a night."
1,总体感觉不错。不足之处：客房分散在各个小楼里，颇有不便。前台速度慢。,"Overall feels good.Disadvantages: The rooms are scattered in various small buildings, which is quite inconvenient.The front desk is slow."
0,不管是服务还是硬件都绝对够不上四星级，尽管前台确实挂着四星的牌子！！！依我看，就3星还不到。不过价格也步态四星级。,"Both services and hardware are absolutely not enough for four -star, although the front desk is indeed a four -star brand!IntersectionIntersectionAccording to me, it is less than 3 stars.However, the price is also four -star."
1,该酒店地理位置佳，在市中心特方便。酒店服务好、早餐品种丰富、可口。我住的商务数码房电脑速度、宽带速度令人满意，以后去南京就住这了。,"The hotel is located in good geographical location and is very convenient in the city center.The hotel service is good, the breakfast variety is rich and delicious.The speed and broadband speed of the business digital room I live in are satisfactory, and I will live in Nanjing in the future."
1,房间比较大，卫生也可以，对于这样的价位和地点，算是不错的了，网速一般，酒店比较新，整体满意,"The room is relatively large, and the hygiene is also okay. For such a price and place, it is good. The network speed is average. The hotel is relatively new and the overall is satisfied."
1,1月28和朋友入住，酒店前是人感寒了些，有像老式的招待所。住的豪，在1的2，能感到房很老了，但床和沙都很舒服，而且生是重新修的，很有4星的次。拉窗，屋外的景很好。因有在酒店用早餐，所以一有什么概念。在朔，家酒店是最好的，其境和客房完全不是西街上那些十到百元不等的旅店所能比。尤其感的是，入住的候因中南方大面降雪的，力，度朔全城停，酒店除了用自己的及外，服特地跑到外面去了新的暖我取暖，而且一再我。平心而，如果以香港、上海那些五星酒店中整套西方酒店培的服衡量，百的服似乎不，但在他的服人一很地道的切感。（也我有碰到劣的服）建入住的朋友多抱一些理解，不要於用客就是上帝的心挑剔。然，如果有，是要提出的。再一句，去的候6正在修，修好以後硬件施有所改善吧。,"January 28th with friends, the hotel was cold in front of the hotel, and there was an old -fashioned guest house.Hao who lives, in 2, can feel that the room is very old, but the beds and sand are very comfortable, and they are re -cultivated. There are 4 stars.Pull the window, the scenery outside the house is very good.Because of having breakfast at the hotel, what concepts are there.In Shuo, the hotel is the best, and its realm is not comparable to the hotels ranging from West Street at all.It is particularly feeling that the duke of the south of the south and the strength of Du Shuo stopped the city. In addition to the hotel, the hotel ran to the new warmth to warm me, and repeated me.Falate, if you measure the whole set of Western hotels in the five -star hotels in Hong Kong and Shanghai, hundreds of clothes do not seem to be, but he is very authentic.(I also have a bad service.) Friends who stay in have more understanding, not to be picky about God's heart.Of course, if so, it is proposed.Another word, the waiting 6 is being repaired. After the repair is completed, the hardware is improved."
1,酒店服务真的很好，房间也很整洁。从阳台可以看到海景，海上有好多停着的船只，蛮有感觉的。自助早餐很不错，品种还是蛮丰富的。,"The hotel service is really good, and the room is also clean.From the balcony, you can see the sea view. There are a lot of parcels on the sea.The buffet breakfast is very good, and the variety is quite rich."
0,"临街.非常的吵.酒店的负责清洁的都是顺手牵羊或者无德之辈.共住了三次好像.前二次一次是洗发水和一次洗澡巾忘拿了.打电话过去都是没看到.估计拿走了或者扔了.因为对合肥不熟悉,并且的确没什么好酒店.住了第三次.真汗!发现酒店的浴巾什么估计外包洗了.我知道全国洗酒店桑拿浴巾这行业非常薄利.甚至不能用自来水.不幸的是估计这家酒","The streets are very noisy. The hotel's responsibility is cleaning the sheep or a non -virtue. I lived three times. The first two times were shampoo and a bath towel forgot. I didn't see it in the past.It is estimated that it has been taken away or thrown away. Because I am not familiar with Hefei, and there is really no good hotel. I lived for the third time.

1,"从庐山下来住了一夜,第二天打出租车到长途车站乘车去黄山。这里就在火车站旁边，如果坐火车倒是近。但是离繁华地区稍微有些距离。住宿不含早餐，每位5元一份。没有觉得有火车噪音，好象夜间没有进站的车吧。洗澡的热水不错，温度挺热，随时都有。车站边上的快餐店饭菜口味极差，千万别去吃。","I stayed from Lushan for one night and took a taxi the next day to the long -distance station and took the car to Huangshan.It's next to the train station, if you take the train near.But a little distance from the prosperous area.The accommodation does not include breakfast, each 5 yuan per person.I didn't feel the noise of the train, as if there was no car entering the station at night.The hot water in the bath is good, the temperature is very hot, and there are at any time.The taste of the fast food restaurants on the side of the station is very bad, don't eat it."
1,在大连四星级酒店中能找到这么便宜价格的房间实在是不容易。刚开始还比较犹豫，260元的房间是什么样的？入住以后，感觉房间还是可以的，与正常的房间没什么差异。有窗户，能上网，一个人住还是很宽敞的，特别适合商务人士，性价比还是比较高的。酒店位置很不错，就在商业中心，购物，吃饭很方便，夜景很美，是个不错的酒店。,"It is not easy to find such a cheap price in Dalian four -star hotel.At the beginning, he hesitated. What is the room of 260 yuan?After staying, the room is still okay, which is no different from the normal room.There are windows and access to the Internet. A person lives is still very spacious. It is especially suitable for business people. The cost performance is still relatively high.The location of the hotel is very good. It is just a business center. It is convenient to eat and eat. The night view is beautiful. It is a good hotel."
1,在江地的旅中已是性比高的店唯一缺是交通不方便,The only lack of a high -sex shop in Jiangdi is the only lack of sexual transportation is inconvenient.
0,住了这么多五星级的酒店，还是第一次经历degrade！！！由于时间紧没能订上度假的房型，所有选了个高级间。晚上11点多去到酒店，安排了间烟味很大的双人间，因为本人讨厌吸烟，所有要求无言楼层或者换个没有烟味的房间，前台说马上安排。之后就是漫长的1个小时等待......最后终于忍不住打电话给前台，发现房间的电话是坏的，然后用手机打通，把要求再说了一次。过了十来分钟，有服务生说带我换房，然后把我带到一间更小的房间，由于没有烟味，我接受了。由于我和女朋友一起，所以房间原有的一个枕头根本不够用。给电话酒店管家部，说要求给多个枕头，这时候特别郁闷的事情发生了。管家部说由于我这个是标准单人间，所有如果要加枕头需要加钱,"After staying at so many five -star hotels, I still experienced Degrade for the first time!IntersectionIntersectionBecause the time that was not able to order on vacation was tight, all chose a high -level room.I went to the hotel at 11 o'clock in the evening and arranged a dual room with a lot of smoke, because I hate smoking, and I asked for a speechless floor or changed a room without a smoke. The front desk was arranged immediately.After that, I waited for a long one hour ... Finally, I couldn't help calling to the front desk and found that the phone in the room was bad, and then opened it with my mobile phone and said the request again.After ten minutes, some waiters said that they took me to change the house, and then took me to a smaller room. I accepted because there was no smoke smell.Because I was with my girlfriend, the original pillow in the room was not enough.Give the phone hotel housekeeper and say that it is required to give multiple pillows. At this time, the particularly depressed things happened.The housekeeper said that because I am a standard single person, all if you want to add pillows and need to add money"
1,购物选择入住是非常方便，酒店就连着海港城，但是房间一般，设施也很陈旧，早餐也非常一般，个人认为，香港最好的酒店早餐是数码港艾美酒店的。,"It is very convenient for shopping to choose from. The hotel is even in the port city, but the room is general, the facilities are also very old, and the breakfast is very average. Personally, the best hotel breakfast in Hong Kong is from the Emmy Hotel in the digital port."
1,作为酒店的老客户，恐怕以后要做另外的选择了――服务水平在下降，价格却一升再升，再这样下去，下次不会再入住了。,"As an old customer of the hotel, I am afraid that in the future, I have to make another choice -the level of service is declining, but the price rises again and again, and then I will not stay next time."
1,"房间还不错,服务很好,只是路还没修好,下次还会住.","The room is not bad, the service is very good, but the road has not been repaired, and I will live next time."

1,"环境相当好,很适合到那里渡假,软硬件设施都不错,我住的是小套房,房假也合理,就是早餐跟其它四星比差了点,下次到厦门还回继续住那里","The environment is quite good, it is very suitable for crossing the vacation there. The software and hardware facilities are good. I live in a small suite, and the room leave is also reasonable. That is, the breakfast is worse than the other four stars.

1,性价比非常好的酒店，无愧于星级，甚至比其他大城市的五星酒店更舒适！房间大，设施齐全，装修简约大器，美中不足是墙上的装饰画有点不入调；地理位置也不错，在朝阳路属于高开区比较繁华的路段，出门走一两分钟就有公交站，楼下就有不少可以吃东西的地方，附近还有KFC，总体来说入住非常满意！,"Hotels with very good price -performance performance are worthy of stars, even more comfortable than five -star hotels in other big cities!The room is large, the facilities are complete, the decoration is simple and large, and the disadvantages of the beauty are the decorative paintings on the wall.There are many places to eat downstairs. There are also KFC nearby. Overall, I am very satisfied with staying!"
1,总的说来，富豪酒店是南昌市四星酒店中性价比最高的之一。地理位置比较方便，但是现在机场大巴只到洪城大市场了，去机场略有不便。,"In general, Rich Hotel is one of the highest cost performance of the four -star hotel in Nanchang.The geographical location is more convenient, but now the airport bus is only in the Hongcheng University market, and it is slightly inconvenient to go to the airport."
0,"先说说硬件设施。我住的是480元的经济套房，预订时我注明要无烟房。入住1109房间时，让我重新认识了什么叫套房，房间很暗很小，家具很旧，地毯很脏。特别是房间里的烟味非常刺鼻，难以忍受，立刻要求前台帮我换房间。但服务人员说要先到房间里来确认一下，好吧，我等。服务员来了，站在门口说“是有味道，但我觉得是木头的味道。”呵呵，不进屋就能闻到怪味，可想而知这味有多大！既不是新装修，用的也不是特殊木料，哪来的木头味道？我坚持换房间。于是换到同房型的409，没有味道了，OK。服务员带我看好房间，顺便帮我放好行李后，我就出门了。是服务员帮我关的门。晚上回来时，发现门打不开了！卡是对的，锁是打开了，但门就是推不开，无奈，踹了一脚总算开了。进了门，又犯愁了，门关不上！仔细看了才明白是与门框太紧了，于是又踹上。第2天早上又费了九牛二虎之力才开了门。卫生间也是很旧，毛巾很旧都发灰色了。一开洗脸盆的冷水龙头，就会发出发动机一般的巨响，吓得立刻关掉。在说说服务，我是一人入住，却给了2张早餐券。早餐是到10点结束，但9点时已经很多种类没有了。品种也很少。餐桌上放的是一双筷子和一个调羹，没有刀叉，很不方便。退房时顺便把剩下的那张餐券还给了前台，正好大堂经理过来询问入住情况，我就说按入住人数给餐券就可以了呀。大堂经理很委屈地说“您住的是大床房，我们都给2张券。这是我们的服务”。一下子还反应不过来，但联系到房间里那台莫名的收费成人节目后，恍然大悟。可惜我是来出差的，不是来娱乐的。补充点评2008年8月3日：只能说服务人员的热情是可以打高分的，但服务水平很一般，房间的设施实在太差。房间里居然没有小冰箱，提供的不是瓶装水，是大的桶装水，不是很敢喝。我是看了诸位的评价后才下定决心订这酒店的，但太失望了，很怀疑这些高分是怎么评出来的。宾馆反馈2008年8月13日：尊敬的先生：（请允许我们这样称呼您，因您入住时的姓名与宾客意见反馈姓名不一致）。非常感谢您的留言及对酒店提出的宝贵意见。对于您所指出的关于本酒店的各类硬件问题,酒店方已有计划将于年底对客房及相关设施进行装修；同时对于酒店服务方面等出现的问题,已引起酒店高层的高度关注,酒店方将对于此事进行彻底调查,并对相关员工做出相应处理,同时酒店方会对员工进行各方面的培训,加强服务意识,提高服务品质；希望下次有机会为您提供更优质的服务。我们已把您的信息存入客史资料，下次入住时我们会提供个性化服务。最后,再次感谢您对本酒店提出的各种建议，以便于我们更好的为客人服务，提高总体服务品质。","Let's talk about hardware facilities first.I live in an economic suite of 480 yuan. When I book, I indicate that I want a smokeless house.When I stayed in Room 1109, let me re -know what is a suite. The room was very dark and small, the furniture was old, and the carpet was dirty.Especially the smoke smell in the room is very pungent and unbearable. Immediately asked the front desk to help me change the room.But the service staff said that you should go to the room to confirm, okay, I wait.The waiter came, standing at the door and saying, ""It has a taste, but I think it's the taste of wood."" Oh, you can smell the strange smell without entering the house.It is neither new decoration, nor special wood is used. Where does the wood taste?I insist on changing the room.So I changed to the same room 409, which was not tasteful, ok.The waiter took me to the room, and after helping me put my luggage by the way, I went out.It is the door to help me.When I came back at night, I found that the door could not be opened!The card was right, the lock was opened, but the door could not be pushed open. Helplessly, I opened it and finally opened it.After entering the door, I was worried again, and the door could not be closed!After reading it carefully, I realized that it was too tight to the door frame, so I kicked again.On the morning of the 2nd morning, the strength of Nine Niu and Tiger opened the door.The bathroom is also very old, and the towels are very gray.As soon as the cold water faucet of the washbasin is opened, the engine -like sound will be made, which is scared immediately.Talking about the service, I am one -person, but I gave 2 breakfast coupons.The breakfast ended at 10 o'clock, but there were many types of types at 9 o'clock.There are very few varieties.There is a pair of chopsticks and a pupa on the dining table. It is not convenient to have no knife and fork.By the way, the rest of the meal coupon was returned to the front desk by the way. It happened that the lobby manager came over to ask about the situation.The lobby manager said aggrieved, ""You live in a large bed, we all give 2 vouchers. This is our service.""Suddenly, he couldn't respond, but after contacting the inexplicable toll adult show in the room, he suddenly realized.Unfortunately, I came to a business trip, not for entertainment.Supplementary comment on August 3, 2008: It can only be said that the enthusiasm of the service staff can score high, but the service level is very average, and the facilities in the room are too bad.There is no small refrigerator in the room. It is not bottle water, but a large barrel water, not very dare to drink.I was determined to book this hotel after watching the evaluation of you, but I was so disappointed that I doubted how these high scores were evaluated.Hotel feedback on August 13, 2008: Dear Mr.: (Please allow us to call you like this, because the names of your time in your stay are inconsistent with the feedback names of guests).Thank you very much for your message and your valuable opinions on the hotel.Regarding the various hardware problems of the hotel you pointed out, the hotel has plans to decorate the guest rooms and related facilities at the end of the year. At the same timeA thorough investigation of this matter and handling relevant employees should be dealt with accordingly. At the same time, the hotel will conduct all aspects of training to employees, strengthen service awareness, and improve service quality; I hope that the next time I will have the opportunity to provide you with better services.We have stored your information into the history of customer history, and we will provide personalized services next time.Finally, thank you again for your various suggestions on the hotel to facilitate us to better serve customers and improve overall service quality."
1,入住的是贵宾楼，房间面积还算大，感觉硬件和服务都还不错。缺点是隔音效果不是很好，住隔壁的同事说竟然能听到我打电话的声音，而且走廊上其他客人的声音也吵醒过我2次。,"The VIP building is staying in. The area of the room is quite large, and the hardware and services are not bad.The disadvantage is that the sound insulation effect is not very good. The colleagues living next door said that they could hear the sound of my call, and the voice of other guests in the corridor also woke me twice."

0,位置不很方便，周围乱哄哄的，卫生条件也不如其他如家的店。以后绝不会再住在这里。,"The location is not very convenient, the surrounding is chaotic, and the sanitary conditions are not as good as other shops.I will never live here again."
0,该酒店新开业，各方面都不完善。携程上介绍的东西很多都没有，包括电视节目，居然没有一个海外节目，国内电视节目也很少。结帐的时候，居然因为餐厅有笔帐单重复计算，让我等了足足有半小时。很需要改进！在商务中心，我希望能用自己的笔记本电脑上网，也同意按照他们要求的一小时20元的价格，但一开始服务人员不同意我用自己的电脑上网，后经一貌似经理的人询问，说是可以，但令我气愤的是，那位经理很严肃的和我,"The hotel is newly opened, and all aspects are not perfect.There are many things introduced on Ctrip, including TV shows. There is no overseas program, and there are very few domestic TV shows.At the time of checkout, because the restaurant had a strokes repeatedly calculated, I waited for half an hour.Need to improve!At the business center, I hope to use my own laptop computer to surf the Internet, and I also agree that the price of 20 yuan for an hour at the one he requires, but at the beginning, the service staff did not agree that I used my computer to access the Internet. The later person who seemed to be the manager asked.It is OK, but what makes me angry is that the manager is very serious with me"
0,该酒店卫生情况较差，特别是早晨6点多，我听到卫生间有两只老鼠在嘶叫，感觉特别差，硬件设施与价格不符，失望，太令人失望,"The hotel's hygiene is poor, especially at 6 o'clock in the morning. I heard that there were two mice screaming in the bathroom. It felt particularly poor. The hardware facilities did not match the price."
1,服务值得褒奖，是见过的国营酒店里最好的，尤其是行政楼层长兴阁，贴心的服务，精致的点心，无线上网，免费的下午茶，感觉很惬意，尤其是服务员的素质，蔡雪妹妹的微笑实在让人难忘。大堂吧也不错。行政楼层1030一晚，含免费下午茶（长兴阁），每天免费洗烫4件衣服，免费享用4瓶小冰箱饮料，含早餐。性价比相当不错。好话说了这么多，批评一下：主楼和世纪楼的中餐厅真的很烂，据说是外包的，生意非常火，每天都是婚宴，要吃饭必须定位，否则排队吓死人。住了一个星期，两个中餐厅分别等到机会吃了一把，差点没被气晕过去。素质和环境和酒店本身相差太远，吵闹，难吃，奇贵无比，拿着红酒杯倒啤酒，拿着洋酒杯到红酒，厉害！服务员素质也不到位，和外面马路餐厅相当。酒店里两家中餐厅外包，天上人间也总会外包，都极差。日本料理店东西不新鲜，早餐每天都一样，只有鸡肉粥换成鱼片粥，呵呵，吃顿早饭吗，不用那么挑剔，也罢。4楼健身不错，很全，保健按摩很专业。总体来说，性价比不错，切记只选酒店自有的服务，准没错，外包的别再尝试了，只会影响心情。,"The service is worthy of praise. It is the best state -owned hotel that has been seen, especially Changxing Pavilion, administrative floor, intimate service, exquisite snacks, wireless online, free afternoon tea, which feels very comfortable, especially the quality of the waiter, Cai Xue's quality, Cai XueSister's smile is really memorable.The lobby is also good.The administrative floor is 1030 a night, including free afternoon tea (Changxing Pavilion). Wash 4 clothes for free every day and enjoy 4 bottles of small refrigerator drinks for free, including breakfast.The cost performance is quite good.I have said so much, criticize: The Chinese restaurants in the main building and the Century Building are really bad. It is said to be outsourced. The business is very hot. It is a wedding banquet every day. You must locate to eat, otherwise you will be scared to death.After staying for a week, the two Chinese restaurants waited for the opportunity to eat one, and almost didn't be fainted.The quality and environment are too far away from the hotel itself, noisy, unpalatable, unusual, pour beer holding red wine glass, holding wine glass to red wine, great!The quality of the waiter is not in place, which is equivalent to the road restaurant outside.The two Chinese restaurants in the hotel are outsourced, and the world will always outsourcing, which is extremely poor.Japanese restaurants are not fresh. Breakfast is the same every day. Only chicken porridge is replaced with fish porridge. Hehe, do you eat breakfast, do n’t be so picky.Fitness on the 4th floor is good, very complete, health massage is very professional.In general, the cost -effectiveness is good. Remember to only choose the hotel's own services. It is right. Don't try out of outsourcing, it will only affect your mood."

1,在莱西这个地方真的算是不错的酒店了。酒店临河，不在闹市区，环境好。晚上酒店里有唱歌的，不过也不会唱到很晚，11点左右就差不多了。,"This place is really a good hotel in Laici.The hotel is near the river, and the environment is not in the downtown area. The environment is good.There are singing in the hotel in the evening, but it will not sing very late, and it is almost about 11 o'clock."

1,住的是8楼豪海房，每天就在海边度过，一个字，爽！酒店服务不错，路上遇见都会微笑问好，早餐还算丰富，而且到11点，可以一起解决午餐问题。大堂很有特色，喜欢，还有它家的沙滩拖鞋很舒服，想买双回家，就是不对外卖。房间有点陈旧，床很舒服，上网费用高了点。一点小问题时浴室淋浴房的下面封条有漏水，害得上厕所都会有影响，鞋子湿湿的，要用毛巾垫着才行，和客房服务提出后也几天也没有解决。,"I live in the Haohai House on the 8th floor, and I spent every day at the beach, one word, cool!The hotel service is good. When you meet on the road, you will smile and ask well. Breakfast is rich, and at 11 o'clock, you can solve the lunch problem together.The lobby is very distinctive. I like it, and its beach slippers are very comfortable. If you want to buy double home, you do n’t takeaway.The room is a bit old, the bed is very comfortable, and the cost of Internet access is a bit higher.When a small problem is a small problem, the sealing of the bathroom shower room is leaked, which will affect the toilet. The shoes will be wet. You must use a towel to put it. It will not be resolved for a few days after the guest room service is proposed."
1,可能对香港人来说也是一个新的娱乐场所。酒店设施服务都一流，位置方便，周围有许留山、7－11超市、沙沙、买电子产品、波鞋等都近在咫尺，旺角地铁站，弥敦道也分布在酒店出口处。我和女儿结束迪斯尼的游玩后在那里连住3晚，对我们自助游的人来说还算方便的。从酒店到太空馆、海洋公园、中环等都很快，酒店旁边的集市有买山竹10元4磅，很好吃，我们还一直带回到上海呢！,"It may also be a new entertainment place for Hong Kong people.Hotel facilities are first -rate and convenient. There are Xu Liushan, 7-11 supermarkets, rustling, buying electronic products, and shoes around them. Mong Kok Metro Station is also distributed at the hotel exit.My daughter and I lived there for 3 nights after Disney's play, which is pretty convenient for those who travel by self -guided tour.From the hotel to the space hall, marine park, Central, etc., the market next to the hotel has 10 yuan and 4 pounds to buy mangosteen. It is delicious. We have been bringing back to Shanghai!"
1,酒店就在海水浴场旁边，出门到接触到海水两分钟，如果要和海水亲近的朋友，极力推荐。这样游泳换衣服啥的就很方便了。山景房是朝马路的一边，便宜点，海景房是可以看到海的。房间很大。40个平方左右。条件不错。没有叫服务员弄一些端吃的上来之类的事情。反正登记和结账的时候态度还不错。我要求不高，可以看电视上网就好。一楼还有台球桌。本来说不要钱可以玩得，还是要了我们30块，出来玩也不想弄不开心，给他们了。到市区就打车好了，威海的taxi很便宜，从这里到市区最多17块钱。旁边的沙滩真不错，免费，金黄色的沙滩，碧绿的海水，很好。有一点有点遗憾，就是第一天去的时候洗澡的热水有点问题，黄黄的，不知道是锈迹还是什么。不过第二天就好了。补充点评2007年10月6日：看了下面朋友们的推荐，补充一下，确实离4星级有差距，我也没有看到前台那有4星的评定级别，只是从他们的自我介绍中说是按照4星级配置。服务员素质一般，没有那种很主动和热情的态度。另外还有一件事情，不让把浴巾等带到浴场，去游泳的朋友还是得自己准备浴巾。我准备很不充分，打赤脚去游泳，经过大厅的时候有个穿制服的服务员模样的人跟我说不让打赤脚进大厅，我说你们又不让把房间的鞋子(其实也就是一次次性的鞋拖)穿出去，也不给配备双沙滩拖鞋，我出来住酒店总不能自己带双拖鞋来吧，那人才闭嘴。所以建议酒店放两双沙滩拖鞋在房间，花不了几个钱但是非常实用。鉴于我对酒店总体要求不高，总的评价偏高，希望对别的朋友有用！,"The hotel is next to the seawater bath. When you go out to contact the seawater for two minutes, if you want to be close to the sea water, you will highlight it.This way swimming changing clothes is very convenient.The mountain view room is the side of the road, cheaper, the sea view room can be seen in the sea.The room is large.About 40 square meters.Good conditions.There are no things like waiters to get some foods.Anyway, the attitude is good when registering and checking out.I do n’t ask for high, just watch TV online.There are also tables on the first floor.Originally, I did n’t have money to play. I still asked us 30 yuan. I did n’t want to be unhappy when I came out to play.I took a taxi in the urban area. The TAXI in Weihai was very cheap. From here to the urban area, it was up to 17 yuan.The beach next to it is really good, free, golden beaches, green sea water, very good.There is a little regret, that is, there is a problem with the hot water of bathing when I go on the first day. Huanghuang, I do n’t know if it is rust or what.But the next day is fine.Supplementary comment on October 6, 2007: After watching the recommendations of the friends below, adding it, there is indeed a gap between 4 stars, and I did not see the level of 4 stars in the front desk, but I just said from their self -introduction.It is configured by 4 -star.The quality of the waiter is average, and there is no active and enthusiastic attitude.There is also one thing to prevent the bath towels from being taken to the bath. Friends who go swimming have to prepare the bath towel by themselves.I was inadequate to prepare. I went to swimming barefoot. When I passed the hall, a waiter who was wearing a uniform told me that I would not let barefoot enter the lobby. I said that you would not let the shoes of the room (in fact, that is, again and againSex shoe sideways) Wear out, and do not provide double beach slippers. I ca n’t bring double slippers by myself when I come out to live in the hotel. The man closed his mouth.Therefore, it is recommended that the hotel put two pairs of beach slippers in the room. It can't cost a few dollars but it is very practical.Given that my overall requirements for the hotel are not high, my total evaluation is high, I hope it is useful to other friends!"
1,"硬件很好,服务质量也很好,特别是酒店周围环境非常优雅.早餐也不错,下次去还会入住","The hardware is very good and the quality of the service is also very good, especially the surrounding environment is very elegant. Breakfast is also good. I will stay in the next time"
0,位置尚可，离孔府孔庙很近，可以步行过去。环境太差，服务员素质很差，房间连衣架都没有。价格没有吸引力，比相距20米的国际青年旅舍差的太远，那里不仅价格便宜，而且卫生整洁，可以结认一些自助游的同行人，还可以自助洗衣。建议携程取消对该酒店的合作，影响携程的声誉。,"The location is acceptable, it is very close to the Confucian Temple of Confucius, you can walk.The environment is too poor, the quality of the waiter is very poor, and there is no hanger in the room.The price is not attractive. It is too far away from the international youth hostel 20 meters apart. Not only is the price cheap, but also hygiene and neat. You can recognize some self -guided peers, and you can also do it.It is recommended that Ctrip cancel cooperation with the hotel and affect Ctrip's reputation."
1,"酒店的位置很好,距离火车站非常近.总提感觉酒店的性价比不错,房间不是很大,但是对于出公差来说,也是十分不错的选择了.","The hotel's location is very good, which is very close to the train station. It always feels that the hotel's cost performance is good, and the room is not very large, but it is also a very good choice for tolerances."
1,庐山宾馆是一个值得再去住的酒店，服务非常好．但一个小细节影响了评分，这个问题好多网友都提过，不知道酒店为何一直不改进．就是生活用纸的质量太差了．房间的纸差算了，餐厅里的连卫生纸都不如，实在想不通！！！,"Lushan Hotel is a hotel worth living again, and the service is very good.But a small detail affects the score. Many netizens have mentioned this question. I don't know why the hotel has not improved.That is, the quality of domestic paper is too poor.The paper in the room is counted, and even the toilet paper in the restaurant is not as good as it, I really can't figure it out!IntersectionIntersection"
1,宝晖酒店离机场比较近，不用到罗湖一带找酒店了酒店大堂和餐厅等装璜都挺漂亮的，很有特色的古雅，服务人员也很不错，热情周到，这点没什么挑剔但是，内在客房设施不大满意我住的行政房间，居然在写字台附近没有插座！这样有宽带又有什么用？只好把电视机柜挪开才能给电脑充电，真不方便其他设备也比较缺，比如小冰箱、箱包架（后来发现藏在衣柜里了）、面巾纸盒、咖啡...还有一点似乎不够人性化，离开房间拔掉房卡，房间是马上断电的立刻漆黑的一团，如果是CheckOut拖着大包小包更是不方便。很多酒店是拔掉房卡后有10秒到甚至一分钟的延迟才断电，建议借鉴一下,"Baohui Hotel is closer to the airport. It is not necessary to find a hotel lobby and restaurant in Luohu. The decorations such as the hotel lobby and restaurant are very beautiful. The service staff are very good and passionate.The facility is not very satisfied with the administrative room I live in. There is no socket near the writing desk!What is the use of broadband like this?You have to move the TV cabinet to charge the computer. It is really inconvenient to be lacking in other devices, such as small refrigerators, luggage frames (later found that it is hidden in the wardrobe), face towel boxes, coffee ... and it seems that it is not human enough to be humanized enough, Leaving the room to unplug the room card, the room was immediately darkened. It would be inconvenient to drag a large bag with Checkout.Many hotels have a delay from 10 seconds to or even a minute after unplugging the room card. It is recommended to learn from"
0,南阳就只有这两个酒店可以选择，另外一个东方比较远建国在市中心，交通方便，但硬件不如金凯悦，靠路边比较吵在建国系酒店算是比较差的了补充点评2008年5月4日：补充一下，虽然硬件不怎么样，但服务人员尤其前台很专业，给人的感觉很舒服,"There are only these two hotels in Nanyang to choose from. Another Dongfang is relatively far away from the city center. It is convenient to transport, but the hardware is not as good as Kim Hyatt.: In addition, although the hardware is not good, the service staff, especially the front desk is very professional, gives people a very comfortable feeling"
1,酒店正在申定五星中，不过目前看来四星都有点勉强。大堂很气派，不过细节很粗糙。硬件需要加强。服务人员礼貌热情。酒店的房间和早餐都还不错。,"The hotel is applying for five stars, but it seems that the four stars are a bit reluctant.The lobby is very elegant, but the details are rough.Hardware needs to be strengthened.The service staff is polite and enthusiastic.The hotel's rooms and breakfast are pretty good."
0,入住的时候刚装修，味道很浓！房间内的床坐上去好像有点不稳！,"I just renovated when I stayed, and the taste was very strong!The bed in the room seems a bit unstable!"
1,我是这个月初入住的。订房前也看了一些点评，尤其是对点评上说的“热水少、网速慢”的问题心有余悸，但出于其地理位置好，且房价合适，于是还是在朋友的教唆下定了这家酒店。刚到敦煌时才发现在如此小的城市中无所谓地点便利之说，在敦煌的2天没打过车，都是走路的。所以说其地理条件优越之说，其实也显得不是很重要了。说说服务吧。去前台checkin的时候，刚说是通过携程预定的，马上服务人员就说出了我的姓名，第一反应：这里服务对应的真快；第二反应：大概客人极少。在前台人员的提醒下注意了大厅里的滚动屏幕，上面居然写着：“欢迎**一行入住我店……”的大字，感觉很是亲切，顿时心里美滋滋的。进入房间，感觉还可以，比九寨沟的同级别酒店好多了。而且这里和北京一样也有数字电视了。朋友下午洗了个澡，说是水非常热，水量也很大，反映不错。想：大概是做了改善了吧。晚上打算就论坛中的“热水和网速”问题亲自碰碰运气，7点半打开水龙头，半天没热水？！！都说敦煌缺水，偶也不好意思这么大肆的放水啊，放了2分钟还没有热水，放弃！心想：早知道下午洗就好了，后悔啊。上网再看看吧，想登录我的YAHOO邮箱，从晚7点40分到11点也没有进去，晕啊~！看来网上点评的很是客观阿。这时朋友告诉我：现在来热水了。可惜偶已经渐进梦乡了。另外早点，由于是淡季宾馆里没什么人入住，所以餐厅停业，也就不提供早餐了。不过敦煌地小，到处都是小馆子，不愁没得吃。总体来说，服务不错，都是笑脸相迎。地点还可以，门口就有去莫高窟的中巴。如果能把热水和网速这两个瓶颈问题解决掉，就更好了。,"I stayed at the beginning of the month.I also read some reviews before booking, especially the problem of ""less hot water and slow internet speed"" mentioned in the review, but because of its good geographical location and suitable house prices, I still set up this one under the instability of my friends.hotel.When I arrived at Dunhuang, I found that in such a small city, it was convenient to say that it was convenient to walk in Dunhuang for 2 days, and they all walked.Therefore, its geographical conditions are superior, but it is actually not very important.Talk about the service.When I went to checkin at the front desk, I just said that it was booked through Ctrip, and the service staff immediately said my name. The first reaction: Here the service here is really fast; the second reaction: probably very few guests.Under the reminder of the front desk staff, he paid attention to the rolling screen in the hall, which actually read: ""Welcome ** to stay in my shop ..."", it feels very kind and suddenly feels beautiful.Entering the room, it feels okay, much better than the hotel in Jiuzhaigou.And there are digital TVs like Beijing here.My friend took a bath in the afternoon and said that the water was very hot, the water volume was very large, and it reflected good.Think: probably improved.In the evening, I planned to touch the ""hot water and network speed"" problem in the forum in the evening. Open the faucet at 7:30, and have no hot water for a long time?IntersectionIntersectionIt is said that Dunhuang is short of water, and I am embarrassed to put the water so much. After 2 minutes, there is no hot water, give up!I thought: I knew it would be fine in the afternoon, regret it.Take a look at the Internet. I want to log in to my Yahoo mailbox. I did n’t go in from 7:40 pm to 11:00, dizzy ~!It seems that the online comments are very objective.At this time, my friend told me: Now it's hot water.Unfortunately, I have gradually entered the dream hometown.In addition, because there was no one in the off -season hotel, the restaurant stopped the business without providing breakfast.However, Dunhuang is small and there are small restaurants everywhere.Overall, the service is good, and they are smiling.The location is ok, there is a China -Pakistan to go to Mogao Grottoes at the door.It would be better if you can solve the two bottleneck problems of hot water and network speed."
1,"五一节后因为商务活动入住了这家酒店.自我感觉还很不错.虽然不能和大城市的四星级酒店相比.但是这里的设施和服务和我在大城市入住的四星级酒店相比不相上下.酒店里的免费早餐品种也很丰富.我在大概的数了一下.有五十多个品种.非常满意.客房里的设施非常的干净和舒适．我住的是数字化客房，有电脑，免费宽带，速度很快，而且国内长途免费拨打。不错的酒店，性价比较高。总之,不错，不错.","After May Day, I stayed in this hotel because of business activities. The self -feelings are still very good. Although I can't compare with the four -star hotels in the big city.

It is not easy to find, but it doesn't matter if you drive. It seems that the road of Guangyuan is too difficult to find. For example, I went to Huangze Temple.Then, then"
0,"非常差的一家酒店,虽然前台小姐开房时对你郑重声明是""二星级"".进门,房间里一股味道扑面而来,往墙上插卡取电?没用,干脆直接按电钮开灯;进卫生间洗澡打开水龙头,水竟然从管子里喷出来,仔细一看,原来淋浴器的管子和龙头部位已经断裂成两部分,酒店用黑胶布简单的绑在一起;好不容易洗完,离开卫生间,突然听到里面轰隆声大作,吓了一跳,再一看原来是楼上冲马桶的声音,当然这种声音一晚上持续不断---只要楼上在用卫生间.好不容易过了一晚,早上起来打餐厅电话订早餐,被告知不送房间,要送就要收手续费;终于出门要退房了,一开门地上好大一滩水,原来夜里下雨,走廊里竟然漏雨漏了大半夜.终于退了房,外面又下起雨来,向前台小姐要求用伞送一段三分钟的路去旁边的北海汽车站,竟被告知要自己去求保安,恳求了半天才慢吞吞地去安排;最后耐不住饥饿去二楼的餐厅吃饭,一份又硬又难吃的炒饭卖18块也就算了,送餐时往桌上扔了一包餐巾纸,立马就要收你两块钱.---一分钱也不愿意再施舍给这家破酒店了---出得了这笔钱,俺们受不了这笔气啊---在桂林住80块的宾馆都比这好多了......","A very poor hotel, although the front desk lady solemnly stated to you as ""two -star"".

1,非常不错的酒店，外观一般，不过对面就是皮革城，相信很多人都去购物了吧。酒店还主动给女同事换了圆床房，算是意外吧，不过可能最近是淡季吧，总的感觉不错，下次可以继续住。补充点评2008年4月1日：最近携城的员工越来越多的犯错误，非常不专业。很多以前可以预定的酒店也没有了，预定的价格似乎更小了，是不是携程被收购的原因，有问题啊。,"Very good hotel, the appearance is average, but the opposite is the leather city. I believe many people go shopping.The hotel also took the initiative to change the round bed room for female colleagues. It is an accident, but it may be the off -season recently. The general feeling is good. I can continue to live next time.Supplementary comment on April 1, 2008: More and more employees who have recently carried the city made mistakes and were very unprofessional.Many hotels that can be booked before are gone. The scheduled price seems to be smaller. Is there a problem for Ctrip?"
0,优点：地处繁华，服务员很友好。缺点：因为靠马路，晚上很吵，一夜没睡好。第二天中午回到房间，发现居然没打扫房间。宾馆反馈2008年8月13日：感谢您选择入住西湖四季酒店。对您此次入住的不愉快酒店深表歉意，若您对客房清理的时间有一定的要求，请拨打房间内座机上的一键通，前台会通知管家部及时给您的房间进行打扫。感谢您的点评，并期待您的再次光临！,"Advantages: Located in prosperity, the waiter is very friendly.Disadvantages: Because of the road, it is very noisy at night and did not sleep well overnight.I returned to the room at noon the next day and found that the room was not cleaned.Hotel feedback on August 13, 2008: Thank you for choosing to stay at the West Lake Four Seasons Hotel.I apologize to the unpleasant hotel you stayed in this time. If you have certain requirements for the time to clean the rooms, please call the one -click pass on the seat machine in the room. The front desk will notify the housekeeper to clean your room in time.Thank you for your comment and look forward to your visit again!"
1,酒店服务态度绝对是好的，大堂小姐会提醒天冷加衣服，早餐的时候主动为客户提供及时周到的服务，很不错。但是酒店装修一般，还有隔音效果不好。不过总的来说还是比较满意的，至少在我已经住过的酒店当中算是好的了。,"The hotel service attitude is absolutely good. Miss Hall will remind Tian Leng to add clothes. During breakfast, it takes the initiative to provide customers with timely and thoughtful services. It is very good.However, the hotel decoration is average, and the sound insulation effect is not good.However, in general, it is relatively satisfactory, at least among the hotels I have lived."
0,没有比这更差的酒店了。房间灯光暗淡，空调无法调节，前台服务僵化。用早餐时，服务员居然叫我回房间把拖鞋换成皮鞋再下来，到底谁是上帝，这家酒店的老总应该马上辞职。建议大家不要住这家酒店，有被骗的感觉！,"There is no worse hotel than this.The room lights are dim, the air conditioner cannot be adjusted, and the front desk service is rigid.During breakfast, the waiter actually told me to return to the room to replace slippers with leather shoes. Who is God, the boss of this hotel should resign immediately.It is recommended that you do n’t live in this hotel. It feels deceived!"

1,是苏州数一数二的酒店，位置不错，早上还有很多出租车等客人，很方便。服务非常好！很贴心！我到店比较晚了，前台帮忙免费升级到了行政楼层的套房，窗外景色非常好，还有欢迎水果。走的时候赶时间，礼宾部的人站在大太阳底下帮忙叫车，很不错！赞一个！推荐！下次还会入住！！,"It is one of the best hotels in Suzhou, with a good location. There are many taxis and other guests in the morning, which is very convenient.The service is very good!Very intimate!I went to the store late. The front desk helped to upgrade to the suite of the administrative floor for free.

It is very good!give it a like!recommend!I will stay next time!Intersection"
1,在常州还是很不错，性价比很高的酒店。地理位置很好，离火车站就5分钟的车程。酒店有一定历史了，设施稍有陈旧感，但服务很不错，每天会有服务员送上报纸，现在偶尔也送上小点心。生日的时候会送花。呵呵。其实对男士来说，不如送点水果比较实在。呵呵，是不是太过苛刻了。,"It is still very good in Changzhou, and it is very cost -effective.The geographical location is very good, 5 minutes away from the train station.The hotel has a certain history, the facilities are slightly old, but the service is very good. Every day, the waiter will send the newspaper, and now occasionally send a snack.You will send flowers on your birthday.hehe.In fact, for men, it is better to get some fruits.Hehe, isn't it too harsh?"
0,好小的门面，没有电梯，房间也不是很一致！最郁闷的是我不知道我们公司跟他们有合约，他就让我的客人（另外一次）直接用我们公司的名义住的酒店，而没有通过ctrip。还好第二天ctrip打电话给我确认，让我退单了。,"The small facade, without an elevator, the room is not the same!The most depressed thing is that I don't know that our company has a contract with them, so he let my guests (another time) live directly in the name of our company's name, without passing CTRIP.Fortunately, Ctrip called me to confirm the next day, and let me retreat."
0,上月入住，将近500元一天的房费，卫生间很小，像经济性酒店。走廊房间一股霉味。浴缸下水管漏水，淌的一地都是。窗户外面不到30米就是居民小区，喇叭不断。更可笑的是，结账时被告知，携程预定的房费是不含服务费的，又多收了10%的服务费。在携程定了这么多次，五星也订很多了，还是头一次遇到。总之，酒店差，房费不合理！,"Last month, nearly 500 yuan a day's room fee, the bathroom was small, like an economical hotel.The corridor room has a moldy smell.The bathtub's water pipe leaked, and the place was flowing.Less than 30 meters outside the window are residential communities, and the horn is constantly.What's even more ridiculous is that at the time of checkout, I was informed that Ctrip's predetermined room fee did not include service fees, and they charged 10%of the service fee.After so many times in Ctrip, the five -star booked a lot, it was the first time I met.In short, the hotel is poor and the house fee is unreasonable!"

0,峨眉山的确很美，宾馆所处位置也很好，闹中取静是真的。但是宾馆本身设施也就2星水准，房间很普通，象旅馆。刚进去的时候所有廊灯都是关的，一面靠山而建，一进去就是五楼，下面四层其实都是地下，很暗。感觉不舒服的是领我们进去的是个瘦男，光头，像个混黑道的。和朋友出去找吃的，仔细留意一下，空空的大堂里始终坐着几个象打手的人，怕怕的。一个宾馆没遇到几个住宿的人，晚些时候和朋友商量还是退房换宾馆比较好，总比夜半敲门送客来，客走被人敲的好。服务员服务态度很懒散，宾馆停车还要收费，爱停不停。感觉很不好！和朋友商量，立马退房换住红蛛山宾馆，每间只贵200元左右，可是那才真正正规的5星，很舒服。很不明白的是，打电话到携程预定的时候，携程工作人员竟然说峨嵋只有这家是协议酒店，当地人200元就住的酒店，携程要400多。上携程一查，红蛛山不也是协议酒店吗，为何不推荐？,"Mount Emei is indeed beautiful, the hotel is also very good, and it is true to take quietness in trouble.However, the hotel itself is only 2 stars. The room is very ordinary, like a hotel.When I first entered, all gallery lights were closed. They were built on the one hand. As soon as they entered, the fifth floor was actually underground, which was actually dark.It feels uncomfortable that it is a thin man who leads us in, bald head, like a mixed underworld.When you go out with friends to find food, pay close attention, always sitting in the empty lobby always sitting on a few people with fighters, afraid.A hotel does not meet a few accommodations. It is better to discuss with friends at the time of discussing with friends. It is better than knocking on the door in the middle of the night.The waiter's service attitude is very lazy, and the hotel has to charge for parking.It feels bad!Discuss with friends, and immediately check out to change the Red Spider Mountain Hotel. Each is only about 200 yuan for each, but that is a real 5 star, which is very comfortable.It is not understood that when Ctrip's booking was called, Ctrip staff said that only Emei was an agreement hotel. The locals stayed at the hotel 200 yuan, and Ctrip wanted more than 400.As soon as I checked, isn't the Red Spider Mountain also an Agreement Hotel? Why not recommend it?"
1,泰和楼的高级标准间（就是288的那种）住在16楼了，还是吵，车辆来往噪音大。不过地理位置真的很好，去哪都很方便。房间也很好。,"The senior standard room (that is, the type of 288) of Taihe Lou has lived on the 16th floor. It is still noisy. The vehicle has a lot of noise.But the geographical location is really good, it is convenient to go anywhere.The room is also very good."

1,整体的情况很好。对酒店方面提一个意见，就是酒店的空调好像有些南方的气候一样，太潮湿了。可能使空调系统的问题，望能改进。,"The overall situation is very good.Make a opinion on the hotel, that is, the hotel's air conditioner seems to have some climate in the south, which is too humid.The problem of the air -conditioning system may be improved."
1,各方面的准基本达到五星的标准，不过，每个城市的五星酒店基本都是万变不离其宗。房间：较大，特点是枕头极多，初步点了一下，一个床上有九个枕头。窗外的视线也不错，朝东的房间可以远眺金鸡湖。卫生间：较大，舒服。会议室：这次租用了半天的会议室，价格虽然很贵，但是基本设施和服务还是很到位的，酒店在从大堂开始到电梯到二楼的电梯口到会议室，沿途到进行了告示，老板看了感到很有面子。总之：如果是会务安排，公务活动，这个酒店相当的不错。,"The accuracy in all aspects basically meets the standard of five -star, but the five -star hotels in each city are basically changing.Room: Large, characteristic is that there are many pillows, and you click on. There are nine pillows on a bed.The sight outside the window is also good. The east room can overlook the Jinji Lake.Bathroom: Large, comfortable.Conference room: The conference room for a long time was rented. Although the price is very expensive, the basic facilities and services are still in place.The boss felt very face -to -face.In short: If it is a conference arrangement and official activities, this hotel is quite good."
0,太令人失望了。通过携程预定的，应含双早，可是，总台没给餐券，餐厅要收每人10元，才上餐。浴室的龙头坏的，头天入住报修后，到第二天退房也没人修。浴帘脏得看不出本来的颜色。太差劲了。,"Too disappointing.Through Ctrip's booking, it should be included in the early morning. However, the main station did not give me the meal coupon, and the restaurant had to receive 10 yuan per person before serving.The faucet of the bathroom was broken. After the first day of the report, no one was repaired by the next day.The shower curtain is so dirty that it can't see the original color.It's too bad."
0,这家酒店对携程的客人有价格歧视，所以不建议大家入住。我们是8月8号入住的（当然入住前是通过携程预定的，价格是996元/天），入住当天前台说是498元/天，拉了2000块的信用卡预授权。10号下午7点我们结帐离店时前台接待说要按照996元/天的价格结帐（其间没有任何人通知过我们），理由是这个价格是携程给的，恰好在我们结帐前有客人入住前台给的价格就是498元/天，因为8：02的火车，无奈之下我们按照996元/天结帐走人。我们鄙视这种逻辑关系混乱的前台，你们的房价难道要靠携程来制定么？,"This hotel has price discrimination against Ctrip's guests, so it is not recommended that you stay in.We stayed on August 8th (of course, before check -in, it was booked through Ctrip, the price was 996 yuan/day), the front desk on the day of the stay said that it was 498 yuan/day, and the credit card was pre -authorized for 2,000 yuan.On the 10th on the 10th, we will pay at the front desk when we check out and leave the store that the price will be at the price of 996 yuan/day (no one has notified us in the meantime). The reason is that the price was given by Ctrip.The price given by guests at the front desk is 498 yuan/day, because of the 8:02 train, helplessly we will leave at 996 yuan/day.We despise the front desk where this logical relationship is chaotic. Does your house prices depend on Ctrip to formulate it?"
0,"2008，7，19，长沙国贸惊魂夜。我与同事入住后外出一个多小时间，两间房被陌生人轻易地通过前台接待“请”服务员擅自先后开门，贵重财物（电脑等）被盗。报警１１０，并有监控录像和笔录为证，相信人民警察能为民除害。国贸酒店＂引狼入室＂，玩忽职守，到目前为止没有一点真诚的道歉、赔偿损失的态度和行动。但事实能赖掉吗？法院见。唯一评价：＂黑店＂。ＣＴＲＩＰ也该反思了。宾馆反馈2008年8月6日：此事发生后,酒店第一时间报警.从目前掌握的资料来看,此事有几个疑点目前公安部门正在积极侦破,酒店在8月5日还和负责此事的王警官沟通过,虽然客人的心情我们能理解,但是事实情况和上面所表达的是有区别的,所有的监控资料和笔录都记录了客观事实,酒店会继续跟踪此事.","2008, 7, 19, Changsha Guomao was shocked.After staying with my colleagues, I went out for more than a small time. The two rooms were easily opened by strangers by receiving ""please"" waiters through the front desk.The alarm was 110, and there were monitoring videos and transcripts as evidence. I believe that people's police can remove harm to the people.The International Trade Hotel ""leads the wolf into the room"" and neglects his duties. So far, there is no sincere apology and attitude and actions to compensate the loss.But can the facts depend?See the court.The only evaluation: ""black shop"".CTRIP should also reflect.Hotel feedback on August 6, 2008: After the incident, the hotel reported the police as soon as possible. From the information currently held, there are several doubts about the public security department. At present, the public security department is actively detecting.Police Officer Wang Guan passed by this matter. Although the guest's mood can understand, the facts are different from the above. All the monitoring materials and transcripts record the objective facts. The hotel will continue to track the matter."
1,酒店邻近山脚，空气清新，闹市取静之处，清早起床看着窗外真有想去晨跑的感觉。临近香港的SOHO区，附近就有最长的电梯往来中环。尤其夜晚可以取阶漫步而下前往兰桂枋，一路上都是异国情调的各式餐厅及酒巴。喜欢小资的朋友就非常喜欢的了。缺点是交通不便，其中一次返回酒店时，害得我步行了近半个小时才东问西问回到住处。进出酒店最方便的交通工具是出租。酒店的接待服务没问题。,"The hotel is close to the foot of the mountain, the air is fresh, and the city is quiet. I get up early in the morning and watch the window. I really want to go in the morning.Near the SOHO district near Hong Kong, there are the longest elevators in Central.Especially at night, you can take a step strolling and go down to Lan Guizhen. Along the way, there are all kinds of restaurants and wines with exotic mood.Friends who like petty bourgeoisters like it very much.The disadvantage is that the traffic is inconvenient. When I returned to the hotel once, I walked for nearly half an hour before I asked to return to the residence.The most convenient means of transportation in and out of the hotel is to rent.The hotel's reception service is fine."
1,这次的套餐从总体来说还是比较满意的，房间面积比较大，热水也很大，服务场所也齐全，风景嘛~~因为天气太冷也没有出去看过。房间装饰比较陈旧，浴室没有玻璃门，空调白天几乎是没有的，晚上像是开了很暖和。那个温水游泳池水很冷几乎没有人，到了晚上游泳池也不开灯。总之，这个酒店作为五星级的酒店来说太节约了~~~,"This set meal is still relatively satisfactory in general. The room area is relatively large, the hot water is also large, the service venues are complete, and the scenery ~~ Because the weather is too cold, I have never seen it.The room decoration is relatively old. There is no glass door in the bathroom. The air conditioner is almost no during the day. It seems warm at night.The water swimming pool was very cold and almost no one, and at night, the swimming pool did not turn on the lights.In short, this hotel is too saved as a five -star hotel ~~~"
1,"房间设计讲究。设施较完备，为顾客着想。早餐有质量、有特色，很贴心。地理位置不错。楼内环境有待提高，比如地毯。另外，宣传的接机服务应保障。宾馆反馈2008年8月13日：感谢您的点评,今年年底淡季时地毯将全部更换,另接机服务我们承诺最晚时间22:30.请予以理解。谢谢！希望再次光临本客栈！","The room design is particular.The facilities are more complete and think for customers.Breakfast is quality, characteristic, and intimate.The geographical location is good.The environment in the building needs to be improved, such as carpets.In addition, the propaganda service service should be guaranteed.Hotel feedback on August 13, 2008: Thank you for your comments. At the end of this year, the carpets will be replaced in the off -season at the end of this year. We will promise to understand at the latest at the latest at 22:30. Please understand.Thanks!Hope to visit the Inn again!"
1,酒店员工的礼仪意识十分差！！堂堂一家准五星的前台工作人员，当着顾客的面大抠鼻屎，真是让人十分愤怒！在办理入住手续的时候，四名前台人员随意嬉笑，接听手机，散漫无礼！办理退房手续的时候，有名陈姓员工大庭广众下抠鼻孔，真是恶心！宾馆反馈2008年4月14日：感谢您对酒店提出宝贵的意见，酒店将加强对员工基本的礼貌礼节与仪容仪表培训，严格要求员工的当班制度，相信在您下次入住时，定能给您留下好的印象。,"The etiquette consciousness of hotel employees is very poor!IntersectionA quasi -five -star front desk worker, in front of the customer's noses, is really angry!When checking in the procedures, the four front desk staff laughed at will, answered mobile phones, and was rude!When checking out for check -up procedures, it is disgusting!Hotel feedback on April 14, 2008: Thank you for making valuable opinions on the hotel. The hotel will strengthen the basic courtesy and courtesy training of employees. Strictly require employees' class system.You leave a good impression."
0,该酒店服务极差（国营单位）。上周我刚刚回来。原本想去宋村漂流，结果被不负责任的服务员（方飞女士；叶君健，这厮都不敢告诉我他的名字，算不上老爷们！）完全弄错，而且还没有任何歉疚和改正的意思。在我们理论的同时，叶君健这厮还要耍蛮，愣要打人。这就是国营单位的现况！建议大家如果真是没有其他选择，千万不要到这里来，来一个，后悔一个！我算是前车之鉴吧！另外这里交通极不方便，出门需要到前台预定出租车，至少15元，比起市内的2元每人，贵太多了！宾馆反馈2008年8月7日：对于您在本酒店的遭遇我们再次向您表示抱歉。当时我们的工作人员因为宋村漂流给了您错误的信息而向您非常诚恳的道了歉，并对为担误了您宝贵的时间也给您合理的补偿，而且您也接受了我们工作人员另外给您安排的漂流，并非您所说的没有任何歉疚和改正的意思，更没有您所指的要打人的意思。但不管如何，是因为我们工作人员的失误让您在我们饭店感觉到了不愉快，我们再次报以诚挚的歉意。我们将在员工的服务质量和服务素质上加强管理与培训，可以更好为客人服务。另外由于饭店是一家独立的度假型酒店，并不在闹市区（离市区的距离约在三分钟的车程，）地处千岛湖边的的半山腰上，所以出租车是需要按包车算的（从市区到假日10元/辆，从假日到市区因为需要预订故是15元/辆，市区的2元/人是指在固定线路的价格，可同时载不同的客人）。,"The hotel's service is extremely poor (state -owned unit).I just came back last week.Originally, I wanted to go to Songcun to drift, but I was irresponsible waiter (Ms. Fang Fei; Ye Junjian, I dare not tell me his name, not the old man!)the meaning of.At the same time as our theory, Ye Junjian was going to play very much, and he was going to hit people.This is the current situation of state -owned units!It is recommended that if you really have no other choice, don't come here, come here, regret one!I am a lesson in front of the car!In addition, the transportation here is extremely inconvenient. You need to go to the front desk to book a taxi, at least 15 yuan, which is much more expensive than each person in the city!Hotel feedback on August 7, 2008: We are sorry to you again for your encounter in this hotel.At that time, our staff apologized to you very much because Songcun Drifting gave you wrong information and apologized to you, and also gives you reasonable compensation for your valuable time, and you also received our staff.In addition, the rafting arranged for you is not what you say without any guilt and correction, let alone the meaning of beating people what you mean.But anyway, because the mistakes of our staff made you feel unhappy at our restaurant, we reported sincere apology again.We will strengthen management and training in the service quality and service quality of employees to better serve customers.In addition, because the hotel is an independent resort hotel, it is not in the downtown area (the distance from the urban area is about three minutes by drive) on the half mountainside of the thousands of Island Lakes, so the taxi needs to be calculated according to the charter (From the urban area to 10 yuan/vehicle on holidays, from holidays to the urban area, it is 15 yuan/vehicle because of reservations. The 2 yuan/person in the urban area refers to the price of a fixed line, which can carry different guests at the same time)."
1,第二次入住这个酒店了，服务很好，让客人感到很舒服，很满意。,"I stayed at this hotel for the second time, and the service was very good, so that the guests felt very comfortable and satisfied."
1,"酒店整体感觉还行,但是地毯不干净,需要清洗.","The overall feeling of the hotel is still good, but the carpet is not clean and need to be cleaned."
1,"不亏是园林酒店.酒店面积超大,住宿区分很多楼,并有面积不小的绿化.非常适合休闲度假,唯一欠缺一点的就是不直接面对海.","It is not a garden hotel. The hotel has a large area. There are many buildings in accommodation, and there are many greening. It is very suitable for leisure vacation. The only lack of lack is not to face the sea directly."
1,这次来的比较晚，出去吃饭不太方便，就在酒店的餐厅吃的海鲜自助，还可以，不过感觉价格稍微偏高了一点。我住的那个房间的隔音不是太好。,"This time I came relatively late. It was not convenient to go out for dinner. The seafood buffet eaten in the hotel's restaurant was okay, but it felt that the price was slightly higher.The sound insulation in the room I live is not very good."
1,这次入住真是出乎意料的好。在以往的旅行经历中从来没有这么开心过。1。山庄非常美，房间宽大，设施齐全，而且很新。2。那个胖胖的女服务员非常热心，有求必应。3。寒冷的冬天给准备了电热毯，非常贴心。4。烧烤非常好，很热心的帮助你，还送我们木瓜。^_^,"It was unexpectedly good this time.I have never been so happy in the past travel experience.1.The villa is very beautiful, the room is large, the facilities are complete, and it is very new.2.The fat female waiter is very enthusiastic and must respond.3.In the cold winter, prepared an electric blanket, which was very intimate.4.The barbecue is very good, helps you enthusiastically, and give us papaya.^_^"
1,我在这里看到很多不好的评论，比如前台小等。但是我抱着试一试的态度住了进去，发现房间的质量非常好，交通很方便，环境安静而且安全。我准备将此做为我出差福州的常住酒店。这类商务式或公寓式的酒店，就是提供一个方便舒适的住宿，没有其他更多的附加服务，所以实在不必有大前台等。各类酒店适合各类的客人，选择不同的酒店对不同的酒店应该有不同的标准。我想，那些失望的评论人，是误解了这类酒店的特点。,"I see a lot of bad comments here, such as small at the front desk.But I lived in with a trial attitude and found that the quality of the room was very good, the transportation was convenient, and the environment was quiet and safe.I am going to take this as a permanent hotel in Fuzhou.This kind of business or apartment hotels provides a convenient and comfortable accommodation. There are no other additional services, so there is no need to have a large front desk.Various types of hotels are suitable for various guests. Choosing different hotels should have different standards for different hotels.I think those disappointed commentators have misunderstood the characteristics of such hotels."
1,在南山区办事的话住这里还算方便，门口往哪个方向的车都有，就是稍微有点吵啊,It is convenient to stay here if you work in Nanshan District.
0,非常差的酒店，住的是高级房，每天都有n多的小强在桌子上、地上走过，向大堂副理反映，被告知是因为天热，所以会有。汗!前台服务也差，所住楼层上一层装修，到晚9点仍然干活，先打电话到客服，客服说不管，打到前台，前台说她也管不了。宽带上网，发生IP冲突，不停的断网，电话打到前台，她仍然说管不了，说就这样。总之，差到极点的一家三星级酒店。怎么没人考核他们!!!,"A very poor hotel, living in a high -end house, and N, who have more than N, walked on the table and on the ground every day, and reported to the deputy manager of the lobby that the argument was that because of the hot weather, there would be.Khan! The front desk service is also poor. On the floor of the living floor, the decoration is still working at 9 pm. Call the customer service first. The customer service says that it does not matter, and she can't control it at the front desk.Broadband online, IP conflicts occurred, constantly disconnected from the Internet, and the phone hit the front desk. She still couldn't control it.In short, a three -star hotel with a difference.Why no one evaluates them !!!"
0,刚从九华山回来，从携程订了百岁山庄，总体感觉还可以，就是满大堂飘溢着奇香，不知是什么，有些刺鼻。房间也算可以，很紧凑，设施、洗澡水也不错，可有股潮湿不通风的怪味，被单上也有不洁的痕迹。好在我们只注一天，也就将就了。,"I just returned from Jiuhua Mountain and ordered the 100 -year -old villa from Ctrip. The overall feeling is OK, that is, the lobby is full of strange incense. I do n’t know what it is.The room is also okay. It is very compact, and the facilities and bath water are also good. They have a strange smell of humid and ventilated, and there are unclean marks on the single.Fortunately, we only note for one day, and we will just."
0,地理位置还不错，到哪里都比较方便，但是服务不象是豪生集团管理的，比较差。下午睡了一觉并洗了一个澡，本来想让酒店再来打扫一下，所以，打开了，请打扫的服务灯，可是到晚上回酒店，发现打扫得服务灯被关掉了，而房间还是没有打扫过。,"The geographical location is not bad, it is more convenient everywhere, but the service is not as managed by Haosheng Group, which is relatively poor.I slept in the afternoon and took a bath. I wanted the hotel to clean it again.Clean."
1,酒店外观不怎么样，但是里面的服务很好，而且房间超级大，床也超级大，绝对可以睡4个人，早餐也可以。总体来说不错，性价比还ok。从虹桥机场过去打车19块，十来分钟就到了。要是在虹桥附近办事，推荐这家酒店，很方便。,"The hotel's appearance is not good, but the service inside is very good, and the room is super large, the bed is super large, you can definitely sleep 4 people, and breakfast is also possible.Overall is good, and the price is OK.19 yuan for a taxi from Hongqiao Airport for ten minutes.It is very convenient to recommend this hotel if you work near Hongqiao."
1,我住的是商务套房，650的价格性价比不高，感觉房间的配置上不了那个档次，厅里的沙发还是藤椅。。。大概想彰显一些热带风格？感觉不好。。。酒店大堂和内部的环境还可以吧，人员的服务也OK，如果房价能降个50-100元，比较合适。。。。。。还有。。门口的路正在修，一路走来还以为地震。。。汗。。。。心理阴影PS，有点好奇。。。白云山庄四个字竟然是出自毛主席之手？！！！想知道典故。。。宾馆反馈2008年6月18日：首先感谢您对酒店提供的宝贵意见。根据您的喜好我们已经给你专门设立了个性化档案，下次您来入住时我们不会再安排有藤椅沙发的商务套房，门口的市政施工只是暂时的，因为我们新昌正在评文明城市，而我们这边是示范性一条街，由此给您带来的不便在此表示谦意，并真诚的期待您的再次光临！山庄大门口的白云山庄四个字是从众多毛体中摘录下来的，而并非毛主席本人所题。,"I live in a business suite. The price of 650 is not cost -effective. I feel that the configuration of the room cannot be on that grade. The sofa in the hall is still a rattan chair.EssenceEssenceThink about some tropical styles?not feeling good.EssenceEssenceThe hotel lobby and internal environment are OK, and the service of personnel is OK.

1,是看了点评选择了这家酒店的，果然没有令人失望。每一位酒店的员工都是真心诚意地为客人服务的，在国内可谓首屈一指。比如我们要找酒店的超市，他们不是用手一指告诉你在哪里，而是亲自为你带路，在酒店的餐厅用餐，空调有点冷，我拿出披巾，想不到马上有服务生送上了一碗姜汤，吹海风有点感冒，去餐厅吃早餐时他们竟然发现，并送上了感冒冲剂和姜汤。令我们感动不已。酒店房间的设计和设施都很赞，每天还精心准备了小礼品，是罕有大方的酒店。唯一觉得要改进的是酒店员工对青岛市内具有特色的景点和饭店的了解的培训(当然这也是其他任何一家酒店都很难能做到的)，因为实在没有什么其它可建议的了：)补充点评2008年8月1日：建议大家不要去青岛海底世界，离海景花园很近的极地世界就很好玩了，去过极地再去海底会很失望大：),"I chose this hotel after watching the review, and it was not disappointing.Each hotel employee is sincerely serving guests, and it is second to none in China.For example, if we are looking for the hotel's supermarket, they do not tell you where they are in their hands, but to bring the way for you in person. When dining in the hotel's restaurant, the air conditioner is a bit cold. I took out a towel.A bowl of ginger soup, blowing the sea breeze a little cold. When they went to the restaurant for breakfast, they found out that they had a cold granula and ginger soup.Moving us.The design and facilities of the hotel room are very good, and they have carefully prepared small gifts every day. They are rare and generous hotels.The only thing that I think is to improve the training of unique attractions and restaurants in Qingdao employees (of course, this is also difficult for any other hotels), because there are no other suggestions :)Supplementary comment on August 1, 2008: It is recommended that you do not go to Qingdao Underwater World. The polar world is very close to the sea view garden."
1,"酒店很好,现代,简洁,干净,很舒适.房间很舒服,如果是情侣去,一定会加深感情的.大床房的卫生间是透明玻璃的,所以只适合亲密人同住.液晶电视","The hotel is very good, modern, simple, clean, very comfortable. The room is very comfortable. If it is a couple, it will deepen the relationship. The bathroom of the large bed room is transparent glass, so it is only suitable for close people to live together. LCD TV"
0,周边环境较差，服务的速度慢，态度还可以，价格太高。,"The surrounding environment is poor, the service is slow, the attitude is okay, and the price is too high."
1,酒店服务态度好，入住时有大型会议在此召开，房间无骚扰电话，靠近江边，步行十分钟即可吃到当地有名的三江鱼、坨坨鱼、西坝豆腐等特色菜。下次还住这里。打车十分方便，附近司机无人不知此酒店。,"The hotel has a good service attitude. There are large -scale meetings here during check -in. There is no harassment call in the room. It is near the river. You can eat special dishes such as the famous local Sanjiang fish, cricket fish, and Xiba tofu for ten minutes.I still live here next time.Taxi is very convenient. No one nearby does not know this hotel."
1,入住的是新装修的房间，设施环境较好。由于淄博人民太热情了，喝多了，把电子房卡掉了，赔了一百元，似乎贵了点，房价才二百多啊。,"The newly renovated room is checked, and the facility environment is better.Because the people of Zibo were too enthusiastic and drank too much, they lost the electronic room card and lost a hundred yuan. It seemed that it was more expensive. The house price was only more than 200."
0,此酒店设施陈旧，谈不上是星级酒店，只能算是招待所级别。房间小，走路地板摇动，总之，在我此住印象一般。下次不会再考虑！,"This hotel facilities are old. It is not a star hotel, but it can only be regarded as a hospitality level.The room was small and the floor was shaking. In short, I was impressed by me.I won't consider it next time!"
1,"坐TAXI时问司机这家酒店怎么样"",老酒店,人气旺,服务好,众口皆碑.""到酒店时感觉很温馨,我第一次来这家酒店,服务员都很热情,像认识我一样,出差这么久了,才有家的感觉!门童冒大雨去给我找车,回家时裤子都湿了,很让我感动.房间看得出,新装修过的,家私/床上用品也都是新的,可对出差已久的人来说,家的感觉是更重要的./","When taking TAXI, ask the driver how this hotel is "", the old hotel, the popularity, good service, and everyone's monument."" I felt very warm when I came to the hotel. I came to this hotel for the first time.I have been like a business trip for so long to have a feeling of home! Gate children went to find a car for me. When I went home, the pants were wet, which moved me very much.The bedding is also new, but for those who have been working hard for a long time, the family feels more important ./"
1,酒店风景蛮好的，服务也不错，去泸州的话是不错的选择,"The hotel's scenery is quite good and the service is good. If you go to Luzhou, it is a good choice"
1,整体感觉不错，房间不大，色调温和，床松软舒适，刚去过，室内温度挺高，洗澡水放几秒就有热水出来，比有些酒店强多了，早餐差点，不够40大元标准，尤其是做煎蛋的人老不再，住了三天没吃上煎蛋。结帐较慢，上午10点多结帐前台只有一个人，管理需要加强。,"The overall feels good, the room is not large, the color is gentle, the bed is soft and comfortable. I just visited. The indoor temperature is very high. The bath water is more hot water. It is much stronger than some hotels., Especially those who do fried eggs are no longer always, and have not eaten fried eggs for three days.The checkout is slow. There is only one person at the front desk at the checkout at more than 10 am. Management needs to be strengthened."
1,房间很舒服，服务也很好，价格高了。另外，通过CTRIP订的时候总是很难订到大床的房间，可是自己打电话去前台就可以订到。看来CTRIP和酒店的协议没有做好呀。,"The room is very comfortable, the service is also good, and the price is high.In addition, it is always difficult to book a big bed room when you order it through CTRIP, but you can make it to the front desk.It seems that the Ctrip and hotel agreements are not done well."
1,虽然装修不够细腻、淋浴水温不稳，但作为公寓型酒店应该来说还是不错的。,"Although the decoration is not delicate enough and the shower water temperature is unstable, it should be good as an apartment hotel."
1,"整体服务还不错,但被单第二天没换新的,是美中不足,价钱还可以","The overall service is not bad, but the one who has not been changed to the next day is not enough in the United States and China. The price is okay."
1,交通方便，服务到位。晚上11点多的时候，我们发现饮用水喝完了，给服务台打了个电话，马上就送来了。后来又打电话要东西，也是很快就送到了。态度非常好。只是有一点，为什么送水上来的是阿姨，而送拖鞋来的却是大叔呢？不公平呢！,"Convenient transportation and in place.At 11 o'clock in the evening, we found that the drinking water was finished, and a phone call gave the service desk immediately.Later, I called and asked for something, and it was quickly delivered.The attitude is very good.Just one thing, why is the aunt who came up with the water, but the uncle who sent the slippers?Not fair!"
0,这是我见过最垃圾的如家，前台服务还过得去，但是房间完全让人无法接受，从电梯出来开始楼层的走道甚至房间都有一股很难闻的味道，就好像地沟油的味道，打开窗户1个小时味道都没有消失，让人昏昏沉沉头疼难受。后来我们要求前台给我们换房间，换楼层，换了以后味道有相对的减轻但是还是有一点味道，挥之不去。一个晚上我们都是开着窗户和空调睡觉的，第二天天一亮我们就退了房间。现在想想都觉得可怕~！在那里呆久了会让人很难受像晕车一样想吐！,"This is the most rubbish I have ever seen. The front desk service is still available, but the room is completely unacceptable. From the elevator, the aisle of the floor and even the room of the room have a difficult taste.The taste did not disappear for an hour, which made people feel dull and uncomfortable.Later, we asked the front desk to change the room and change the floor. After changing it, the taste was relatively relieved, but it still had a little taste.One night we all opened the windows and air -conditioning to sleep, and we returned the room the next day.It's terrible to think about it now ~!Staying there for a long time will make people feel uncomfortable like motion sickness!"
1,通过携程电话订的，未到前有点担心，入住后总算放心，总体还是不错，特别是在张家界市外部环境脏、乱、差的情况，来到这个小酒店，感觉还是可以。我是国庆期间住的，价格有点夸张，不过只有忍了。,"Through Ctrip's call, I was a little worried before I arrived. After checking in, I was always assured. The overall is still good, especially in the situation where the environment is dirty, chaotic, and poor in Zhangjiajie City. When I came to this small hotel, I felt that it was okay.I lived during the National Day, and the price was a bit exaggerated, but I only endured it."
1,我是第一次来这家酒店入住，由于是晚上的航班，也因天气的温差问题，有些感冒，拉肚子，我本来心脏也有些不好，正担心着，这事让客房部经理发现了，前来慰问并赠送了水果。凌晨12点半，值班经理还通知了西餐厅经理为我准备了稀饭和小菜，并询问了身体状况。当时我对酒店员工的关心真的十分感动，没想到出差在外仿佛还有“家人一般的照顾”。由于是来出差，顺便自己当作旅游一下，这酒店又位于市中心，交通很便利，我自己买了份地图，服务员帮我把要出游的景点一个个都标志出来，还相应介绍了些有名的景点，给我节省了时间，也增添了我自出游玩的美好心情。过来出差来得匆忙，忘记带充电器，客房部经理得知后，还帮我找来了我手机相应的充电器。总之这次的出差，我倍受感动，也玩得很愉快。如果下次再来厦门，我一定毫不犹豫的选择宏都大饭店。,"I came to this hotel for the first time. Because it was a night flight, and because of the temperature difference between the weather, I had some colds and diarrhea. I was also a little bad. I was worried. This incident made the manager of the guest room discovery.Come to condolences and given away fruits.At 12:30 in the morning, the manager on duty also informed the Western restaurant manager to prepare porridge and side dishes for me and asked about physical condition.At that time, I was really moved by the hotel employees. I didn't expect that there was a business business as if there was ""family care"" outside.Because it is a business trip, by the way, I think it is a tour. The hotel is located in the city center. The transportation is very convenient. I bought a map myself.The attractions have saved me time and added the beautiful mood of my self -play.Come to a business trip in a hurry and forgot to bring a charger. After learning about it, the manager of the guest room also helped me find the corresponding charger in my mobile phone.In short, I was moved and I played well.If you come to Xiamen next time, I will not hesitate to choose the Hongdu Hotel."
1,"这个酒店的房间有点旧啦,估计开了有好几年了,房门要两个人里外合力才能打开.周围环境不怎么样,建议以后还是住海边那片的房比较好.服务态度还行,餐点就实在不怎么样了.以后不为了省钱还是别住那儿了",The room of this hotel is a bit old. It is estimated that it has been opened for several years. The door of the door requires two people to work in and outside. The surrounding environment is not good. It is recommended to live in the room by the seaside.The meal is really not very good.

0,北京机场到酒店打表205元.挂牌4星的酒店，携程说是3星--非常正确！老实说是2星还差不多。1）不是所有房间都有宽带，即使有也请先试一下，我为此在晚上换了3间房间。2）标房内没有免费的瓶装水供应。3）要打电话的请注意了：：：不管对方接听与否，20秒后开始收费！！非常奇特的规定！所以，千万要小心了。4）800免费携程电话在这家酒店是要收费的，小心！5）10800AT&T对方付费电话是要收费的，不是服务费，是按本地电话收费的，反复解释还是没有用的！！！不只是他家的电话是不是中国电信的，中国电信10000#都说是免费的啦，还是解释不通！6）房间及其陈旧，拖鞋比纸还薄，空调不热，还没有暖气设施，害得我半夜起来加被子--难以想象，这是家在伟大首都北京的挂牌4星酒店。,"Beijing Airport to the hotel for a list of 205 yuan. The 4-star hotel is listed, Ctrip said it is 3 stars-very correct!To be honest, 2 stars are almost the same.1) Not all rooms have broadband. Even if you have any, please try it first. I changed 3 rooms in the evening.2) There is no free bottle water supply in the standard room.3) Please pay attention if you want to call:: Regardless of whether the other party answers or not, start charging after 20 seconds!IntersectionVery strange regulations!So be careful.4) 800 free Ctrip phone is charged in this hotel, be careful!5) 10800AT & T paid a fee for the other party, not a service fee, but a local telephone charging. Repeated explanation is useless!IntersectionIntersectionNot just whether his phone call is from China Telecom, China Telecom 10000#all said that it is free, or it is not explained!6) The room and its old, slippers are thinner than paper, the air conditioner is not hot, and there is no heating facilities, which makes me get up in the middle of the night to add a quilt-it is difficult to imagine. This is a 4-star hotel listed in Beijing in the great capital."
1,周围环境绝佳，处于市区美丽的员当湖湖心岛（白鹭洲）上，闹中取静，动静相宜，附近有几家厦门有名的海鲜酒楼而且还有酒吧夜总会，都是比较不错的。,"The surrounding environment is excellent, and the beautiful members of the urban area are on the lake and lake heart island (Eguzhou).Essence"
1,酒店设施看得出来质量不是很好，细节都很粗糙。服务还可以,"The hotel facilities can see that the quality is not very good, and the details are rough.Serving"
1,酒店环境不错，可房间一般。预订时一直强调要视野好一些的，结果因先前入住的客人过了入住时间还没退房，给了个比较差的房。房间的味道也极难闻。可能是5.1客人较多吧，打电话到前台要求看能不能换一间，结果也一直没有回音。,"The hotel environment is good, but the room is average.When booking, I have always emphasized that the vision must be better. As a result, because the guests who had been checked in before had a check -in time, they had not left the house, and gave a worse room.The taste of the room is also very unpleasant.It may be 5.1 more guests. Calling the front desk to ask if you can change it, but there is no echo."
1,四月清明假期去的，早餐一般，停车场不够，晚上晚一点回去就要停到对面没人管的空地。,"I went to the Qingming holiday in April. Breakfast was average. The parking lot was not enough. When I went back in the evening, I had to stop to the open space of no one."
0,"这个酒店给我的印象如此之差.先说房间,一般,没有什么好,也没有什么不好,酒店开了很大的餐厅,比较吵闹,其他附属的什么购物中心,美容美发全部取消了.服务:前台的一个小姐非常专业,我刚报出姓,她即能以全名称呼,而且也长的很漂亮,是该酒店唯一的亮点.用餐非常不好,早餐非常差,没有什么东西吃,都是菜饭什么的,打些做中午的快餐还能将就,适合做早餐的除了很少的几块糕点和粥就没有什么了,怀疑菜都是酒店开的餐厅的存货.早餐的牛奶是奶粉冲的,有很浓的香精味道,难以下咽.晚上到餐厅用餐是最痛苦的回忆:少数人很难点菜吃,因为都是适合人多的菜,象我一个人几乎没法点.套餐,简餐都没有.炒个青菜要18块.重点给你们讲讲这个炒青菜,我一个人,所以点了香菇菜心,上来一看,没有一片香菇,我问为什么,答曰,这个菜的名字就叫香菇菜,它的菜心就叫香菇菜心(上的也不算是菜心,是整棵的小青菜)还有点了个小份的辣子鸡丁,上来一看,很大一盆,我说错了吧,我不要大份的,答没错,我吃了发现的确没错,而且还是超小份,因为里面没有几块鸡,还大多数都是骨头,很少的肉连在骨头上,再一看,大盆还是满的,全是辣椒和一些花生米粒.这个酒店我是再也不会去住了.是我住过最过分的酒店再说周围环境,柳市的民风也很不好,出租车全是宰客的,起步5元,都收10元,还随意加价,记价器都不能用,即使给你用你也看不清,因为他们都不换色带,打印出的颜色几乎没有,要报销的可就惨了.换车也没有用,都一样,刁民我建议到乐清的都住在乐清市里,据说只有市里的出租车比较规范,附近镇上全部都是宰人的出租车,出门从乐清市里叫车比较好","The impression of this hotel is so bad. First of all, the room, general, there is nothing good, there is nothing bad. The hotel has a large restaurant, which is more noisy. What shopping centers in other attached and cosmetic hairdressers have been canceled.Service: A lady at the front desk is very professional. I just reported my surname. She was able to name it in full name, and she was very beautiful. It was the only highlight of the hotel. The meal was very bad. The breakfast was very bad. There was nothing to eat., Are all vegetable rice or something. You can still do some fast food for noon. It is suitable for breakfast. Except for a few pieces of pastry and porridge, there is nothing to do. I suspect that the dishes are all restaurants in the hotel. BreakfastMilk is rushed with milk powder. It has a very strong flavor and it is difficult to swallow. It is the most painful memory to eat at the restaurant at night: it is difficult for a few people to order food, because it is suitable for people with many people, just like I can hardly be alone.Order. Package, there are no meals. Stir -fried vegetables need 18 pieces. The key point will tell you this fried vegetables, I am alone, so I ordered the heart of mushrooms and came up.The name of this dish is called mushrooms. Its heart is called mushrooms and vegetables (it is not the heart, it is the whole green vegetable) and a little bit of spicy chicken.It's a big pot. I said it was wrong. I don't want a large portion. I answered right. I was really right when I ate it, and it was still super small, because there were not a few chickens in it, and most of them were bones. VeryThe less meat is connected to the bones. Looking at it again, the big pot is still full, all of which are peppers and some peanut rice grains. I will never live in this hotel.The folk customs of Liushi are also very bad. Taxi are all slaughtered. They start 5 yuan and receive 10 yuan. They also increase the price at will. The price device cannot be used.If you do n’t change the ribbon, there are almost no colors printed. It ’s miserable to be reimbursed. It’ s the same for changing cars. It ’s the same. Diaomin I suggest that all those who live in Yueqing are living in Leqing. It is said that there is only a taxi in the city.It is relatively standardized that all the taxis are slaughtered in the nearby town. It is better to call a car from Leqing City to go out."
1,环境感觉不错，因为都是别墅式的房子，就是游泳池，健身房都是私人承包的，所以不免费的，不能接受！~就是冲着游泳池去的，结果还不免费！~还要500多一天，不太值！~而且床很短，大概1米8的床吧，本人1米73，躺床上脚还会露在床外。。。此时，我就开始怀念索菲特的大床了，又大又舒服！~也可能是因为我喜欢只枕一点点枕头，我老公和我身高差不多，他却说正好，反正高个子喜欢平躺的朋友得好好想清楚了，呵呵不过因为住的人不多，还挺幽静的，还挺干净的，装修还挺舒服，服务员很客气早餐从没有去吃过，因为不是上班早来不及，就是周末爱睡懒觉，呵呵总得来说就是：绣花枕头，游泳池收费，宽带收费，不值这个价，要不是老公图个游泳方便，才不会住呢！~补充点评2008年2月22日：装修是装修风格比较舒服，现在那交通方便多了，从大门走到8号线3-5分钟,"The environment feels good, because it is a villa -style house, that is, the swimming pool, the gym is privately contracted, so it is not free and unacceptable!~ It just went to the swimming pool, and the results were not free!~ More than 500 a day, not too worth it!~ And the bed is very short, about 1.8 meters of bed, I am 1.73 meters, and I will be exposed outside the bed.EssenceEssenceAt this point, I started missing Sopht's big bed, big and comfortable!~ It may also be because I like only a little pillow, my husband is about the same height, but he said that it is right. Anyway, friends who like to lie down can be clearly thought about, but because there are not many people living, it is quite quiet, it's quite quiet.Well, it is quite clean, the decoration is quite comfortable, the waiter is very polite to breakfast, because it is either too late to go to work, or to sleep on the weekend, always: embroidered pillows, swimming pool charges, broadband charges, not worth it, not worth itIf this price is not convenient for her husband to swim!~ Supplementary comment February 22, 2008: The decoration is more comfortable in decoration style, and now the traffic is much more convenient. From the gate to 3-5 minutes from Line 8"
1,房间很宽敞，很干净。处在闹市区，很方便，能看到整个城市也能看到一片海。我个人比较满意。,The room is spacious and clean.It is very convenient to be in the downtown area. You can see a sea in the whole city.I am personal.
1,"3月下旬入住第二天单人间(300元)优点:房间景观开扬,可立即入住(不知是否优点),前台及行李服务生不错,入住及退房快,睡觉可选不同枕头,房间环境宁静(住高层).改善:300元的房间可接受.总评:地点距新南门较远,四周只有电话商店,走十多分钟才有其他类型店铺,另如送早餐会较好,总体比第一天进步.","In late March, stay in a single room (300 yuan) for the second day of the day: the room landscape is open, and you can immediately stay in (I don't know if the advantages).Tranquility (Housing High -rise). Improvement: The room of 300 yuan is acceptable. Total review: The location is far from the Xinnan Gate. There are only telephone shops around the surrounding area, and there are other types of shops for more than ten minutes.Progress on the first day."
1,很不错的酒店！！房间设施很舒适，浴缸很大！还送儿童玩具，各个细节也都非常好！,"Very good hotel!IntersectionThe room facilities are very comfortable and the bathtub is large!Also send children's toys, all details are also very good!"
1,节日期间房价800多，贵了不少，宾馆地方很偏僻，要不是自己开车，我是不敢天黑以后到这里来住的，不过酒店服务相当不错，自助餐较丰盛，午餐98元／位。,"During the festival, house prices were more than 800, and it was a lot more expensive. The hotel in the hotel was remote. If I hadn't drove myself, I would not dare to live here after dark, but the hotel service is quite good, the buffet is more rich, and the lunch is 98 yuan / person."
1,非常非常不错，强力向各位推荐，环境好，房间好，空气好，服务好，关键是房价是162元/天还送两份早餐，性价比绝对一流。再次强力推荐！！！,"Very, very good, I recommend it to you, the environment is good, the room is good, the air is good, and the service is good. The key is that the house price is 162 yuan/day and two breakfast is given. The cost performance is absolutely first -class.Recommend again!IntersectionIntersection"
1,每次来厦门都住的地方。上次住是半年前，感觉最有特色的餐饮变差了很多，这次还是再住一次，发现又变好了。吃了一次68的自助晚餐，感觉很好，人也少，菜品很多，而且都是不错的菜。唯一的缺点是自酿的啤酒没有以前好了。下次还去住。,"Every time you come to Xiamen, you live.Last time I lived half a year ago, and I felt that the most distinctive catering became much worse. This time I still lived again, and found that it became better.After eating a 68 buffet dinner, it feels good, there are few people, there are many dishes, and they are all good dishes.The only disadvantage is that the brewed beer is not as good as before.Go to live next time."
0,天宇也就占了个位置还可以到光，内部设施和消耗品配备，实在是不怎么样，而且，很贵,Tianyu can also take a position and can reach the light.
1,环境不错，服务态度很好，地理位置也很好，交通也方便。198的价位性价比是相当的高了，房间装修很时尚，还有液晶电视，每天都有水果和报纸送，由于本人睡了懒觉就没法对早餐进行评价了，总次入住相当满意，如果下次到银川，入住宁丰肯定是首选，比隔壁180的如家划算多了。唯一美中不足的就是半夜隔音稍微差了点，醒来的时候听见隔壁房间的电视声了，不过这是酒店的通病了，小问题了，如果能改进就更好了。,"Good environment, good service attitude, good geographical location, and convenient transportation.The price / performance ratio of 198 is quite high, the room decoration is very fashionable, and there are LCD TVs. There are fruits and newspapers every day. Because I am lazy, I can’t evaluate breakfast.The next time I arrived at Yinchuan, staying in Ningfeng is definitely the first choice, more than 180 next door.The only disadvantage is that the sound insulation in the middle of the night was a bit worse. When I woke up, I heard the TV sound of the room next door, but this is a common problem in the hotel. It is better if it can be improved."
1,很舒服的一个度假酒店。虽然黄金周的时候入住人多了点，但是服务和设施的都没有落后。我是先通过旅行社订了一天的房，结果就喜欢上了这个酒店，想延住，却被告知没有房间了（因为是黄金周期间），最后是通过携程预订了房间。看来携程还是不错的，这么紧张的时候还能订到酒店。,"Very comfortable resort.Although there are more people in the Golden Week, neither the service and facilities are backward.I first booked a day of room through a travel agency. As a result, I fell in love with the hotel and wanted to extend, but I was told that there was no room (because it was the Golden Week period), and finally I book the room through Ctrip.It seems that Ctrip is still good, so you can order the hotel when you are so nervous."
0,9月23日的值班经理（女的）很牛啊！我当天由于航班原因早晨3点57分到的酒店，我订的是8点岛（携程最早的到达时间）在服务员的允许下进入酒店房间，当时并未提出要加收费用，收了我500押金。中午值班经理（女的）却突然打电话到我房间，说我必须再交一天的费用，我据理力争，对她说你们的服务员应该有告知义务，如果你事先说好，我同意，你收多少多不算多！她竟然说和你讲不清楚，挂了我电话。后又让当天的服务员打电话到我房间，后在我的质问下他也承认了是他的错误，并愿承担我的损失。我当即和值班经理联系，但她竟然说，这是我处理的和他没关系，你一定要付。我当即提出退房（当时9点），她竟然说你现在退我也要收你一天半的房钱。并说这是酒店规定，我说你拿出来给我看，她竟然回答我这是保密的。我下楼退了房间，我要她的名字，并告知她，我要投诉你的，她竟然说我没有必要告诉你我的名字，我是经理！牛啊。这样的服务态度竟然还是管理人员，可想而知她管理的人员将以什么样的态度去为客户服务！补充点评2006年10月4日：这个酒店真得没办法用语言来形容了。还是希望各位管好自己的钱包，免得被收了钱还不知道怎么回事！各位最好的办法就是不要去住，否则你就不知道到底为了什么付的钱！请多多转告！,"The duty manager (female) on September 23 is very good!I arrived at the hotel at 3:57 in the morning on the same day. I booked at 8 o'clock islands (the earliest arrival time of Ctrip) at the allowance of the waiter.deposit.At noon, the manager (female) suddenly called my room, saying that I had to pay the cost of another day. I was struggling to tell her that your waiter should have the obligation.How much is not too much!She said she couldn't tell you clearly, and hung up my phone.Later, the waiter of the day called my room, and under my question, he also admitted that it was his mistake and was willing to bear my losses.I immediately contacted the manager on duty, but she even said that this was that I had nothing to do with him. You must pay.I immediately asked for check -in (at 9 o'clock), and she said that you have to collect your room for a day and a half now.He said that this was a hotel regulation. I said you took it out for me, and she answered that I was confidential.I went downstairs and retreated to the room. I wanted her name and told her that I would complain to you. She said that I didn't need to tell you my name. I am a manager!Bull.Such a service attitude is still a manager. I can imagine what kind of attitude she managed to serve customers!Supplementary comment on October 4, 2006: This hotel really can't describe it in words.I still hope that you can control your wallet so that you don't know what's going on after being collected!The best way you do n’t want to live, otherwise you do n’t know what money you pay!Please tell me a lot!"
1,入住的时候，恰逢前台的POS机坏了，只能预付现金，有些不便。不过位于一楼的餐厅真是物美价廉，值得一去。,"At the time of check -in, the POS machine at the front desk was broken and could only pay cash in advance, which was a bit inconvenient.However, the restaurant on the first floor is really low -cost and worthy."
1,还是老宾馆好，闹中取境，环境很好，服务也好，这次春节去住，不小心把皮夹掉在宾馆，退房离开后收到宾馆来电，最后完璧归照，感觉非常好！以后去一定还住那里,"It ’s better to get old hotels, get in trouble, the environment is very good, and the service is good. This time I live in the Spring Festival. I accidentally clamped the leather in the hotel.IntersectionGo there in the future, you must live there"
0,"设施还将就,但服务是相当的不到位,休息了一个晚上我白天出去,中午回来的时候居然房间都没有整理,尽管我挂了要求整理房间的牌子.","The facilities will be on the way, but the service is not in place. I went out for one night after rest. When I came back at noon, I did not organize the room."
1,优点：房间硬件不错，崭新，现代；虽然房子本身有年头了，但老房子层高很高，宽敞。缺点：价格其实小贵；房间略微拥挤；宽带收费10元且网线需主动索取；不含早餐；接机OK但是不送，虽然看到客人有不少行李。参考：酒店对于常住客人标间100元，标间直接入住价格320元，我们晚上入住时剩余一个套间打折350元。机场附近的住宿至少4家，如果你想要找更好的折扣，在机场出港等待提取行李的时候，就有好几个机场附近的酒店/招待所的联络柜台，最便宜的机场招待所只要几十元。,"Advantages: The hardware of the room is good, brand new, modern; although the house itself is old, the old house is very tall and spacious.Disadvantages: the price is actually small; the room is slightly crowded; the broadband charges are 10 yuan and the network cable needs to be requested actively; without breakfast; the pick -up is OK but not delivered, although there are a lot of luggage to see the guests.Reference: The hotel is 100 yuan for the permanent guest standard room, and the target room directly checks in the price of 320 yuan. When we stay in the evening, the remaining suite is discounted by 350 yuan.At least 4 accommodations near the airport. If you want to find a better discount, when the airport is out of the port waiting for the luggage, there are several hotels/reception counters near the airport.Essence"
1,这家酒店非常不错硬件方面比较好，尤其卫生间比较有特色，是干湿分离的，而且是用玻璃隔断的，视觉上比较有现代感。事实上这样的卫生间布局是比较占地方的，需用面积比一般的用大一点，所以给人的感觉不错，而且两人入住的话，在使用上不会互相影响。,"This hotel is very good in hardware, especially the bathroom is more distinctive, is separated from wet and wet, and is partitioned with glass. It has a visual modern sense.In fact, such a bathroom layout is relatively located. It needs to be a bit larger than the normal, so it feels good, and if the two stay in, they will not affect each other in use."
0,条件一般，就是地理位置不错，离市中心比较近，出行还比较方便。,"The conditions are average, that is, the geographical location is good, it is closer to the city center, and it is more convenient to travel."
0,优点：1，交通比较方便，离中山北路地铁站步行5分钟。2，早餐比较丰富缺点：1，预定的特价房，入住时给我安排到一个半露的楼（房间大部分露在外面），感觉不太安全。2、卫生，入住第三天时，房间门口看见一只死蟑螂，房间里飞着2只苍蝇。因此换了房间。3，服务不太细致，不知是不是因为我住的时间长，在后几天的时候，卫生间的用具没有给我及时更换新的。宾馆反馈2008年8月1日：尊敬的嘉宾：您好！首先感谢您选择莫泰168共和新路旅店，并真诚地感谢你对本店的客观评价。您的意见是我们改进、提高服务质量的动力。针对您的批评，本店已责成相关部门进行了整改，在此向您表示诚挚的歉意！为表示本店的诚意，欢迎您下次再次选择本旅店，一方面是帮助监督、检查我们的工作，另一方面本店将对你选择的房型进行升级！谢谢！期待您的再次入住！上海莫泰168共和新路旅店,"Advantages: 1. The transportation is more convenient and walks 5 minutes from the Zhongshan North Road Metro Station.2. Breakfast is rich in disadvantages: 1. The booked special room, arranged for me to a semi -exposed building (most of the rooms exposed outside) when I stayed in, it felt not too safe.2. Hygiene, on the third day of staying, a dead cockroach was seen at the door of the room, and two flies were flying in the room.So I changed the room.3. The service is not very detailed. I wonder if it ’s because I live for a long time. In the next few days, the toilet utensils did not replace the new one in time.Hotel feedback on August 1, 2008: Dear guest: Hello!First of all, thank you for choosing Motai 168 Republican New Road Hotel and sincerely thank you for your objective evaluation of our store.Your opinion is our motivation to improve and improve service quality.In response to your criticism, our store has instructed relevant departments to make rectification, and I will apologize to you here!In order to express the sincerity of our store, you are welcome to choose our hotel again next time.

1,环境非常不错，唯一的缺点就是电视不是液晶的卫生间要赞扬一下，超五星级的标准,The environment is very good. The only disadvantage is that TV is not a LCD toilet to praise.
1,酒店位于市中心。房间设施古朴典雅。很有情调。室内像上个世纪初老上海酒店的内部布局。温泉也不错!下次我还会去。我住的是2005房间。,The hotel is located in the city center.The room facilities are simple and elegant.Very emotional.The indoor internal layout of the old Shanghai hotel at the beginning of the last century.Hot spring is also good! I will go next time.I live in Room 2005.
0,"订了两次这家酒店,遇到都是几乎相同的问题,我在备注里写的很清楚,""不临街,安静,高层,不要KTV上的房型,""不知道什么原因,是携程没有把信息传给酒店,还是酒店的理解有问题,第一次给了我","After ordering this hotel twice, I encountered almost the same problem. I wrote very clearly in the remarks.The information is passed to the hotel, or there is a problem with the understanding of the hotel. I gave it to me for the first time"
1,房间很干净！早餐很丰盛！门童很好！已经是第二次订那了。以后还会住。,The room is clean!Breakfast is rich!Gate children are very good!It's the second time to book.I will live in the future.
1,酒店的条件很好，价格也很便宜（190元）,The hotel has good conditions and the price is very cheap (190 yuan)
1,酒店服务员态度很好，晚上还送两个小玩偶到房间．但是酒点的自助早餐实在不感恭维。因为餐厅是敞开式的，所以没有空调（喜来登也是这样，但也有封闭的带空调的餐厅，客人可以自己选择），虽然海风习习，还是会有些汗，如果吃现烧的米粉，会很热。但是最受不了的是苍蝇蚊子，苍蝇在食物上或飞或停，蚊子围着我们打转。所以每次早餐，我们点现煮的，并且以超快的速度吃完。,"The hotel waiter was very good, and two dolls were sent to the room at night.But the self -service breakfast of the wine is really complmented.Because the restaurant is open, there is no air conditioner (the same is true of Sheraton, but there are also closed restaurants with air -conditioning, guests can choose it by themselves). Although the sea breeze is learned, it will still be sweaty. If you eat the rice noodles, it will be hot.But the most unbearable is flies mosquitoes, flies flying or stopped on food, and mosquitoes around us.So each breakfast, we cooked it, and finished at a super fast speed."
1,五一期间来的这里，感觉如果再来济南，可以继续住这里。前台服务态度很好，因为我携老小自驾到济南，入住时间需要拖后，他们保留房间了，离店时，推迟了我退房的时间。出门在外，尤其是假期，能得到这种有商量的服务还是感觉不错的。周围有家乐福，还算是方便。酒店早餐还算丰富，午餐晚餐上的菜量很大，第一次见到那么大的盘子盆子装菜；但是价格小贵。出门在外也好，居家过日子也好，整洁舒适即可。,"I came here during May Day, and I feel that if you come to Jinan again, you can continue to live here.The front desk service attitude is very good, because I took my old and young self -driving to Jinan. After the time of staying, they needed to retain the room. When I left the store, I postponed my check -out time.Going out, especially during the holidays, it still feels good to get such discussive services.There is a Carrefour around, which is convenient.The hotel breakfast is quite abundant. The amount of dishes at lunch and dinner is very large. For the first time, I saw such a large plate for dishes; but the price is small.Either go out or live at home, neat and comfortable."
0,国庆期间订了副楼套房，差得不止一点点，家俱破旧，电视机小得不得了，想象不出的简陋,"During the National Day, I booked a sub -building suite, which was more than a little bit, the furniture was dilapidated, the TV was too small, and I couldn't imagine the humbleness."
0,反正这个酒店从各方面来讲都差强人意早餐我没吃过，所以不作评价我住了一周，没有换过床单和被子被子上有黑颜色脏东西地毯很脏酒店弥漫着一股油烟味道打扫方面时服务员甚至不会好好地帮你把被子拉平放好位置还是皱巴巴的我之所以从298元的房间换到228元的房间，是因为我本来就一个人住，而且这两个房间除了单双床外没有任何区别酒店的空调都是不好用的，开不了，298的房间一样如此我也没问酒店关于空调的问题了因为太原本来就没有什么好的中级酒店这个城市我很失望，没什么任何发展可言了,"Anyway, this hotel has not been eaten in all aspects, so I haven't eaten it, so I did n’t evaluate it for a week. I did n’t change the sheets and quilts on the quilt.The waiter will not even help you help you to flatten the quilt or wrinkled or wrinkled from a room of 298 yuan to 228 yuan.There is no difference in the air conditioner of the hotel outside the bed. It is not easy to drive. The 298 room is like this. I didn't ask the hotel about the air conditioner about the air conditioner. Because there is no good intermediate hotel in the city, I am very disappointed. NothingAny development can be at all"
0,这个酒店根本不是5星，骗人，他们的服务和设备都是最差的，尤其是服务态度极端恶劣，请大家不要住这个酒店。,"This hotel is not 5 stars at all, deceived, their services and equipment are the worst, especially the service attitude is extremely bad. Please do not live in this hotel."
1,"在广安唯一的一家五星级的酒店,环境还不错,服务员急需培训,基本没有服务意识.早餐中应该多加点中餐的成分,住的时间少不便再做深层次的评价.","In Guang'an's only five -star hotel, the environment is not bad. The waiter urgently needs training and basically has no sense of service. The ingredients of Chinese food should be added to the breakfast, and the time to live is less inconvenient to make a deep -level evaluation."
0,10月3号入住该酒店，整体感觉还算可以，下次再到成都肯定不会再住这家了。优点：1、房间大，有冰箱、微波炉等，设备比较全，还可以做饭和家一样。2、酒店周围有很多吃的，吃饭很方便。3、交通也很方便4、小区里也相对比较安静缺点：1、服务很差，服务员特少，服务响应特慢2、房间的卫生很差，临入睡前我们才发现枕巾、床单、被套都没有换过，脏死了。卫生间里的毛巾也不太干净，也很旧了。3、早餐品种很少,"Check in the hotel on October 3, and the overall feeling is okay. Next time, I will definitely not stay in Chengdu.Advantages: 1. The room is large, there are refrigerators, microwave ovens, etc. The equipment is relatively complete, and you can cook the same as home.2. There are a lot of food around the hotel, and eating is very convenient.3. Transportation is also very convenient. 4. The community is relatively quiet disadvantages: 1. Poor service, fewer waiters, and slow service response 2. The room is poor. We only find that pillow towels, sheets, quilts, and quilts are all before going to bed.I have not changed, dirty.The towels in the bathroom are not very clean and old.3. There are very few breakfast varieties"
0,房间的条件实在是很一般，很陈旧的感觉。我们的房间也是正好对这个停车场。早餐也不怎么样，种类很少。也就是3星级的标准，房价却很贵。去圣亚海洋世界的时候无意中看到了星海假日酒店，外面看上去感觉就特别好，蛮好多花点钱订这个的呢,"The conditions of the room are really average, very old.Our room is also on this parking lot.Breakfast is not good, there are very few types.That is, the 3 -star standard, but house prices are very expensive.When I went to the San Ya Ocean World, I accidentally saw the Xinghai Holiday Hotel. It looked particularly good outside."
1,很多年前住过一次。这次是第二次住。房间很大，也很干净。由于酒店门前的道理好了，因此也方便了很多。酒店李南滨路的美食一条街不远。酒店的早餐真是非常不错，和很多更高档次的酒店比也不逊色。但是这么多年感觉酒店的外观太旧了，大堂也没有了四星级酒店的气派。,"I have lived once many years ago.This time is the second time.The room is large and clean.Because the reason in front of the hotel is good, it is much more convenient.The food on the hotel Li Nanbin Road is not far away.The breakfast of the hotel is really good, and it is not inferior to many higher -grade hotels.But for so many years, I feel that the appearance of the hotel is too old, and the lobby does not have the aura of four -star hotels."
0,入住11楼大床房，一出电梯就有明显的地毯散发的霉味；房间的窗子不能打开，即便这样，也有蚊子存在。最恐怖的是有灵异事件。入住2晚，第一天平安无事；第二天，凌晨3点，被“滴”“滴”的声音吵醒，一看房间的台式机电脑自动启动了，之后读光盘，失败，就滴一声。过去按电源键，怎么也关不上电脑，只好拔电源。可是，我都是用自己的笔记本，这台式机从来没碰过。实在是不会再去住的酒店。,"In the large bed room on the 11th floor, as soon as the elevator came out, there was obvious mildew smelting of carpets; the windows in the room could not be opened, even so, there were mosquitoes.The most horrible thing is that there are spiritual events.Check in 2 nights, and there is nothing to do on the first day; the next day, at 3 am, it was awakened by the sound of ""drip"" and ""drip"". At first glance, the desktop computer in the room was automatically started. After reading the CD, it failed.One sound.Pressing the power button in the past, how could it not turn on the computer, so I had to pull out the power.However, I use my own notebook, and this machine has never touched it.There will be a hotel that will not stay again."
1,5.1期间入住的，我住的是小标间，去了才知道小标间是靠马路的几栋。由于修路车辆不是很多，所以噪音影响不是很大，总体来讲还可以。1.热水：房间有电热水器，所以热水很好，就是容量小，还没洗完水就凉了2.床单/被套：还挺干净3.服务：服务员挺朴实的，服务还可以4.空调：开的是暖风，开半天才有效果5.餐饮：价格合理，菜肴可口6.度假村环境：一般，比较荒凉7.海边环境：人少，但不是特别干净,"During the 5.1 period, I lived in a small standard room. I went to know that the small standard room was on the road.Because there are not many road repair vehicles, the noise effect is not very great, overall.1. Hot water: There is an electric water heater in the room, so the hot water is very good, that is, the capacity is small, the water is cold before washing the water 2. The sheets/quilts: quite clean 3. The service: the waiter is very simple, the service can also 4 can also be 4 can also be 4 can also be 4.. Air conditioning: The warm wind is opened, it is effective for half a day 5. Dining: Reasonable price, dishes can be oral 6. Resort environment: Generally, desolate 7. Seaside environment: few people, but not particularly clean people, not particularly clean"
0,"早餐不好,服务不到位,晚餐无西餐,早餐晚餐相同,房间条件不好,餐厅不分吸烟区.房间不分有无烟房.","The breakfast is not good, the service is not in place, there is no western meal for dinner, the breakfast and dinner are the same, the room conditions are not good, the restaurant does not distinguish the smoking area."
0,充其量一个度假村而已，客房其实并不大，不知通过什么手段评上4星了。酒店近邻104国道，是连套别墅销售附带的设施。房间装修味道很大，其中一个房子竟然没有窗户。卫生间一股臭味，设施还不如3星级酒店。如果不是去山东路上太晚，怎么也不会到这个酒店。,"At best a resort, the guest room is not large. I don't know how to comment on 4 stars.The hotel near the National Highway 104 is a facility attached to the sales of villas.The decoration of the room tastes a lot, and one of the houses has no windows.The bathroom has a smell, and the facilities are not as good as a 3 -star hotel.If it wasn't for too late to go to Shandong Road, I wouldn't go to this hotel."
1,环境很不错，。。淡季携程的价格也蛮有诱惑力的过程中遇到了一些问题，。。不过携程还是有一点影响力的，。。在反复督促下，还是比较圆满的解决了。。。表扬一下五星级确实不错，温泉值得一泡。置身于森林中，。。面向翠湖，。。细雨纷纷，。。和热腾腾的汤池。。。十分享受。。。由于是内陆城市，。。消费水准还是低于沿海城市的酒店的服务意识不错，。。性价比很高。。,"The environment is very good.EssenceThe price of Ctrip in the off -season also encountered some problems during the process of seduction.EssenceBut Ctrip still has a little influence.EssenceAfter repeated urging, it was solved successfully.EssenceEssenceIt is really good to praise the five -star level, and the hot springs are worthy.Being in the forest.EssenceFacing Cui Lake.EssenceDrizzle.EssenceAnd the hot soup pond.EssenceEssenceVery enjoyable.EssenceEssenceBecause it is inland cities.EssenceThe consumption level is still a good awareness of service of hotels lower than coastal cities.EssenceThe cost performance is very high.Essence"
1,"房间不错,价格贵了点,不过房间有电脑蔓好的,房间视野很好,这次前台服务稍好点,","The room is good and the price is a bit expensive, but the room has a good computer, and the room vision is very good. This time the front desk service is better."
1,走出武夷山的客房犹如进入了景区，晨雾缭绕，空气清新。酒店区位的确是武夷山独一无二的。我住的是5号楼（普通标房）房间是旧了点但够干净哦。很有特色的水帘餐厅就在楼下，边享用美食边观赏落地窗外的巨大水幕，别有情趣哦，我连着两晚都在那里用餐，不错不错！,"The guest room from Wuyi Mountain is like entering the scenic area. The morning mist is lingering and the air is fresh.The hotel's location is indeed unique to Wuyishan.I live in Building 5 (ordinary benchmarking house).The very distinctive water curtain restaurant is downstairs, enjoying the huge water curtain outside the floor -to -ceiling window while enjoying the food. Don't be interesting. I dine there for two nights."
0,1、我在网上预定的时间是13号到16号，我是13号下午四点多到前台办理入住手续（本人认为这个时间段应该不是在她们最困最累的时候）前台给我登记成13号到14号，导致14号当天钥匙被刷打不开门。2、对于酒店“免费”给我升级的房间，并没有觉得“优越”在哪里。我住452房间，好像如家很喜欢给免费升级的客人安排在最边缘的房间；房间的窗子因为上冻关不上，凌晨2点多洗手间的门居然锁上打不开，（还好是从外面锁上的，否则在里面锁上又没有电话的情况下，估计再出来要变成木乃伊了）最后还是要叫来服务员来打开。3、我进出酒店路过前台数次只有四次听见他们打招呼，一次看见一个礼宾部的男士的微笑；相反在走廊里见到客房部的服务员却总是和我打招呼说“您好”。4、房务员的打扫的确很干净认真，遗憾的是从我入住的那天开始就被告知浴帘正在清洗（到我退房的那天仍在清洗当中），所以每天都要小心翼翼的进出洗手间，否则一个不留神就会滑倒。5、入住期间，非常“荣幸”的赶上酒店连续断电两次，可怜我的电脑了。补充点评2008年2月19日：补充：暖气不热，洗好的袜子，放在暖气上一晚上居然没有干，崩溃…………,"1. The time I booked online is on the 13th to 16th. I go to the front desk to check in the procedures at 4 pm on the 13th (I think this time should not be at the most sleepy and most tired of them).On the 13th to the 14th, the key on the 14th could not be opened on the day of the 14th.2. I did not feel ""superior"" for the hotel's ""free"" room.I live in Room 452, as if Rujia likes to arrange for the free upgraded guests in the most edge of the room; because the window of the room cannot be closed because it is frozen, the door of the toilet room at more than 2 am is locked. (Fortunately, it is from the outside outside the outside.What is locked, otherwise, when there is no phone in it, it is estimated that it will become mummy again.) Finally, I still have to call the waiter to open it.3. I went in and out of the hotel to pass by the front desk only four times to hear them say hello, and once saw the smile of a man in a ritual department; on the contrary, when I saw the waiter in the room department in the corridor, I always greeted me ""Hello"".4. The cleaning of the house clerk is really clean and serious. Unfortunately, since the day I stayed, I was told that the shower curtain was cleaning (on the day of my check -up, I was still cleaned), so I had to enter and exit the bathroom carefully every day.Otherwise, one will slide without paying attention.5. During the check -in, I was very ""honored"" to catch up with the hotel twice continuously, pity my computer.Supplementary comment on February 19, 2008: Supplement: The heating is not hot, the washed socks, put it on the heating all night, did not dry, collapsed ............................"
0,这个酒店的设备很老，不像3星酒店。房间的设施像80年代的。,"The equipment of this hotel is very old, unlike the 3 -star hotel.The facilities in the room are like the 1980s."
1,"一家很好的度假型酒店,环境一流,尤其是户外的自然环境很好,房间的设施也不错.唯一有点不足的是酒店里的餐厅价格高了一点,已和香港4星酒店内的价格差不多了.温泉一般,比南京汤山的颐尚差.","A good vacation hotel, with first -class environment, especially outdoor natural environment, and the facilities in the room are also good. The only thing that is a bit insufficient is that the price of the restaurant in the hotel is a bit higher.The hot spring is generally worse than the Yishang of Tangshan in Nanjing."
0,"9月9日入住,从小事即可见一斑：浴帘比浴盆高200毫米，弄得卫生间一地水，功能丧失，不如说是遮羞布；餐厅桌布油迹斑斑，服务员总是理直气壮地回答，昨晚忘记换了。让人不可思议的是房间不能打国际长途！11日晚23时，我要打国际长途，前台首先声明不好使，建议买IC卡打（想赚卡钱吧？）。在我的坚持下开通了国际长途，但拨号后传来了中文提示：这个号码是空号......。显然没有“出国”。与前台理论，找值班经理都不解决问题，无奈，找出一张IP卡，试拨17900，无法拨通，又试拨10060（该宾馆号称用网通的电话），也不能拨通。最后用手机拨打了国际长途。电话打过，确久久不能入睡，倒不是心痛电话费过高。而是心中恐怖，万一夜里着火、被盗，我能拨打119、110吗？可爱的正宗三星级酒店！抬眼看日历，啊！9月11日--恐怖的911！！！次日提前退房离去。留下携程与你长期合作。","Check in on September 9th, and it can be seen from small things: shower curtain is 200 mm tall than the bathtub. It makes the bathroom a water and the function is lost. It is better to cover it.Forgot to change.What is incredible is that the room cannot hit the international long distance!At 23:00 on the 11th, I want to play international long distances. The front desk is not easy to make. It is recommended to buy IC cards (want to make cards?).I opened the international long distance under my persistence, but after dialing, a Chinese reminder came: This number is empty number ...Obviously there is no ""going abroad"".With the theory of the front desk, the manager of the duty class does not solve the problem. He helplessly, find a IP card, try to dial 17900, unable to dial, and try to dial 10060 (the hotel claims to use Netcom's phone), and you cannot dial.Finally, I dial the international long distance with my mobile phone.After calling, I ca n’t fall asleep for a long time. It ’s not that my heartache is too high.It was horrible in my heart. Can I call 119 and 110 in a night of fire and stolen?Cute authentic Samsung hotel!Look up and look at the calendar, ah!September 11-terrible 911!IntersectionIntersectionRoute out in advance the next day.Leave Ctrip to cooperate with you for a long time."
1,已多此入住该酒店，服务还是不错的，早餐如果可以更丰富一些就,"Check this hotel more, the service is still good, if the breakfast can be richer and more abundant, just"
1,"我住了2009,房间床头左边的睡眠灯开关不管用，右边的只能关，半夜要开灯太不方便了！街上的饭店20:30就关门了，太早了点吧。","I lived in 2009, and the sleeping light switch on the left side of the bed bed was not used. It could only be turned off on the right. It was inconvenient to turn on the light in the middle of the night!The restaurant on the street closed at 20:30, too early."
1,酒店环境，服务和去景区都很方便。因为有过被半夜问要不要特殊服务电话骚扰的经历，所以晚上一回到房间就把电话线拔掉，但是在快上床休息时响起了敲门声，LP大人去开的门，敲门的人说敲错了，哈哈！一夜不再受骚扰。,"The hotel environment, service and the scenic area are very convenient.Because I have been asked if I want to harass the phone in the middle of the night, I will pull the phone line when I return to the room at night, but when I go to bed and rest, the door sounds.People said that it was wrong, haha!No longer harassed overnight."
1,环境舒适、服务细致、价格适中。有独特三项超人之处：一是免费接机，二是有盒装品牌牛奶赠送（不像别的酒店是奶粉冲泡），三市内电话随你拨。从一名普通消费者的角度，我也借此机会谢谢和玺酒店的优质服务，也祝和玺酒店越办越好。,"The environment is comfortable, the service is meticulous, and the price is moderate.There are three unique superposter: one is free pick -up, and the other is to have a box of brand milk (unlike other hotels that are brewed with milk powder), and the phone in the three cities will be dialed with you.From the perspective of an ordinary consumer, I also take this opportunity to thank the high -quality service of Hexi Hotel, and I wish Hehe Hotel to do better and better."
1,"酒店位置很不错，就在解百后面，也好找，大堂环境布置和服务台态度都很不错，符合酒店星级标准，唯一不太满意的就是房间内部的装饰最多只有三星的水平，不是很令人满意补充点评2008年5月20日：另说明此次入住的是508元的豪华大床房，房间内空调风机声音实在是有点响，另外早餐是另外购买的，28元，不是很贵，但早餐也一般，作为四星的，可以价格再提高，把内容也提高才更符合啊宾馆反馈2008年5月21日：尊敬的宾客,感谢您的点评.我们已将您的意见传达到餐厅,以作改进.同时我们也将关注客房的装饰问题,真诚期盼您的再次光临!","The hotel location is very good, just after the solution, it is easy to find. The lobby environment layout and service desk attitude are very good. It meets the hotel star standard.Satisfactory comments on May 20, 2008: Another explanation is a luxurious large bed room of 508 yuan. The sound of air -conditioning fan in the room is a bit loud., But breakfast is also average. As a four -star, the price can be improved, and the content of the content is more in line with the feedback of the hotel.The restaurant is used as a improvement. At the same time, we will also pay attention to the decoration of the guest room, and sincerely look forward to your visit again!"
1,"大年初一入住的，是西楼的海景标房，酒店比较陈旧了，房间很小，奇怪的是不开空调都热得不行。西楼是一期，东楼是二期，但西楼更靠海。海景标房都是在楼的两面，所以看海景都需要侧头的，有点累哦。但到底是老五星了，服务效率很高，送什么都很快，酒店柜台的服务生都很殷勤和礼貌。我把携程的预订单带着为了可以看飞机时刻，结果在checkin时忘柜台了，当晚打到柜台让留着会去拿，结果转身就忘了。四天后要飞的那天才想起，打到柜台居然还在，大概五分钟后就有小弟给我送来了，很开心。另有一点,我们在酒店的咖啡厅用过一顿早餐，小姐很可爱，但是苦心等待等来的黑椒牛肉却咸涩异常，不晓得是当地人口味如此还是我们的运气不好。","The first day of the New Year's Eve was the sea -view benchmarking room in the West Tower. The hotel was relatively old and the room was very small. It was strange that it was so hot that the air conditioner was not open.The West Tower is the first phase, the east building is the second phase, but the west building is more on the sea.The sea view benchmarking rooms are on both sides of the building, so it is necessary to look at the sea view, which is a bit tired.But in the end, it is the old and five stars, the service efficiency is very high, everything is delivered quickly, and the waiters at the hotel counter are very diligent and polite.I took Ctrip's reserve order to watch the aircraft moment. As a result, I forgot the counter when I checkin. I hit the counter that night and let it go. As a result, I turned around and forgot.The day I was going to fly four days later, I remembered that the counter was still there. About five minutes later, the younger brother sent it to me. I was very happy.Another point, we have used a breakfast in the hotel's cafe. The lady is very cute, but the black pepper beef waiting for waiting is extremely salty. I do n’t know if it ’s the local people’ s taste or our luck."
0,"我非常不满意新月阁客栈，如果有零分可以选，我宁可一分也不肯给.他们的服务太差了.明明含早餐的,居然早上服务员全然不知道,还是我本人大清早冒雨出去买的。更让人心寒和气愤的是:在中秋节的早晨,服务员在我们毫不知情的情况下,把房间转卖给别人,把我和一对美国夫妇赶走了。我和周围的几家客栈谈起此事,大家都非常震惊,居然有这种人!我强烈建议大家从此以后不要在这里住了。而且价格是附近的客栈的两倍.","I am very dissatisfied with the Crescent Pavilion Inn. If there are zero points to choose, I would rather not give it a point. Their service was too bad. It was clear that the service was with breakfast, but the waiter did not know in the morning.The rain went out to buy.What is even more chilling and angry is that in the morning of the Mid -Autumn Festival, the waiter resold the room to others without knowing it, and drove me and a pair of American couples.Everyone was shocked to talk to several inns around me, and there were such people! I strongly suggest that everyone should not live here in the future.And the price is twice the nearby inn."
1,我跟老公是31号入住的c座豪华商务套间。酒店只有a座是新装的，b跟c座都是有点年代的装修。不过房间很大，跟海只有一条马路之隔。周边的环境也不错。酒店内部设施一般，但是房间还算干净。洗脸盆下水很慢，浴室的淋浴头有点脏。但跟酒店沟通后有所改进。服务还算周到。住酒店套间的住客都可以去a座享用免费健身。游泳池很干净，但是水不是恒温。这个季节游泳非常冷。总体来说，性价比还不错，但是房间内的设施还有装修需要翻新跟改进。推荐几个朋友或是跟家人旅游时居住酒店的套间。,"My husband and I are the luxury business room of Block C No. 31.The hotel is only new in Block A, and B and C are decorated with a little age.However, the room is very large, and there is only one road from the sea.The surrounding environment is also good.The internal facilities of the hotel are average, but the room is quite clean.The water washing the basin was very slow, and the shower head in the bathroom was a bit dirty.But after communicating with the hotel, it has improved.The service is pretty good.Residents who live in the hotel suite can go to Block A to enjoy free fitness.The swimming pool is clean, but the water is not constant temperature.Swimming this season is very cold.In general, the cost -effectiveness is not bad, but the facilities in the room still need to be renovated and improved.Recommend a few friends or the suite where you live with your family."
1,"房间设置不错,感觉比较新.洗手间很宽敞明亮,美中不足是洗手间的地板,稍微沾上点水就容易滑倒.早餐不错,品种比较多.服务员,门童都很热情,总得来说比较满意.","The room is set well and feels new. The toilet is very spacious and bright. The lack of beauty is the floor of the toilet. It is easy to slide down with a little water. Breakfast is good, there are more varieties. Worships, door children are very enthusiastic, they have to be more satisfied."
0,酒店很旧，很小，楼道里黑暗，其实就是个小旅馆的设施。建议不要去，吉林省宾馆还不错。,"The hotel is very old, very small, dark in the corridor, which is actually a small hotel facility.It is recommended not to go, the Jilin Provincial Hotel is not bad."
1,我是听西门子的朋友推荐选择这家酒店的，订的豪华间，总体感觉不错。酒店不大，总共7层。但装饰的很典雅精致，有点像英国的AmberleyHotel。入住时发现这里日本人倍儿多，听说是丰田的。房间是落地窗，挺干净的，可以看见花园。床还算舒服，早餐口味也不错。这里服务挺好的，没有前面朋友说的那么糟糕，听说我是西门子的还主动帮我upgrade！而且宽带免费，赞！,"I listened to Siemens's friends to recommend choosing this hotel. The luxury room I booked generally felt good.The hotel is not large, a total of 7 floors.But the decoration is very elegant and exquisite, a bit like the British Amberlyhotel.I found that there were many Japanese people here during the check -in. I heard that it was Toyota.The room is a floor -to -ceiling window, which is very clean and you can see the garden.The bed is pretty comfortable, and the taste of breakfast is also good.The service here is very good. It is not as bad as I said before. I heard that I am Siemens and actively help me upgrade!And broadband free, praise!"
1,非常不错的酒店，就像还不错的宜春一样（宜春非常干净，文明，这点在江西还是较少见的）。,"A very good hotel, just like Yichun, who is not bad (Yi Chun is very clean, civilized, which is still rare in Jiangxi)."
0,房间安排非常不合理，要穿过很远的厨房才能到达房间，闻到厨房一股做饭的味道后到了房间都没法休息；大床房间反而不能上网，而标准间能上网，不合理；服务态度也很一般。,"The room arrangement is very unreasonable. You need to pass through a long kitchen to reach the room. After smelling a taste of cooking in the kitchen, you can't rest when you arrive at the room.The service attitude is also very average."
0,太horrible了，前台的态度及其恶劣（但门童还是很热情的），给我们留的房间是1404，让她换，说没了，还强调重庆没有这忌讳的。我表态说要站在前台直到他们换房。她见此情景说给一个什么总留了一间房是1408（1404和1408的房型是一样的，没有忌讳为什么不把1404留给那人呢！可气！欺负我们携程的网民咯！），先换给我们。同志们，我和LP是午夜12点到的酒店，拿到房号是1404的房间，我看着墙上的那个钟~汗~,"Too Horrible, the attitude of the front desk is bad (but the door children are still very enthusiastic), the room I left for us is 1404. Let her change it, say no, and emphasize that Chongqing has no such taboo.I stated that they had to stand at the front desk until they changed their rooms.Seeing this scene, she said to a room for a house that was always the same as the room type of 1408 (1404 and 1408. Why not leave 1404 to that person! You are angry! Bullying our netizens in Ctrip!),Change it to us first.Comrades, LP and I are at the hotel at 12 o'clock at midnight."
1,"去之前在携城上预定的是豪华行政单间，打完折是380元，到了那里接机服务还算不错，蛮准时的。司机也应我要求先把我送到另外一个我要去的地方，而不是直接去酒店checkin。他们同时也帮我做了房间预留。办完事16：00点我进的酒店。进了房间以后发现房间很小根本没有网上说的25cm2,大家可以看我贴上去的照片，床是一面贴着墙的。因为这与我预定的信息不符,于是打电话去前台询问，前台竟然说我定的是三星标准的豪华行政单间，现在给我的是五星标准的单人间，还讽刺地说“如果你对面积有一味的追求可以帮你换回来。”态度很不客气。就算你房价是一样的，在给客人换房之前至少也应该打个招呼吧，这是最起码的尊重。何况他们所谓的五星根本不符合五星标准。房间小就不说了，洗浴品只有洗发水，没有浴袍，茶水篮里仅有一包绿茶。卫星频道大概5个吧。如果大家要去连云港，我建议大家住明珠万豪，虽然离市区稍微远一点，但是服务和环境设施要好的多。服务员也很亲切，符合他们对外挂牌的准五星水平。虽然加上明珠香榭（没住过），3家明珠同属一个老板。但感觉真的差很多。","Before going to the city, the luxury administrative single room was scheduled to be 380 yuan after the folding. It was pretty good at picking up the aircraft.The driver should also ask me to send me to the other place I want to go, instead of going directly to the hotel to checkin.They also helped me make a room reserve.After finishing the work at 16:00, I entered the hotel.After entering the room, I found that the room was very small and there was no 25cm2 that I said on the Internet. You can see the photos I posted, and the bed is on the wall.Because this is inconsistent with the information I booked, so I called to the front desk to ask. The front desk said that I was determined by the Samsung standard luxury administrative single room. Now I am a single -player room for me.Blind pursuit can help you change it. ""The attitude is very polite.Even if your house price is the same, you should at least say hello before changing the house for guests. This is the minimum respect.Besides, the five -star five -star does not meet the five -star standard.I won't say anything about the room. The bathing products are only shampoo and no bathrobes. There is only a pack of green tea in the tea basket.There are about 5 satellite channels.If you want to go to Lianyungang, I suggest that you live in the pearl. Although a little farther away from the urban area, the service and environmental facilities are much better.The waiter is also very kind, in line with the quasi -five -star level of the outside world.Although the pearl Xiangyan (never lived), the three pearls belonged to the same boss.But it feels really worse."
1,房间等设施及服务员的态度非常让人满意，尤其是前一晚吃饭的时候我不慎将围巾遗失在吃饭的位子上，第二天在总台询问的时候，总台服务员帮我找到围巾，非常感谢她们。但一楼餐厅的自助火锅及自助餐味道不尽如人意。还有因为我们晚上才入住，居然无法在二楼中餐厅就餐，一定要事先订位，才能就餐，有些遗憾。,"The attitude of facilities and waiters such as rooms and waiters is very satisfactory, especially when I ate the night before, I accidentally lost the scarf on the seat of the meal. When I asked the main station the next day, the waiter of the head station helped me find the scarf.Thank you very much.But the buffet hotpot and buffet of the first -floor restaurants are not satisfactory.Also because we only stayed at night, we couldn't dine on the second floor of the restaurant on the second floor. We must book a place in advance before we can dine. There are some regrets."
0,位置很偏，三层的小楼，实在和图片上的不符。出门要走7～8分钟到路口才能有出租车。宾馆没有电梯也就罢了，饭菜实在太难吃了！而且送餐到房间还要加收15％服务费。早上没有早餐，花了15元买了一份，端上来4个包子，2碗粥，1个鸡蛋和1杯牛奶。除了牛奶是热的其他的都是凉的。叫服务员加热，等了10分钟端来还是凉的，说是用蒸锅蒸了一下，难道不能用微波炉吗？总之，也就算个2星。严重不推荐,"The location is very biased. The three -story small building is really inconsistent with the picture.Go out for 7 to 8 minutes to the intersection to have a taxi.There is no elevator in the hotel, and the meal is really ugly!In addition, 15 % service fee will be charged to the room.There was no breakfast in the morning. I bought a copy of 15 yuan.Except for milk, it is cold.Call the waiter to heat it. After waiting for 10 minutes, it was still cold. It was said that it was steamed with a steamer. Can't you use a microwave oven?In short, even 2 stars.Seriously not recommended"
1,大堂和房间的装修豪华，很好，距离广州很近，推荐．,"The lobby and room are luxurious, very good, very close to Guangzhou, recommended."
1,定的商务大床房，房间偏小了，不过经济性酒店也就这样；环境一般，周围感觉蛮乱的，不过旁边有个易初莲花超市，买东西很方便；服务相对另2个经济型酒店算最好,"The fixed business large bed room, the room is small, but the economic hotel is the same;Hotels are the best"
1,"入住的是度假区的豪华海景房,前台给了5楼(最高6楼),然后差不多100%的海景,虽然是挂牌5星的,但是本人觉得是4星的标准,和我后来入住的5星喜来登差了蛮多的,不过整体来说还是符合他家的价钱的.","The luxury seascape room in the resort was stayed in the resort. The front desk was given the 5th floor (the highest 6th floor), and then almost 100%of the sea view. Although it was listed on 5 stars, I thought it was the standard of 4 stars.Xing Xilai has a lot of worse, but overall is still in line with the price of his family."
1,选新兴主要就是看重他的地理位置，机场大巴到门口，到西站也很近，出门逛街有地铁，紧挨城乡贸易中心和翠微。由于没有普通标间了，定的豪华标间，也没有感觉出太大差别。虽然临街，但是双层玻璃，晚上睡觉还是很安静的。服务员态度都不错，临走的时候，以为朋友的火车票落在房间了，在退房后从西站打电话给客户中心询问，还是很热心的帮助寻找，虽然最后是虚惊一场，但这点很感谢服务员！总体感觉还不错，但是和其他宾馆相比，房间小了点，价钱稍贵，但其他的卫生、环境、服务还是不错的。,"The main point of choosing emerging is to value his geographical location. The airport bus arrives at the door. It is also very close to the West Station. There are subways when you go out and go out.Because there are no ordinary standard rooms, the designated luxury bids do not feel much different.Although the streets are near the street, double -layer glass is still quiet at night.The waiter has a good attitude. When I was leaving, I thought my friend's train ticket fell in the room. I called the customer center from West Station after checking out and asked the customer center.Thank you very much!Overall feels good, but compared with other hotels, the room is a bit smaller and the price is slightly more expensive, but other sanitation, environment, and services are still good."
1,"早餐收费,品种太少!交通比较方便,离上海地铁4号线东安路走路5分钟!补充点评2008年6月27日：刷卡品种比较少,除了广发和兴业都不能用!宾馆反馈2008年7月1日：感谢您对酒店的评价。我们酒店自开张以来，凡是外卡（VISA、MASTER、JCB、运通），内卡（工商银行牡丹卡、建设银行龙卡、中国银行长城卡、招商银行信用卡）都可在酒店使用预受权和消费。同时，希望欢迎您下次光临。","Breakfast charges, there are too few varieties! Transportation is more convenient, walk 5 minutes from Dong'an Road, Shanghai Metro Line 4! Supplementary reviews June 27, 2008: There are fewer types of cards, except for Guangfa and Xingye, you cannot use it! Hotel feedback 2008 7thJanuary 1st: Thank you for your evaluation of the hotel.Since the opening of our hotel, all card cards (VISA, Master, JCB, Express), Inner Card (Industrial and Commercial Bank Peony Card, Construction Bank Dragon Card, Bank of China Great Wall Card, China Merchants Bank Credit Card) can use pre -acceptance and consumption in the hotel.At the same time, I hope you are welcome to come next time."
0,地点在十字路口边上，十分嘈杂，巴士车呼啦啦直到夜里11点。房间很小，洗漱用品不全：沐浴液、洗发液和洗手液是三合一的，很不好用。服务态度不好。电话查询时总是让你听音乐等待很长时间，然后无故将你电话挂断。多算了我一份早餐。,"The location is on the crosshin, which is very noisy.The room is very small, and the washing supplies are incomplete: bath liquid, shampoo and hand -wash liquid are three -in -one, which is not easy to use.The service attitude is not good.You always let you listen to music for a long time, and then hang up your phone for no reason.I count my breakfast."
1,离海很近，坐公交也还算方便。入住当天，我预订的经济标准间被奥运火炬传递人员包下了，所以免费升级到了贵宾楼的标间，而且幸运地摸着火炬合了影。房间应该是刚装修过，很干净、宽敞，据说是按5星级标准建的。服务非常好。前台微笑多多。只要客人提要求，服务人员都会及时给予处理；对我们的问题，都会耐心解答。只是，设施还需完善，健身房关着，游泳池还在修缮。,"It is very close to the sea, and it is easy to take a bus.On the day of staying, the economic standard room I booked was included by the Olympic torch transfer personnel, so I upgraded to the standard room of the VIP building for free, and I was lucky enough to touch the torch.The room should be just renovated, clean and spacious, and it is said to be built according to 5 -star standards.The service is very good.A lot of smiles in the front desk.As long as the guests make a request, the service staff will deal with it in time; the questions that will be patient will be patient.However, the facilities need to be perfect, the gym is closed, and the swimming pool is still repairing."
1,"地点在市中心，出行方便，服务态度好。住豪华标间，宽敞，重装修较新,卫生不错，免费的矿泉水和咖啡，配的文具包很方便，较人性化，我买了一个，呵呵！。早餐丰富，烫干丝味道佳，娱乐设施比较齐全，桑拿浴比较豪华，据说在仪征是最好的，价格也不贵。","The location is in the city center. It is convenient for travel and good service attitude.Living in the luxury standard room, spacious, renovated renovation, good hygiene, free mineral water and coffee, and the stationery bags are convenient and more humane. I bought one, haha!EssenceBreakfast is rich, the hot and dry silk tastes good, the entertainment facilities are relatively complete, and the sauna baths are luxurious. It is said that Yizheng is the best and the price is not expensive."
1,酒店由假日酒店改成了千禧酒店，服务质量还不错，不过专业技能需要进一步提高--可能是有一些新人的原因吧。总体来说不错。,"The hotel has changed from a holiday hotel to a millennium hotel. The quality of service is not bad, but professional skills need to be further improved-it may be the reason why there are some newcomers.Overall is good."
1,"服务人员素质好,彬彬有礼.软硬件都很好的酒店,早餐有很好的西餐,也有当地传统小吃,值得一住.","There are good quality service personnel, ritual. Software and hardware are very good. There are good Western food for breakfast and local traditional snacks. It is worth living."
1,看过不少点评，这是第一次在携程上自己做点评，因为以前基本上没有订过酒店或机票，算是初用者。有人说好，有人说不好，但我看到大家指出这家宾馆的硬件不错，所以就选了它。去之前还有点担心呢。它位于市中心，若按郑州的古城墙的范畴来看，应该是在城内，要知道以前的城都不像现在这么大的。不过，现在的二七广场成了主角了。小浪底宾馆大楼在一堆高楼之间，建筑蛮特别的，比较以高制胜的大厦而言，似乎看上去给人一点不够宏伟的感觉。但是，走近大堂，服务员的温婉明眸一下子让略显暗色的空间亮了不少，check-in很快，网络上预定的价格也很不错，虽然我们本来是想找那种从七八百降到三百左右的房间，事实证明这间宾馆本身要价不算很高（我们住的普通标间大堂标价488）。最让人兴奋的还是诺大的房间，它的空间是配得上四星，设施也很不错，我们预定了两个房间，连经常出差住过很多酒店有国际标准的老师都说它够水准，尽管还有一些需要加强的，但是对于四星来说，基本的东西都做到了，而且服务也好。晚上我打电话要转换插头，服务员都很快的送来了。不过，似乎房间里没有snackbar和免费水果送哦。呵呵,"I have seen a lot of reviews. This is the first time that I have made some reviews on Ctrip, because I have not booked a hotel or ticket before, which is a first use.Some people say yes, some people say it is not good, but I see that everyone pointed out that the hardware of this hotel is good, so I chose it.I was a little worried before going.It is located in the center of the city. If it is based on the category of the ancient city wall of Zhengzhou, it should be in the city. You must know that the city was not as big as it is now.However, the current Erqi Plaza has become the protagonist.In the small waves, the building is quite special between a bunch of high -rise buildings. As far as the high -winning building, it seems that it looks a little magnificent.However, when approaching the lobby, the waiter's gentle eyes made a little dark space lighten up a lot, Check-in quickly, and the price scheduled on the Internet was very good, although we originally wanted to find the kind of from seven or eight eight eight eight eightIt has dropped to about 300 rooms, and it turns out that the price of the hotel itself is not very high (the price of the ordinary bidding lobby we live in is 488).The most exciting thing is Nuo Da's room. Its space is worthy of four stars, and the facilities are also very good. We book two rooms. Teachers who have often traveled many hotels with international standards say that it is high enough.Although there are still some that need to be strengthened, for the four stars, the basic things are done and the service is good.In the evening, I called to change the plug, and the waiters were sent quickly.However, it seems that there is no SnackBar and free fruit in the room.hehe"
0,地段可以，这大概是唯一的优点了。房间小，配置简陋，简直没法洗澡。最要命的是没有暖空调，冻的要命。不过前台服务员态度可以。,"The location is OK, this is probably the only advantage.The room is small, the configuration is simple, and it is simply unable to take a bath.The most terrible thing is that there is no warm air conditioner, frozen.But the front desk waiter's attitude is okay."
1,"总体来说,还不错,就是价格不怎么样,如果能再便宜一点更好,呵呵","Overall, it's not bad, but the price is not good. If it can be cheaper, it is better, haha"
1,这间酒店真的很不错，回来后我有强烈向同事推荐这间．推荐我订这间酒店的朋友也是经常住这间的。出门右边有间鞋店款式不错．酒店里有免费的饮料（每天８瓶），还有免费的全国长途．步行到西湖很近，去夜市也很近，反正就是购物休闲商务都非常方便的一间酒店！唯一美中不足的是，在酒店房间里没什么景色可以看，都是外面破破烂烂的房子，真的是美丽的西湖，破烂的杭．不过，这次西湖行真的很值回票价，这间酒店也另我的行程增色不少．宾馆反馈2008年7月1日：尊敬的宾客，感谢您的点评。我们将继续努力为宾客创造一个满意的居留、消费之所，期待着您的再次光临！,"This hotel is really good. After I came back, I strongly recommend this to my colleagues.It is recommended that my friends who book this hotel often live in this room.There is a good style of the shoe shop on the right side of the house.There are free drinks (8 bottles per day) in the hotel, as well as free national long distances.Walking to West Lake is very close, and it is very close to the night market. Anyway, it is a hotel that is very convenient for shopping and leisure business!The only beautiful thing is that there is no scenery in the hotel room to see. It is a tattered house outside. It is really beautiful West Lake and the tattered Hang.However, this time the West Lake Bank is really worth the fare, and this hotel also has a lot of color increase.Hotel feedback on July 1, 2008: Dear guests, thank you for your comments.We will continue to work hard to create a satisfactory residence and consumption place for guests, and look forward to your visit again!"
0,环境一般，卫生间不够合理，服务总台的服务待提高;距离浦东机场较远。,"The environment is generally, the bathroom is not reasonable, and the service of the service platform is to be improved; it is far from Pudong Airport."
0,卫生条件、服务水平和服务质量都只能用有差来形容,"Sanitary conditions, service level and service quality can only be described as poor"
1,"交通方便,环境优美,很幽静,空气也很清新补充点评2008年5月4日：价格合算","Convenient transportation, beautiful environment, very quiet, and the air is also very fresh supplement."
0,"房间很差,感觉像有鬼一样,服务也很差,水要自己要才给,总之这个酒店绝对不推荐!","The room is very poor, it feels like there are ghosts, and the service is very poor. The water must be given by itself. In short, this hotel is definitely not recommended!"
1,很喜欢，而且解放北路也很漂亮，住这里晚上出来散步很好,"I like it very much, and Jiefang North Road is also very beautiful. It ’s good to live here to take a walk at night."
1,"酒店的房间很舒服,但是打电话询问酒店位置的时候前台说不清楚;餐厅由于要接待团队就不能为散课服务,而且理直气壮.","The hotel's room is very comfortable, but it is unclear when calling the hotel location; the restaurant cannot serve the dismissal because of the reception team, and it is strong."
1,先赞一下上服假日山庄，起初订的是小木屋，但由于人数过多，分别参观了其小木屋和豪华高级套房，木屋依山而立，错落有序，茫茫雨中给人一种置身世外的感觉，唯一缺点可能是隔音确实不好，毕竟是木质建筑，２层楼房走动会有声音，豪华套房宽敞，空间感大，现代感较强．此酒店适合自有车用户，如步行去市中心需走２公里左右，而且酒店门口很难叫到ＴＡＸＩ，因此开车或跟团旅游值得一去！最后感谢酒店服务小姐，一路旅游热情介绍路线．景点内容，很不错,"First praise the Holiday Villa, and the cabin was originally booked at first, but because of the large number of people, I visited its cabin and luxury high -end suites.The only disadvantage may be that the sound insulation is really not good. After all, it is a wooden building. There will be sound on the 2nd floor of the building. The luxury suite is spacious, the sense of space is strong, and the modern sense is strong.This hotel is suitable for its own car users. If you walk to the city center, you need to take about 2 kilometers, and it is difficult to call Taxi at the entrance of the hotel, so driving or traveling with group tourism is worth one!Finally, thank the hotel service lady, and I introduced the route for a warm travel all the way.The content of the attraction is very good"
1,"我一直住这个酒店，很好！尤其他们对老客人的态度，值得表扬！宾馆反馈2008年8月15日：尊敬的曹先生,感谢您的点评.我们将继续努力,为每位入住的宾客提供优质的服务.期待着您的再次光临!","I have been living in this hotel, very good!Especially their attitude towards old guests is worthy of praise!Hotel feedback on August 15, 2008: Dear Mr. Cao, thank you for your comments. We will continue to work hard to provide high -quality services for every guest who stays. Looking forward to your visit again!"
0,"想延迟1小时退房,被告知延迟退房按钟点房收费,每小时50元,太没有人性了.不知道提前退房有没有奖励","If you want to delay the check -out for 1 hour, the delay is told to charge the housing at the clock. It is 50 yuan per hour."
1,该酒店为北京天鸿房地产公司投资，环境较好，但距老市区和登山较远。有些房间不是很干净如RM3017，商务大床间还可以。补充点评2007年12月18日：对了，洗澡热水很不好调，建议改进,"The hotel is invested by Beijing Tianhong Housing Local Real Estate Company, with a good environment, but far from the old urban area and climbing.Some rooms are not very clean, such as RM3017, there is still a large business bed.Supplementary comment on December 18, 2007: By the way, bathing hot water is very difficult to adjust. It is recommended to improve"
1,家庭套餐的价格确实便宜，套房确实很大，但是硬件确实很粗糙，服务员的态度确实还可以，周末去度假不错，没车千万别去！,"The price of family packages is really cheap, and the suite is really large, but the hardware is really rough. The attitude of the waiter is indeed okay. Go on vacation on the weekend. Do n’t go without a car!"
0,"入住的经济客房,一开门进去浓厚的霉味,且无窗户255的房价是不值的,如果住别的酒店的话,可能会更好","The economic guest room staying in, the strong moldy smell in the door, and the housing price without window 255 is not worth it. If you live in other hotels, it may be better"
1,酒店硬件和服务都非常好，浴室内装在墙上的电视更是我首次见到的！可是，酒店地理位置不太好，附近是东莞的工厂区，沙尘滚滚，而且没有特别的旅游景点。而且酒店所属的地区是黄江镇，从常平火车站或常平市区打车过去的话一般要谈价，十五分钟的路程一般开价四、五十元。酒店也有提供免费专车往返常平火车站，一小时一斑，所以旅客们请提前致电酒店了解发车时间表。,"The hotel's hardware and services are very good. The TV in the bathroom on the wall is the first time I have seen it!However, the hotel's geographical location is not very good. Nearby is the factory area of Dongguan, with sand and dust, and there are no special tourist attractions.In addition, the area where the hotel belongs is Huangjiang Town. If you take a taxi from Changping Railway Station or Changping City, you generally talk about the price. The 15 -minute distance is generally opened at 4 to 50 yuan.The hotel also provides free special vehicles to and from the Changping Railway Station for one hour, so passengers please call the hotel in advance to learn about the departure schedule."
1,国际五星级酒店情侣档专业酒店评价（TT）：先提一句，本来并没有订峨眉山大酒店，是从峨眉山天颐温泉度假大饭店逃过来的。酒店地理位置：5分，在峨眉山山脚旁，离客运中心80米，很赞的地理位置~！可以从峨眉山上冰天雪地下来马上可以冲一个热水澡，值得推荐。酒店环境：4分，满标准的4星级酒店，可以从酒店里远眺峨眉山，酒店环境也不错。酒店客房：4分，酒店设施稍有陈旧，毕竟开业很久了，但总体来说还算不错。酒店服务：4分，进门一直有人拉门的，前台态度也不错，就是办checkout的时候信用卡预授权撤销做成消费取消了，导致一直不成功，如此基本功要多多培训。免费早餐：3分，在宴会厅内用早餐，总体比天颐要好很多。总的来说，表现中规中矩的四星级酒店，酒店稍嫌陈旧一些，这一点在酒店基本只有标准间很少大床房上也能体现出来，但和390的价格相比性价比不错。,"International Five -Star Hotel Couple Professional Hotel Evaluation (TT): First of all, it was not ordered to order Emeishan Hotel, which was escaped from Emeishan Tianyi Hot Spring Resort Hotel.Hotel geographical location: 5 points, next to the foot of Emei Mountain, 80 meters away from the passenger center, very good geographical location ~!You can go down from the ice and snow from Mount Emei. You can go to a hot bath immediately, which is worth recommending.Hotel environment: 4 points, full of standard 4 -star hotels, you can overlook Mount Emei from the hotel, and the hotel environment is also good.Hotel rooms: 4 points, hotel facilities are slightly old, after all, it has been opened for a long time, but it is generally good.Hotel service: 4 points, there have been people who have a door in the door, and the attitude of the front desk is also good. It is that the credit card pre -authorization is revoked to be canceled when it is checkout. As a result, it has been unsuccessful.Free breakfast: 3 points, breakfast in the banquet hall is much better than Tianyi.Generally speaking, the four -star hotels with a satisfactory performance are slightly old. This is basically that the standard room can only be reflected in the standard room, but the price is good compared to the price of 390."
1,看到前面好坏参半的评价，定的时候还有点犹豫的。不过去到那里，觉得超值的。酒店有自己的码头，在厦门轮渡码头（面向大海的右手边）往前100米就可以看到，一进一出相当于绕鼓浪屿一周，住客单程3块，就这一点，已经加分了。酒店门口就是海滨浴场，在那里可以一直可以看到披着酒店大浴巾出去和湿漉漉回来的住客，让自己也忍不住有往大海纵身一跳的欲望。服务员也非常有礼貌，我们在他们中餐厅吃晚饭时，我们说怕有蚊子，服务员就主动拿来了蚊香，很贴心。中餐厅的菜也OK，白米饭很香哦。至于房间设施，不算豪华也不算新，但已够用，而且有个大阳台，站在那里看海吹风听涛，非常惬意。如果是喜欢游泳而且希望游完泳可以马上会自己房间洗澡的朋友，这里一定适合。酒店离龙头商圈较远（步行15分钟吧），但离日光岩和菽庄花园很近，所以酒店周围算是安静型的环境。我们下午到了先小睡一下，然后游泳，然后洗澡，在酒店吃饭，晚饭后就逛到龙头路，然后再慢慢从海边踱回酒店，一早起来在海边散步再游泳，觉的那怎一个安逸。这里绝对是我下次来鼓浪屿住的不二只选。,"Seeing the evaluation of the good and bad ginseng in front, I was a little hesitant when I set it.But when I go there, I feel value for value.The hotel has its own pier. It can be seen 100 meters in the Xiamen Wharf Terminal (right -handed on the right side of the sea). As soon as you enter and one go around, the resident is one -way.EssenceAt the entrance of the hotel is the seaside bath, where you can always see residents who go out and wet from the hotel's big bath towel, so that you can't help but have the desire to jump into the sea.The waiter was also very polite. When we had dinner in their Chinese restaurant, we said that they were afraid of mosquitoes, and the waiter took the initiative to bring mosquito coils, which was very intimate.The Chinese restaurant's dishes are also OK, and white rice is very fragrant.As for the room facilities, it is not luxurious and not new, but it is enough, and there is a big balcony. It is very pleasant to stand there to watch the sea blowing and listen to the waves.Friends who like to swim and want to swim after swimming can take a bath immediately, it must be suitable.The hotel is far away from the leading business district (15 minutes walk), but it is close to Nikko Rock and Yizhuang Garden, so the hotel is a quiet environment.When we arrived in the afternoon, we swimd, then took a bath, ate at the hotel, wandered to the leader after dinner, and then slowly walked back to the hotel from the seaside, woke up early in the morning and swim on the seaside.Here is definitely the best choice for me to live in Gulangyu next time."
1,"观海木楼建筑别致,风景优美,环境幽静,绝佳的度假胜地,8628房间位置极好.只是每天不是24小时热水供应,很不方便.中餐厅的芒果螺(蒜蓉粉丝蒸)味道好极了!米饭又软又香!","Watching the sea building building is unique, beautiful scenery, quiet environment, excellent resort, 8628 rooms are in good location. Just not 24 hours of hot water supply every day, it is not convenient.Good! The rice is soft and fragrant!"
1,"日本人真的是超多,老酒店房间布局还可以，就是地毯怪味太多,房间空气不太好，窗户不好打开。服务还行，交通方便，去火车站、快轨、景点都很方便，就是在火车站旁边环境比较乱。房间价格稍贵，基本上还比较有竞争力。","The Japanese are really superior. The layout of the old hotel room is okay. It is that the carpet has too many strange flavor, the room air is not very good, and the windows are not easy to open.The service is okay, the transportation is convenient, and it is very convenient to go to the train station, fast rail, and attractions, that is, the environment next to the train station is more chaotic.The price of the room is slightly more expensive and basically competitive."
1,其他还好，就是早餐一般。酒店设施没有其他城市的喜来登出色。宾馆反馈2008年8月8日：感谢您选择下榻本酒店！最近本酒店新上任的新加坡籍行政主厨，正在根据客人的反馈对菜肴进行改进，同时近期也有不少新的餐饮促销推广活动，相信下一次的体验肯定不会让您失望。欢迎您再次入住，衷心祝您身体健康，工作顺利!,"The other is okay, just breakfast.The hotel facilities do not have Xilai in other cities.Hotel feedback on August 8, 2008: Thank you for choosing to stay in the hotel!Recently, the newly -held Singaporean administrative chef in this hotel is improving the dishes based on the feedback of the guests. At the same time, there are also many new catering promotion promotion activities. I believe that the next experience will definitely not disappoint you.You are welcome to stay again and sincerely wish you good health and work smoothly!"
1,房间面积蛮大的，我住的普通房的洗手间设施稍显陈旧，但是很干净，看了一下商务房，是后装修的，很不错。网络偶尔不稳定，可能是插头的地方有点松，稳定的时候下载速度超级快，爽的！早餐中规中矩，还行。靠马路的房间没有入住，不清楚情况，不靠马路的这边很安静。可以订火车票，手续费收的不高，很方便。,"The room area is quite large. The toilet facilities in the ordinary room I live are slightly old, but it is very clean. I looked at the business house. It was renovated. It was very good.The Internet occasionally is unstable. It may be that the plug is a bit loose. When it is stable, the download speed is super fast, cool!Breakfast is satisfactory and okay.The room on the road is not checked, and the situation is not clear. It is quiet without relying on the road.You can order train tickets. The handling fee is not high, which is very convenient."
0,房价较贵，位置也比较偏，房屋隔音效果较差。屋外说话，里面的清清楚楚。不是每间房间都有宽带，我第二天换了一件有宽带的，不过网速也慢。我入住的时候，在携程上定房价格是320，但是入住第二天发现携程上这家酒店的价格降到了300元，和前台商量，居然不肯给我降价。我出差本来住挺长时间，不过在这家酒店住了2天，赶快抽空在市内找了另外一家酒店。不但价格便宜很多，网速也快，而且房屋干净漂亮多了。拉萨酒店价格变动大，旺季价格很高，淡季价格很便宜。另外，这边住店一般都要和经理讲价，我后来住的酒店和他们客房经理商量，房价比到前台直接开房便宜了50元。经济型酒店经常爆满。,"House prices are more expensive, the location is relatively biased, and the sound insulation effect of the house is poor.Talking outside the house, clearly inside.Not every room has a broadband. I changed a broadband the next day, but the speed of the network was also slow.When I stayed, the price of a fixed house on Ctrip was 320, but the second day of staying, I found that the price of this hotel on Ctrip was reduced to 300 yuan.I lived in a business trip for a long time, but I lived in this hotel for 2 days, and quickly took the time to find another hotel in the city.Not only is the price cheaper, the speed of the network is fast, but the house is much more clean and beautiful.The price of the Lhasa Hotel has changed a lot, the price of the peak season is very high, and the off -season price is very cheap.In addition, the shops here generally have to talk to the manager. The hotel where I lived later and their guest room managers discussed that the house price was 50 yuan cheaper than opening the house by the front desk.Economy hotels are often full."
1,首先回顾一下本人2007年9月14日的部分点评――“唯一感觉比较欣慰的是可以不用再蹲着或者弯腰收拾行李了――在本人此前的N次投诉后，酒店终于在房间内增加了行李架。。。”可是，这次预定的“豪华间”（也就是此前本人入住N次的6楼“行政间”），居然又找不到行李架了，一时无语。。。这，对老客户也太不尊重了吧？？？！！！我不知道银帆是如何管理客户信息的，但是有些酒店，如果入住一次的话，系统里就会有客户的信息，下次入住的时候酒店就能预先根据客户的喜好做相应的安排。。。如果行李架不是“豪华间”的标配，至少知道（当然，如果酒店的系统没有保留记录的话，那么是不会“知道”的）本人来了，好歹也给临时安排一个吧。。。唉，不知道应不应该套用一句老话，朽木不可雕也。,"First of all, look back at some of the comments on September 14, 2007- ""The only thing I feel more comfortable is that I can no longer squat or bend over my luggage -after my previous complaints, the hotel finally increased in the room in the room.I have a luggage rack ...

1,"这次入住有个问题,我们有位同事去前台咨询早餐在什么地方,前台服务员头也不抬,用手一挥,说在左边.让我同事很不满,希望以后要注意",There is a problem in this time. A colleague of our colleagues go to the front desk to consult where the breakfast is. The front desk waiter does not lift the head of the front desk and waves with our hands to say that it is dissatisfied with my colleagues. I hope to pay attention in the future.
1,总体来说，很喜欢索菲特，这一次本来不想住索菲特，因为藏独事件，但客人喜欢，总体感觉不错。,"Overall, I like Sofitt very much. This time I didn't want to live in Sofitt, because of the Tibetan independence incident, but the guests liked it, and the overall feels good."
0,携城预定员极力推荐这家酒店，相信她才入住了这家，结果到了酒店才发现，连一星级都不如，前台的小姐穿着自家的衣服，慢不经心地回答着问题，大堂里一个人也没有，所有的服务部门都关着门（商场、足浴等）入住好后一进房间差点没被两只蚊子同时夹功，这么冷的天哪来的蚊子呀？奇怪，酒店真有本事！床单没洗，脏得要命。实在看不下去要求换房。晚上要总台送把水果刀和汤勺，得到的回复是没有这项服务，晕倒！！更搞笑的是，原本预定时说是含早餐，结果问前台，说是没有早餐，退我们二十块钱，再次晕倒！连基本的服务都办不到，还开什么酒店！！！我对酒店没有太大的意见，对携城到是有很大的意见，我们是你们的钻石会员，怎么给我们推荐这样的酒店，给我们的客户造成了不可磨灭的坏印象，如果这样的话我们以后宁愿不选择通过贵司预定。,"The pre -reservation workers who brought the city strongly recommended this hotel. I believe she stayed in this house. As a result, she found that even a star was not as good as the front desk.There is no one. All the service departments closed the door (shopping mall, foot bath, etc.) and almost did not be pinched by two mosquitoes at the same time as soon as they entered the room. Where is such a cold day?Strange, the hotel is really the ability!The sheets were not washed and dirty.I really can't stand up to ask for a house.In the evening, the main station is required to send the fruit knife and a spoon.IntersectionWhat is even more funny is that the original scheduled time to say that it contained breakfast.

0,单人间实在太小了，桌子柜子都没有，连放旅行包的地方都没有，吃饭只能坐在床上，拉唯一的椅子当桌子，不通过携程预定的话，这个房子150只要98，算特价房了！,"The single room is too small, there is no table and cabinet, there is no place to put a travel bag. You can only sit on the bed and pull the only chair as a table.It's!"
1,房间不错，给我们免费升级到了贵宾楼，服务也很好，就是贵宾楼的出行不方便，坐车要坐宾馆的电瓶车到路口才可以打到车；或者他们宾馆也有车，但是价格是出租车的一倍。总的来说要是贵宾楼平时的价格也在340的话就很不错了。,"The room is good. Give us free upgrade to VIP tower. The service is also very good. It is inconvenient to travel in the VIP building. You can take the battery car in the hotel to the intersection to get the car.Double.In general, if the price of the VIP building is usually 340, it will be very good."
1,酒店的位置不错，而且在一片五星级酒店之中（中州皇冠、索菲特，还有中州快捷等），对面就是省政府、省公安厅，旁边旅游局办事处订机票、火车票都极其方便。说了这么多就是觉得酒店房间作为商务用来说稍微挤了一些。,"The hotel's position is good, and in a five -star hotel (Crown of Zhongzhou, Sofitt, and Zhongzhou Express, etc.), opposite is the Provincial Government, the Provincial Public Security Department.convenient.After saying so much, I feel that the hotel room is squeezed a bit for business."
1,位置好，房间大，服务到位，是商务和出差的首选。,"The location is good, the room is large, and the service is in place, which is the first choice for business and business trips."
1,地处中街商业圈，交通方便，但房间所有开关按钮无标示，刚入住有些不适应。另外房间设施相对略现陈旧。,"It is located in the Zhongjie Commercial Circle, which is convenient for transportation, but all the switch buttons in the room are not marked. It is a bit uncomfortable just in check -in.In addition, the room facilities are relatively old."
1,还不错，就是能够提供湖景大床房就好了，因为酒店是有这种房间型号的，不知道为什么携程不提供！,"It's not bad, just to provide a large bed room in the lake, because the hotel has such a room model, I don't know why Ctrip does not provide it!"
1,"酒店的硬件我觉得很满意,总体来说比那个叫玉华苑的酒店好多了呢!个方面都蛮方便,不过服务方面要加大改进!!!!!!!!","I feel very satisfied with the hardware of the hotel. Generally speaking, it is much better than that hotel called Yuhua Garden! It is quite convenient in terms of aspect, but the service should be improved !!!!!!!!!"
1,"怎么说呢?勉强够五星吧,不过在小城市里,应该是不错的了.位置是好的,交通也好,景观也好.早餐一般般,主要是入住率很低的样子,没什么人吃,自助餐东西放不多也不怪了.遇到的最大的问题-我们住了两间,一间我带孩子,一间我父母,第一天在9楼,面江,结果当晚4楼的歌舞厅吵得不得了,居然要闹到午夜2点,我父母吃了安眠药还不能入睡,半夜里要求换房.换到16楼不面江,安静了.不过这么折腾一下,几乎一夜没睡.16楼是好一等的楼层,没有要求补差价,但这是酒店造成的原因,所以也没什么不应该.","What to say? Barely enough, but in small cities, it should be good. The location is good, the traffic is good, and the landscape is good. The breakfast is generally low., Don't blame the buffet food. The biggest problem we encountered-we lived two, one I took my child, one of my parents, on the first day on the 9th floor, the face of the river.The song and dance hall was so noisy that it was at 2 o'clock in the midnight. My parents could not fall asleep after taking sleeping pills. I asked to change the house in the middle of the night.The 16th floor is a good floor, and there is no request to make up the difference, but this is why the hotel is caused, so there is nothing that should not be."
0,看了大家的评价不错，才选择这家的。房间无论如何不能说是三星的标准，个人感觉不如如家布置得温馨。,"After seeing everyone's evaluation, I chose this one.No matter what the rooms can't be said to be Samsung's standard, I personally feel that it is not as warm as home."
1,家庭套餐的房间有一张双人大床金和一张单人床很贴心。餐厅的鸡汤很好喝。射箭飞镖桌球那里没有工作人员没玩到，钓鱼竿有点破，真的想钓鱼最好自己带钓具，除了饭店内的小池塘附近有个小水库可以钓鱼，我家的孩子很喜欢水库附近的小溪可以淌水。水库的水很干净但很冰冷有几个当地的孩子还在水库里游泳，尽管那里竖着“禁止游泳”的牌子。,"There is a two -person big bed gold and a single bed in the room of the family package.The chicken soup in the restaurant is delicious.No staff at the archery dart billiards did not play. The fishing rod was a bit broken. I really want to fish for myself. Except for a small reservoir near the small pond in the restaurant, there is a small reservoir to fish. My child likes the stream near the reservoir.Can flow water.The water in the reservoir is very clean but cold. Several local children are still swimming in the reservoir, although there is a ""prohibited swimming"" sign."
1,清明一家人去了，酒店在湿地公园的入口处附近，环境非常好，门前有一个池塘，散落一些桌椅，房子是乡村民居格式的，环境很好，没事在那里喝茶，发呆都可以。酒店的饭菜也不错，环境也可以，就是价格贵了一些。以后去杭州还会去那里的。比市区的喧嚣好多了。,"The Qingming family went, and the hotel was near the entrance of the wetland park. The environment was very good. There was a pond in front of the door, scattered some tables and chairs.EssenceThe food of the hotel is also good, and the environment is OK, but the price is more expensive.I will go there in Hangzhou in the future.It is much better than the hustle and bustle of the city."
1,"大床房房间很好,住的很舒服;卫浴设备比较新不错,达到了三星标准;早餐不算太丰富,最好的就是很安静.周遍是最繁华的解放路和鼓楼等,方便出行.房间的宽带极","The big bed rooms are very good and live comfortably; the bathroom equipment is relatively new and good, and the Samsung standard is reached; the breakfast is not too rich, the best is very quiet.The broadband of the room"
1,服务很好。硬件设施3星，服务可以到4星。从我下车，到房间，行李都有人帮忙提着，就没碰我的手。车位少，需要提前告知预留车位。位置非常好，就在市政府不远，到码头、海边都很近。不过不是临海的酒店。卫生也不错，就是热水比较小。总体来说，服务很好，卫生很好，硬件就是正常的3星。,"The service was excellent.3 stars in hardware facilities, service can reach 4 stars.From me to get off the bus, to the room, someone in luggage helped to hold it, so I didn't touch my hand.There are few parking spaces, and you need to inform the parking space in advance.The location is very good. It is not far from the municipal government, and it is very close to the dock and the seaside.But it is not a hotel in Linhai.Hygiene is also good, that is, the hot water is relatively small.Overall, the service is very good, the hygiene is very good, and the hardware is the normal 3 star."
0,酒店一般般。服务态度也不是很好，主要是人家太忙了。需要等很长时间。要不是要办事里那里很近；应该不会再住这个了。没有停车的地方。只能停在旁边的有个很大的洗浴的地方。不过那里不错，有兴趣的朋友可以去试试：）,"The hotel is general.The attitude of service is not very good, mainly because people are too busy.Need to wait a long time.If it wasn't for the work, it was very close; it should not live this anymore.No parking.There is only a large bathing place next to it.But there are good, interested friends can try :)"
0,住过不少三、四星级的酒店，青海宾馆是最让人失望的一家。看到网上的照片还不错，实际上相差很大。酒店比较陈旧，无论是房间的颜色还是房间内的家具设施，感觉象是一个90年代的招待所。我订的是大床间，床直对着厕所的门，浴室里的毛巾也是黑糊糊的，感觉洗不出来的那种感觉。晚上有骚扰电话，而且房间的隔音也不好。有意思的是，我想把行李寄存在酒店一下，那个问讯处的小姐就拿一张纸写了一个收条给我，连个正规点的单据也没有，可见管理的不足，也不知道怎么评上四星的。所以，第二天我就另某住处了。,"Living in many three or four -star hotels, Qinghai Hotel is the most disappointing one.Seeing the photos on the Internet is not bad, it is actually very different.The hotel is relatively old. Whether it is the color of the room or the furniture facilities in the room, it feels like a guest house in the 1990s.I booked a large bed, the bed was facing the door of the toilet, and the towels in the bathroom were also dark, and I felt the feeling that I couldn't wash.There are harassment calls at night, and the sound insulation in the room is not good.Interestingly, I want to store my luggage in the hotel. The lady who asked the question office wrote a piece of paper to me, and I did not even have a regular document.Four stars.So, the next day I was another residence."
0,汽车站下来后碰到了几个酒店拉客的，喋喋不休，于是通过携程预订了这个酒店。曲阜不大，酒店在曲阜城的北关，从车站过去大概1公里左右，后来坐一个三轮车过去的。4快钱比想象中的要便宜。酒店就是80年代的镇里面的招待所的感觉，大厅黑压压的，过道中N多垃圾，没人打扫，房间里地毯黑乎乎的，房间又小。马桶里也黑乎乎的。。。。另外问前台服务员有没有曲阜直达上海大巴，均被告知不知道。结果只好预订了济南回上海的飞机，第2天早上去车站坐车去济南的时候，顺便问了下售票员说曲阜到上海的大巴有好几班，特别是下午1～3点间有好多济宁等地去上海的过路车经过的。。。但机票已经预订好了，只好返回济南再坐飞机回去的。在离酒店100多米的地方有个曲阜国际青年旅舍，看起来不错，应该挺干净的，家庭房价格也就120块，比裕隆便宜，建议下次大家去这儿住。补充点评2008年5月2日：哪儿有水果送？？？估计今年改了。,"After getting down the bus station, I met a few hotels to pull customers, chatting, so I booked the hotel through Ctrip.Qufu is not large. The hotel in the North Pass in Qufu City, about 1 kilometer from the station, and later took a tricycle.4 fast money is cheaper than expected.The hotel is the feeling of the hostel in the town in the 1980s. The hall is dark. There are N garbage in the aisle. No one cleans up. The carpet in the room is dark and the room is small.The toilet is also dark.EssenceEssenceEssenceIn addition, I asked whether the front desk waiters had to reach the Shanghai bus directly, and they were told that they did not know.As a result, I had to book a plane that Jinan returned to Shanghai. On the morning of the second day, when I went to the station to take a car to Jinan, I asked the tickets to say that there were several classes from the bus from Qufu to Shanghai, especially from 1 to 3 pm.Passing the road to Shanghai.EssenceEssenceBut the ticket has been reserved, so I had to return to Jinan and then take a plane back.There is a Qufu International Youth Hostel more than 100 meters away from the hotel. It looks good and it should be very clean. The price of home houses is 120 yuan, which is cheaper than Yulong. It is recommended that you stay here next time.Supplementary comment on May 2, 2008: Where is the fruit sent?IntersectionIntersectionIt is estimated that this year has changed."
0,酒店涨价了，可是性价比并没有国内如家的好！不知道酒店啥原因价格比如家还高点，总体来说还是比如家差点！,"The price of the hotel has increased, but the price -performance ratio is not as good as home!I do n’t know what the reason for the hotel is high, as far as the home is still high, in general, it is almost home!"
0,"6楼窗外就是整幢大楼的风机,非常吵!可能是存心留给携程的客人,第二天到下午四点回房还没清洁房屋,太离谱!!!!!","Outside the window of the 6th floor is the fan of the entire building, which is very noisy! It may be left to the guests of Ctrip. The house is not cleaned at 4 pm the next day, it is too outrageous !!!!!"
0,住过的如家里最差的一家，登记入住时说房间还没整理好，要等40分钟，等吧！40分钟后如果不是我主动去问，也没人来通知你可以入住了，也许又是40分钟！标准B间房间在一楼，较小，这倒无所谓，房间里异味较重，这也罢了，关键在于房间里闹鼠患！半夜2：30厕所里一声巨响，一看是厕所吊顶掉下来一块，小水泥块掉了一地，一只硕大的老鼠掉了下来，在房间里蹿了一圈后又爬了回去，第一次在宾馆里碰到这种情况，实在扫兴！建议如家能关心此事，灭绝鼠患。因为前一天住的是洛阳如家（王城公园店），两家真是有云泥之别！省会城市的宾馆啊！希望能争气一点！,"The worst one in the family who lived in the family said that the room had not been sorted out when registering, and wait 40 minutes, wait!After 40 minutes, if I did not ask, no one would notify you to stay, maybe 40 minutes!The standard B room is on the first floor, which is smaller. This does not matter. The smell in the room is heavy. This is also the key to hautoring the room in the room!At 2:30 in the middle of the night, there was a loud noise in the toilet. At first glance, the toilet ceiling fell down, and the small cement was dropped one ground. A huge mouse fell down and climbed back after a lap in the room.When I encountered this in the hotel once, it was really disappointed!It is recommended that the family can care about this matter and extin the mice.Because the day before was the Luoyang Rujia (Wangcheng Park), the two really had cloud mud!Hotels in the provincial capital!Hope to be angry!"
1,装修和服务一流，但房间的床有点偏小，卫生间浴缸旁连放脚垫的地方度没有。另外床头灯不可调节。旁边的新开元酒店的饭菜不错，很好的一个去处。下次定个豪华间也许待遇会好些。,"The decoration and service are first -rate, but the bed in the room is a bit small, and the place where the foot pads are placed next to the bathtub.In addition, the bedside lights are not adjusted.The food of Xinkaiyuan Hotel next to it is good, a good place.The next luxury room may be better."
1,环境还可以，就是空调太差，没什么温度。热水器没法说了，洗一半热水就没了，后面烧2个小时水都不热，换了房间还是如此，烧了一整夜第二天早上才有澡洗，我想我不会再去那了。,"The environment is okay, that is, the air conditioner is too bad and there is no temperature.The water heater could not be said, and the hot water was gone for half of the water. It was not hot to burn the water for 2 hours in the back. The room was changed. It was still the next night after the whole night.Go there."
1,在桐乡是不错的选择，大堂很大。打车方便。,"It is a good choice in Tongxiang, and the lobby is large.It is convenient to take a taxi."
1,很安静，地段也不错，我是晚上十一点入住的，因为用餐时间已过，联系服务员后他们主动帮我到外面买夜宵，非常感谢。,"Very quiet, the location is also good. I stayed at 11 o'clock in the evening, because the meal time had passed. After contacting the waiter, they took the initiative to help me go outside to buy supper. Thank you very much."
1,很舒服的酒店，床很软，酒店内部的布局也很有特色，而且服务不错，因为自己没说明要双床，结果到了房间后再要求跟前台换，前台态度很好，非常及时的更换了,"A very comfortable hotel, the bed is very soft, the internal layout of the hotel is also very distinctive, and the service is good, because I did not explain the double bed. As a result, I asked to change the front desk after I arrived."
1,酒店房间-干净&简单，四星级的房间；温泉-特色温泉选择不少，人有点多，没有去过其他温泉地方，不好比较；服务-很好，工作人员很热情问候和回答问题，五星级服务；餐饮-自助晚餐丰盛，早餐一般般。,"Hotel room-clean & simple, four-star rooms; hot spring-special hot spring choices, there are a lot of people, not to other hot spring places, it is not good to compare; service-very good, the staff is very enthusiastic about greetings and answering questions, the staff is very enthusiasticFive-star service; catering-buffet dinner is rich, breakfast is average."
1,五月底去的，淡季，整个酒店就只有5位客人，真是爽。打电话要剪刀，放下电话服务员就来敲门了，速度飞快。房间：我定的是湖景房，窗外景色：湖水＋几幢独立别墅，风景如画。房内较大，有电脑上网免费。环境：适合谈恋爱，早上空气好，幽静，花园，湖水边走走，很浪漫。早餐厅环境好，有view。不适合赶时间的游客。,"At the end of May, there were only 5 guests in the entire hotel in the off -season, which was so cool.Call the scissors, put down the phone waiter and knock on the door. The speed is fast.Room: I set a lake view room with scenery outside the window: lake water + several independent villas, picturesque scenery.The room is large, and there are computer access to the Internet for free.Environment: Suitable for falling in love, good air in the morning, quiet, garden, lake water, very romantic.The breakfast is good, there is View.Tourists who are not suitable for time."
1,"环境位置很好,房间情况尚可,早餐一般般,价格偏高了一些.","The environment is very good, the room is okay, the breakfast is average, the price is higher."
0,酒店设施、环境很差，很不舒适，非常不满意！,"The hotel facilities and environment are poor, very uncomfortable, and very dissatisfied!"
0,我一般都不愿意写点评的，但这真的是我入住过的五星级酒店中，也是万丽品牌酒店中最糟糕的。房间当然牵强人意，同行的同事问我这个酒店是不是非常老了，卫浴设备也都是非常陈旧的。天津的配备跟我在苏州住过的万丽酒店简直是无法相提并论的。另外，我订的还是行政房，结果办手续的速度可以让我吃一顿早饭了，真的是非常痛苦，我们一行四人，最起码一个人办手续花了15分钟时间。还有早餐简直让我怀疑这是五星级酒店的早餐，也没有鲜榨橙汁，水果也很糟糕，时蔬更加难吃只有一个冬瓜，我一共就喝了一杯豆浆和一碗粥。,"I am generally reluctant to write comments, but this is really the worst of the five -star hotel I have been in, and it is also the worst of the Markli brand hotel.Of course, the room is far -fetched. My colleagues asked me if the hotel was very old, and the bathroom equipment was very old.The equipment in Tianjin is not comparable to the Wanli Hotel I have lived in Suzhou.In addition, I ordered the administrative house. As a result, the speed of handling the procedures can allow me to have breakfast. It is really very painful. We all four people, at least 15 minutes for one person.And breakfast made me suspect that this was breakfast of a five -star hotel, and there was no fresh -squeezed orange juice. The fruits were also bad. Times vegetables were even more unbelievable. I drank a cup of soy milk and a bowl of porridge in total."
0,补充一下：洗发水也要自备。如果您认为洗洁精同样可以洗发的话，那就无所谓啦！,Add it: Shampoo should also be prepared.It doesn't matter if you think that the detergent can also be shampoo!
1,1.房间非常棒，床特别舒服2.酒店周边环境比较差3.价格有竞争力,"1. The room is great, the bed is particularly comfortable 2. The environment around the hotel is poor 3. The price is competitive"
1,房间有红、黄、蓝三种色调。入住时，前台还主动询问选择哪种颜色的房间.床上用品很舒适.感觉是全棉的。房间虽小，但装修风格独特，值得一住。,"The room has three colors: red, yellow and blue.During the check -in, the front desk also actively asked which color room to choose. The bedding was very comfortable. It felt like a whole cotton.Although the room is small, the decoration style is unique and worth living."
1,"服务非常到位,无论工种酒店员工都很热情,有的时候不是他们的服务范畴,也会热情上来关照,酒店的花园超大,很适合散步.唯一欠缺的是酒店房间的地毯总是有一股发霉的味道,房间的被子潮乎乎的.总是软件不错,硬件有待改善.","The service is very enthusiastic about whether the employees of the work -type hotels are very enthusiastic. Sometimes it is not their service category, but also enthusiastically take care of it. The hotel's garden is large, which is very suitable for walking.Taste, the quilt of the room is tide. The software is always good, and the hardware needs to be improved."
0,晚餐吃出长头发，服务员竟不以为然！洗完澡时，发现浴巾上竟也有长头发！如家在我心目中一直是快捷酒店的楷模，但这次入住北京团结湖店，令人大跌眼镜。,"Eating long hair for dinner, the waiter didn't take it seriously!After taking a shower, I found that there are long hair on the bath towel!Rujia has always been a model of the fast hotel in my mind, but this time staying in the Beijing Tuanjie Lake Store, it is surprising."
1,周边不算很繁华，基本是在市中心的外围了，交通很比较便利，很好找。我订的是行政大床房，房间一般吧，但不够大，价格不算低，早餐品种偏少，游泳池不小，但没带泳裤，没去试试。服务水平还可以，总体感觉达标，价格合理一些，以后还会考虑入住。,"The surroundings are not very prosperous, basically the periphery of the city center. The transportation is relatively convenient and easy to find.I booked a large -scale administrative bed room. The room is average, but it is not large enough. The price is not low. The breakfast varieties are small. The swimming pool is not small, but I did n’t bring swimming trunks. I did n’t try it.The level of service is also okay. The overall feels the standard and the price is more reasonable. In the future, you will consider staying."
1,广泛看了网上的点评，最后选择了这家酒店，3楼的商务海景标间，景色确实一流，就是隔音效果差了点，原来还准备选海天，实地一看才知道原来是竖着对海，房间都是侧看海。前台听说是协程的客人，有点冷淡。大眼睛的大堂经理确实好！,"I watched the comments on the Internet extensively. Finally, I chose this hotel. The business seascape label on the 3rd floor. The scenery is indeed first -class, that is, the sound insulation effect is a bit bad. It was originally prepared to choose Haitian.The rooms are all looking at the sea.The front desk heard that it was a guest of the coroutine, a bit cold.The lobby manager with big eyes is really good!"
0,房间设备比较陈旧，没五星标准客人非常不满意,"The room equipment is relatively old, and there are no five -star standard guests very dissatisfied"
1,酒店还可以，早餐也不错，值得推荐，若价格能再低点就更好了。,"The hotel is okay, breakfast is also good, it is worth recommending, it is even better if the price can be low."
1,住了两晚。在香格里拉应该是相当高级的酒店，可能是本来期望不高，但是藏式标间还是挺大的，两个很大的单人床，每个都可以睡一大人和一小孩。房间内还有一1米8的长沙发，较宽，可以睡一大人。房内有加湿器，晚上冷，小孩要盖两层被子，否则容易着凉。早餐到9：30，品种较多，刷卡结帐很快，总体服务挺好。正赶上游泳池清理换水，不过泳池周围很漂亮，玻璃屋顶，很温暖，像到了亚热带，照了几张相。如果去香格里拉应该去好酒店，因为毕竟是个在高原的小城市，不见得还会去第二次。,"I lived for two nights.In Shangri -La, it should be a very high -end hotel. It may be that the expectations are not high, but the Tibetan standard room is still quite large. Two large single beds, each can sleep an adult and a child.There is also a 1.8 -meter long sofa in the room, which is wide and you can sleep a big person.There is a humidifier in the room. It is cold at night. The child must cover two layers of quilts, otherwise it will be easy to cool.Breakfast to 9:30, there are many varieties, the card checkout is fast, and the overall service is good.It is catching up with the swimming pool to clean up the water, but the swimming pool is very beautiful. The glass roof is very warm. It looks like a subtropical.If you go to Shangri -La, you should go to a good hotel, because after all, it is a small city in the plateau, and it may not be the second time."
1,服务应该再提升一下．怎么也要符合五星的标准啊,The service should be improved.Why do you need to meet the five -star standard?
1,入住的是套房，整体布局和装修等等都还满意。这里的书吧设施很好，携程订的客户都可以免费使用，酒店离我们办事的地点比较近，因同事提出去吃当地风味小吃，前台服务员挺热情推荐几个特色地方，整体酒店的地理位置和氛围都还不错的。,"Checking in a suite, the overall layout and decoration are still satisfied.The book bar here is very good. Ctrip's customers can use it for free. The hotel is closer to the location of our work. Because colleagues propose to eat local snacks, the front desk waiters are enthusiastic about recommending several special places. The geographical location of the overall hotel is very enthusiastic.The atmosphere is pretty good."
0,预定的时候不知道还有个西楼，到了前台才知道定在西楼，这个倒没有所谓，不过……，到了那里，得知要先结帐，这也就算了，居然不能刷卡，明明在主楼可以刷卡的，到了西楼就不能刷卡？不是故意偷逃税吗？既然打了新五洲大酒店的牌子，凭什么分开结算？在携程可没有分开登记哦，忍了，到了房间一看，更生气了，居然没有收拾……，打了电话过了10分钟才上来收拾，收拾好了发现杯子是湿的，问原因，说是当场洗得……，天哪，我还真没有遇到过这种酒店，上厕所发现没有厕纸，和她们说了，说知道了，过了半小时发现没有拿来，打电话去总台，还说知道了，等到第二天退房也没有给我们拿来，幸亏有远见，出门自带厕纸，不然，真不知道怎么从厕所里出来了……，怕第二天睡太晚，定了7：30叫早，结果7点不到，叫早电话就来了，我实在是无语了……，反正，这样的酒店，我在携程第一次遇到，不得不怀疑，现在携程的工作力度了……，下次去睡马路也不会住那里。,"I do n’t know if there is a West Tower when I book it. I only know that it is set to the West Tower at the front desk.The main building can swipe the card. Can't you swipe the card when you arrive?Isn't it deliberately evading taxes?Since the sign of the New Wuzhou Hotel, why is it separated?I did n’t register separately in Ctrip. I endured it. When I saw it in the room, I was even more angry. I did n’t pack up ... I did n’t pack it up. After I called 10 minutes, I came up to clean up.I washed it on the spot ... Oh my god, I really never encountered such a hotel. I found that there was no toilet paper in the toilet. I told them and said that I found that I didn’t get it after half an hour.Taiwan, I also said that I did n’t bring us to the next day. Fortunately, there are vision, and I have toilet paper when I go out.In the evening, I was set at 7:30 early, and the result was not until 7 o'clock. The call came early. I was really speechless ... Anyway, such a hotel, I met for the first time in Ctrip, I have to doubt.Now the work of Ctrip ..., next time I go to sleep on the road, I won't live there."
1,环境不错，室内色调很温馨，MM很满意！就是窗户收拾得太马虎了，拉开窗帘就觉得很凌乱的感觉。最不足的地方就是淋浴了，一是地方太小了，二是洗澡时水时大时小的，中间还停了几秒！！,"The environment is good, the indoor tone is very warm, MM is very satisfied!That is, the windows are too sloppy, and when the curtains are opened, it feels messy.The most disadvantage is the shower. One is that the place is too small.Intersection"
1,酒店前台效率比较低，我们在CHECK-IN的时候，有另外一个老外在CHECK-OUT，那两个前台前前后后忙活了好久，几乎就没把我们当人！相当气愤！在办理入住的时候，她们竟然连句抱歉都没有！！房间呢，还是不错的。我们是圣诞节入住的，才700块一晚，觉得很值，呵呵，这个价钱平时可是想都没法想的哦~,"The hotel's front desk is relatively low. When we check-in, we have another foreigner check-out. The two front desks have been busy with us for a long time, and we have hardly regarded us as a person!Quite angry!When they went to check in, they didn't even have a sentence sorry!IntersectionThe room is still good.We stayed at Christmas for only 700 yuan a night. It felt worth it, huh, this price usually couldn't think of it ~"
0,"对于酒店的服务态度基本满意,唯一缺陷就是没有遵守时间.我提前1小时和酒店总台确认过了我到达浦东机场的时间,并且酒店说我到的那个时间有班车在等.但在我比通知酒店的时间提前15分钟到达时,却没有酒店的班车,给总台打电话后才知道,班车已经提前开走了!结果酒店又排车来接,让我等待了25分钟!关于第二天早上出发时间的问题,我反复催促了,也是在晚上9点半以后才通知的.结果第二天的班车定在早上7点钟,但实际发车却延迟了15分钟!至少酒店的班车是没有信誉的!这样的工作态度好像很不在乎,像是在开玩笑一样!另外,酒店距离机场有至少25分钟的车程,周围也没有什么吃饭的地方.我到的当天晚饭只好在酒店餐厅解决.我只有1个人,点了个雪菜肉丝面,1个青茄子炒粉丝,结果上来的面至少够4个人吃,点菜时服务员也不提醒一下.那个青茄子炒粉丝就更甭提了,实在是难吃至极无法下咽!不知道是哪个菜有问题,当夜就上吐下泻了!可以肯定是食物中毒!酒店的小姐反复打电话到房间拉生意!实在是更加降低了酒店档次!又不敢把电话线拔掉,因为还要等待总台通知第二天早上发车时间,真是太郁闷了!188元实在是太便宜了,便宜得很难受很不合算,我永远也不会再去住这家酒店了!","The service attitude of the hotel is basically satisfactory. The only defect is that I did not comply with time. I confirmed that I had reached the Pudong Airport with the hotel's head station 1 hour in advance, and the hotel said that the time I arrived was waiting.When the hotel arrived 15 minutes in advance, there was no shuttle bus at the hotel. After calling the main station, I knew that the shuttle bus had drove away in advance! As a result, the hotel was volleyball to pick it up, let me wait for 25 minutes! About the second!The issue of departure time in the morning, I repeatedly urged, and it was notified after 9:30 in the evening. As a result, the bus the next day was set at 7 o'clock in the morning, but the actual departure was delayed for 15 minutes! At least the hotel's bus was the bus.There is no reputation! Such a job attitude does not seem to care, as if you are joking! In addition, the hotel has at least 25 minutes' drive from the airport, and there is no place to eat around. I had to solve it in the hotel and restaurant. IThere are only one person, ordered a noodles of the snow vegetables, a fans of green eggplant fried fans. As a result, the noodles came up at least 4 people to eat, and the waiter did not remind the waiter when ordering.It is really unpalatable! I do n’t know which dish is a problem, and it ’s all the way to spit it up! It is definitely a food poisoning! The lady of the hotel repeatedly called the room to pull the business! It really reduces the hotel grade! AndI dare not unplug the phone line, because I have to wait for the main station to notify the departure time the next morning, it is really depressed! 188 yuan is too cheap, it is too cheap and uncomfortable, and I will never go again. I will never go againI live in this hotel!"
0,酒店地理位置比较比较偏僻，不过穿过两条马路就是石老人沙滩。酒店前台对客人比较怠慢，特别是女服务员，脸上几乎没有表情，对客人的询问或者是要求，都不太理睬，或者就是说，你等会。感觉很不好。男服务员倒是比较热情的，这个后面我会提到。酒店房间设施感觉一般，我定的是豪华房，感觉基本符合四星要求。大床比较舒服，房间内很多物品都是需要付费才能享用，好多介绍书都是用韩文标注的，感觉我到了韩国，中文标注的字体很不明显。酒店地址偏远，附近没有什么好的饭店，酒店内的饭店也在装修，只有咖啡厅和韩国餐厅营业，想吃点中餐很难，询问前台服务员，整个就一热脸贴冷屁股，爱搭不理的样子，我们没吃就被气饱了。晚上朋友带我们去吃海鲜，结果半夜两点两人都上吐下泻，请服务员送了点止泻的药和热水过来，还不错，很快送来了。早上五点还是挺难受，因为下午要赶回程的飞机，所以打算去医院看看病尽快止泻，想请前台派个人陪我们一起去，结果前台经理（男的）态度还不错，让我们等会，结果等到6点一刻，他告知我们6：30交接班，晚班的人要回去休息，早班的人送我们去，说实话，我们那时候都特别累，拉了一晚上，当时感觉肚子也没那么疼了，也别麻烦别人了，我们就自己上楼去休息。10点钟，拉了一晚上，饿的前胸贴后背，餐厅只有自助餐，我们一点油腻的东西都没胃口碰，于是我们拖着虚弱的身子询问哪有喝粥的，结果我们是二楼跑一楼，一楼跑二楼，在询问了无数遍，上下三四次后终于得知咖啡厅有粥，我们要两份白粥，告知10元一小碗，没有配菜，切片面包，2元/片，外加15％的服务费，就这样，两碗白粥六片面包总共37元，我和妈妈开始热切怀念之前两天住的太平角如家酒店10元的自主早餐了。点完餐，因为有送餐服务，我们就先回房间去休息了，结果左等右等都没有服务员过来送，我可怜的老妈又拉又吐，脸色蜡黄，饿的要命，因为吃止泻药之前得吃点早饭垫垫。后来老妈忍不住了，催我给餐厅打电话，我翻遍房间内得说明，恁是没找到餐厅电话，老妈只好自己亲自下楼去催，结果被告知粥还在熬呢。。。。。。在好漫长得等待后，终于端来了热腾腾得白粥和面包，我们那个激动啊，终于有吃得了。后来我们把情况和服务生说了下，他说我们身体情况应该去医院，他要和酒店领导说一下，我们很是感动，说实话，到了酒店以后就这个服务生最热情了，可后来直到我们退房，也没一个电话。。。。。618元的房费，但是服务却达不到这个价格，之前我们入住的如家209元的房费我们却感觉享受了星级的服务，我想酒店的设施固然能吸引不少客人，但发自内心的微笑，真诚的服务，才是我们些客人最在乎的。,"The hotel's geographical location is relatively remote, but it is the beach of the stone old man through the two roads.The hotel's front desk is relatively negligent in the guests, especially the female waiter. There is almost no expression on her face. The inquiries or requirements of the guests are not ignored, or you can wait.It feels bad.Male waiters are more enthusiastic, I will mention this later.The hotel room facilities feel average. I set a luxurious room, which basically meets the four -star requirements.The big bed is more comfortable. Many items in the room need to be paid to enjoy. Many introductions are marked in Korean. I feel that I am in Korea. The fonts marked in Chinese are not obvious.The hotel's address is remote. There are no good restaurants nearby. The hotel in the hotel is also decorated. Only cafes and Korean restaurants are open. It is difficult to eat some Chinese food. Ask the front desk waiter.Looking at it, we were full without eating.In the evening, my friends took us to eat seafood. As a result, they spit and diarrhea at two o'clock in the middle of the night. They asked the waiter to send some medicines and hot water. It was not bad, and it was delivered soon.It was still very uncomfortable at five in the morning. Because I had to rush back to the plane in the afternoon, I planned to go to the hospital to see the illness as soon as possible, and I wanted to ask the front desk to send the person in front of me to accompany us. As a result, the front desk manager (male) was not bad.As a result until 6 o'clock, he told us that the shift was transferred at 6:30.It's not so painful, don't bother others, let's go upstairs to rest ourselves.10 o'clock, pulled one night, hungry front chest and back, the restaurant was only buffet, and we had no appetite at all, so we dragged our weak body and asked how to drink porridge. As a result, we were on the second floor.Run the first floor and run the second floor on the first floor. After asking about it countless times, after three or four times, we finally learned that there is porridge in the cafe. We want two white porridge and inform 10 yuan a small bowl.Yuan/piece, plus 15 % of service fees. In this way, two bowls of white porridge and six pieces of bread a total of 37 yuan. My mother and I started to nostly miss the Taiping Hiroshima at 10 yuan for the Taiping Kok of Two days before.After ordering the meal, because there is a meal delivery service, we will go back to the room to rest first. As a result, there are no waiters to come and wait for the left and right. My poor mother pulls and vomits.You have to eat breakfast pads before.Later, my mother couldn't help it. I urged me to call the restaurant. I rolled through the room to explain that I did not find the restaurant phone. My mother had to go downstairs to urge himself. As a result, the porridge was still boiled.EssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceAfter waiting for a long time, we finally brought hot white porridge and bread. We were excited and finally eaten.Later, we told the situation with the waiter. He said that we should go to the hospital in your physical condition. He has to tell the hotel leader. We are very moved. To be honest, the waiter is the most enthusiastic after arriving at the hotel.We check out, none of them.EssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceThe room fee of 618 yuan, but the service did not reach this price. We felt that the house fee of 209 yuan we had stayed in the past felt that the star service was enjoyed.The inner smile and sincere service are what our guests care about most."
1,离剑池、芦花荡、旭光台近，房间干净整洁，管理的不错，床有点软，下次还来。补充点评2008年8月7日：路边也可停车，走下台阶即到酒店。二楼四间房，一间行政房双阳台大床，三间豪房，其中一间有阳台；三楼两间标房。莫干山山蚊极其凶猛，建议穿防蚊衣裤。上山可走前山，高等级公路，安全但绕远，下山可走后山，山路陡窄，但很近。,"Near Jianchi, Luhua Dang, Xuguangtai, the room is clean and tidy, the management is good, and the bed is a bit soft. I will come next time.Supplementary comment on August 7, 2008: You can also park on the roadside, and go to the hotel when you walk down the steps.There are four rooms on the second floor, a dual balcony bed in an administrative room, and three luxury houses, one of which has a balcony; the third floor and two benchmarks.Mogan Mountain mosquito is extremely fierce, and it is recommended to wear anti -mosquito clothes.Go up the mountain, you can walk in the mountains, high -level highways, safe but far away, you can walk down the mountain, the mountain road is relatively narrow, but it is very close."
1,"看了一些朋友的评价之前多少有些顾虑,但去了之后觉得还好啊。尽管住的是靠火车道一面,因为楼层高,又不开窗户和门,所以也没听到什么特别吵的声音.而且前台服务态度也还不错.之前告诉阳面只有2-3层,高层的在火车道一面,于是才选的.个人感觉398的价格还算值得.各方面也都不错啦~值得推荐~","I read some friends from the evaluation of some friends, but I felt okay after I went.Although it is on the side of the train road, because the floor is high and the windows and doors are not open, so I did not hear any particularly noisy sounds. And the front desk service attitude is not bad. I told Yang Noodles that there are only 2-3 floors, high-rise ones, and high-rise ones.On the side of the train, I chose it. I feel that the price of 398 is worth it. It is also good in all aspects ~ It is worth recommending ~"
1,朋友对该酒店的评价比较满意，就是交通非常拥堵。每次进出都要花费很长的时间。,"A friend's evaluation of the hotel is relatively satisfied, that is, traffic is very congested.It takes a long time to enter and exit each time."
0,其实就是原来的招待所，重新装修了一下。倒是比较干净，服务也还可以，设施不是很好，最重要的是那个院子晚上12点要关大门的，结果有一天晚上回来晚了，怎么敲门也没人搭理，后来有个保安出来说走后面的门，真是郁闷啊！,"In fact, it was the original guest house, renovated again.It is relatively clean and the service is okay. The facilities are not very good. The most important thing is that the yard should be closed at 12 o'clock in the evening. As a result, one night is late.It's really depressed to walk behind the door!"
1,"比较经济,早餐还可以,就是离市区有点距离.","Compared with economical, breakfast is okay, it is a bit away from the urban area."
1,房间条件不错，设施齐全。208的价钱合理。不足之处是隔音不好，能听到外面的车辆嘈杂声。如包早餐更好~~呵呵补充点评2007年12月14日：最不好的就是八楼的娱乐场所~~~进出人员复杂,"The room has good conditions and complete facilities.The price of 208 is reasonable.The disadvantage is that the sound insulation is not good, and you can hear the noise of the vehicle outside.It ’s better for breakfast for breakfast ~~ Hehe to add review December 14, 2007: The worst is the entertainment venue on the eighth floor ~~~ The entry and exit are complicated"
0,很旧的酒店，前台服务员没笑脸，门口没有行李员，房间里各处都有污渍，天花板竟然还有一块没有盖好的，露出上面的管道，淋浴龙头非常不舒服。介绍上说房间有冰箱，结果两间房都没有，因为有药需要冷藏打电话给客房服务问能不能帮我冰下，竟然反问我房间没有冰箱吗？得知没有后开始说帮我拿个冰箱上来，等了很久都没有，再次打电话后帮我拿了一包冰块上来。早餐是我这次旅行中最差的一次。,"The old hotel, the front desk waiter did not smile, there was no luggage at the door, there were stains in the rooms, and the ceiling had a piece that was not covered.Introduce the room in the room. As a result, there were no rooms in the two rooms, because there were medicines that needed refrigerator to call the room service to ask if I could help me under the ice, and asked me if there was no refrigerator in my room?After I learned that I didn't start to help me get a refrigerator, I waited for a long time. After calling again, I helped me get a pack of ice cubes.Breakfast is the worst one in my trip."
1,"真的很差!如果再去上海宁愿多花些钱也不住这儿.房间位置很好可以看到两面景色但房间内设施不算太好,我这人喜欢观察细节(在此之间住了两个酒店对比起来没想到这个这么差劲!)浴室用具不好,拖鞋只有一双质量不好(感觉像是住进了没星的酒店),我们是晚上8点多才由昆山回到上海前台小姐服务态度不好(这个我要强调一下!)下楼","It's really bad! If you go to Shanghai to spend more money, you can't live here. The location of the room is very good. You can see the scenery on both sides, but the facilities in the room are not very good. I like to observe the details (live in between hereThe two hotels did not expect this to be so bad!) The bathroom utensils are not good, and the slippers have only one pair of bad quality (it feels like living in a hotel that has not been in the star).Poor attitude (I want to emphasize this!) Go downstairs"
0,不知前面几位朋友怎么评价的，反正我自己入住后感觉实在不好，CHACKIN,"I don't know how the previous friends evaluated, anyway, I feel bad after my own check -in. Chackin"
0,锦江贵宾楼房间装修还可以，环境一般，我认为本次入住餐饮服务比较差，比如我点菜时他告诉我68元，但结帐时时98元。而且价格比较高。,"Jinjiang VIP building is also okay. The environment is average. I think this time I have a poor catering service. For example, when I order meals, he told me 68 yuan, but at the checkout of 98 yuan.And the price is relatively high."
1,非常值得推荐的酒店，我们是除夕夜在酒店过的，房间很大，挺舒服的，晚上景色超美，整个180度的视野范围内都可以看到烟花。服务好，早餐也还不错，停车场很大很方便。唯一遗憾的是卫生间感觉有一点儿小，五星酒店应该再阔气一些，但硬件设施还是挺高档的，洗漱用品配的也很全，牙膏都是高露洁的。,"It is worth recommending a hotel. We have been in the hotel New Year's Eve. The room is large and comfortable. The scenery at night is super beautiful. Fireworks can be seen throughout the perspective of 180 degrees.The service is good, the breakfast is not bad, and the parking lot is very convenient.The only regret is that the bathroom feels a little small. The five -star hotel should be more gas, but the hardware facilities are still very high -end. The toiletries are also equipped with complete, and the toothpaste is high."
0,晚上有很多按摩小姐打电话，很烦！告诉他们不要再打了还是照样打！前台无法用信用卡预授权，一定要现金交押金，而且还不然存放行李，搞得我拖着行李去银行取钱！（还好银行近，要不...）,"There are a lot of massage ladies in the evening, which is annoying!Tell them not to fight anymore!The front desk cannot be pre -authorized with a credit card. Be sure to pay the deposit in cash, or it still stores luggage, so that I drag my luggage to the bank to withdraw money!(Fortunately, the bank is close, otherwise ...)"
1,晕菜，写了那么多怎么没提交上？彻底晕菜不重复写了，总之很好，希望大家都能去住如果老板娘能看到留言就好了，我们是初四晚上，也就是21号入住的一家三口，带一个5岁小女孩的一家子啦。,"Halo vegetables, why didn't you submit so much?It is not repeatedly written in the faint vegetables. In short, I hope everyone can live. If the boss can see the message, we are the fourth night, that is, a family of three staying on the 21st, bring a 5 -year -old girl.The family is."
1,不好的地方就是我们搞不明白这么差的兴安县城怎么会有那么好的酒店，呵呵，乐满地我们没有去游，可能是因为那里吧,"The bad thing is that we can't understand how such a bad hotel has such a good hotel. Hehe, we didn't travel to the whole place, maybe because of it, right?"
1,房间比较小，打车不是很方便。还有早饭种类比较少,"The room is relatively small, and it is not very convenient to take a taxi.There are also fewer breakfast types"
1,"去的时候,酒店大厅和餐厅在装修,感觉大厅有点挤.由于餐厅装修本来该享受的早饭,也没有享受(他们是8点开始每个房间送,但是我时间来不及了)不过前台服务员态度好!","When I went, the hotel lobby and restaurant were renovating, and I felt a bit crowded. Because the restaurant decoration had had breakfast that should have been enjoyed, I did not enjoy it (they were delivered at 8 o'clock at 8 o'clock, but I was too late)"""
1,朝阳的房间不算大，朝南的房间比较大，有大沙发，但是比较昏暗。大堂比较暗，不敞亮。位置比较靠中心，就是门口有单行。,"Chaoyang's room is not large, the room facing the south is relatively large, there are large sofas, but it is dim.The lobby is darker and not open.The position is more dependent on the center, that is, there is a single line at the door."
1,酒店不错，房间很干净，服务也很不错啊，下次还住这里啊,"The hotel is good, the room is very clean, and the service is very good. I still live here next time"
1,可以够4星。泳池屁股大点儿，水还不清。宽带慢如牛。早餐质量不高。,"It can be enough for 4 stars.The swimming pool buttocks are a little big, and the water is not clear.Broadband is slow as cow.The quality of breakfast is not high."
1,我住的是商务标，房间不错，很干净，服务也好！下回还会住。。。,"I live in the business standard. The room is good, clean, and service!I will live next time.EssenceEssence"
1,大堂很大气，服务也不错，早餐业还ok，在大同这样的城市算性价比不错的酒店了，下次还会入住，送的瓶装水，有一瓶感觉被人打开过，盖子下面那圈连着盖子一起被拧开了，是不是上一个客人发现这种情况，没喝，所以服务员只换了一瓶水。,"The lobby is very atmospheric and the service is also good. The breakfast industry is still OK. It is a good cost -effective hotel in cities like Datong. I will stay in the next time. The bottle water given is opened.The lid was unscrewed together. Did the last guest discover this situation and did not drink, so the waiter only changed a bottle of water."
1,2月份通过携程网在世代锦江商务酒店定了一间房，考虑的是要在附近办事方便。房间不错，干净舒适，服务也很及时周到。就是酒店大堂太小，还大部分都被店铺占据，周围也没有什么绿化。不过作为商务性酒店，图的是经济实惠，也就可以理解了，性价比还是不错的。,"In February, a house was set at the Jinjiang Business Hotel through Ctrip.com in February. It considers it to be convenient to work nearby.The room is good, clean and comfortable, and the service is very timely and thoughtful.It is that the hotel lobby is too small, and most of them are occupied by shops, and there are no greening around.However, as a business hotel, the picture is economically affordable, it can be understood, the cost -effective is still good."
0,不知道这个酒店是怎么混到的这么高的评分，名不副实啊。酒店很老了，设施陈旧，服务也一般，我订的大床房，先是给了给窗户完全被边上的一幢楼挡住了的房间，好在房间里有一个灯不亮，以此为理由要求换房，换得第二间房就在原来房间的上面一层，同样是暗无天日，同样是灯不亮，再换第三房间，这次总算窗外亮些了，可又上不了网，只好再换，最后第四个房间据说是升级到高级间了，其实就多了两个沙发。,"I don't know how this hotel has been mixed with such a high score. The name is not true.The hotel is very old, the facilities are old, and the service is average. The big bed room I booked first was given the room that was completely blocked by a building on the side. Fortunately, there was a lamp in the room.The reason is required to change the house. The second room is on the upper floor of the original room. It is also dark. It is also not bright. Then change the third room.I had to change it again. In the last fourth room, it was said that it was upgraded to a high -level room. In fact, there were two more sofas."
0,典型的垃圾酒店，和同档次的王府饭店和李汪大酒店差得很远，服务差，设施差，给我的感觉是酒店的服务生是上帝好像我签了他们钱似的，checkin的时候无缘无故态度极其恶劣更别说笑容了，建议不要住那里。,"The typical garbage hotel is far from the same -grade Wangfu Hotel and the Lee Wang Hotel. The service is poor and the facilities are poor. The feeling of the hotel is that God has signed them as if I signed them.There is a bad attitude for no reason, let alone a smile, it is recommended not to live there."
0,同样的价格相差一个月，房间小了一倍！忽悠，接着忽悠！,"The same price is one month, and the room is doubled!Fully, then flickering!"
1,"厦门司机都知道的酒店,还不错,卫生,房间,设施都可以,不过早饭一日不如一日~(我们住的那三天)~~","The hotels that Xiamen drivers know are not bad, hygiene, rooms, facilities are okay, but breakfast is not as good as one day ~ (three days we live in) ~~"
1,酒店有两种房间，一种是豪华型的，是主楼，一种是商务型的，在副楼，但事情别选择副楼，附楼有点像民宅的感觉，有不安全感，主楼还是不错的，符合四星级的标准，更值得一提的是距离京沪高速很近，非常方便。,"There are two types of rooms in the hotel, one is luxurious, the main building, the other is a business type, in the auxiliary building, but do n’t choose a deputy building. The attached building is a bit like a house.The four -star standards are worth mentioning that it is very close to the Beijing -Shanghai high speed and very convenient."
1,"房间内设施还不错,不过浴室的淋浴喷头不好用,水量不可调节,出水较散,有些不象四星级的标准.周边环境尤其是酒店后边环境不太好,大堂也太小了吧.","The facilities in the room are not bad, but the shower head in the bathroom is not easy to use, the amount of water is not adjustable, and the water is scattered. Some are not like four -star standards. The surrounding environment, especially the hotel, is not very good, and the lobby is too small."

1,酒店位置比较隐秘，开车兜了新会一圈才找到。酒店环境非常好，房间设施也很新，大大超出预料，就是房间比较小，厕所很挤。下次去新会还会住这里。,"The location of the hotel was relatively hidden.The hotel environment is very good, the room facilities are also very new, which is greatly exceeded, that is, the room is relatively small and the toilet is crowded.Next time I go to Xinhui, I will live here."
1,定了高级湖景房，前台给了最高的23层。房间非常舒服，而且早餐也很丰盛。只是看出去的白鹭洲公园景色一般。可能住标准客房更实惠些。,"The high -end lake view room was set, and the front desk was given the highest 23 floors.The room is very comfortable and breakfast is rich.It is just that the scenery of the Egretzhou Park that looks like is average.It may be more affordable to live in standard rooms."
1,在秦皇岛这种小城市算了不错了，普标没有了，免费升级，所以感觉物超所值。位置不错，服务尚可；就是两个门童呆头呆脑的，不知道帮客人提行礼，甚至不知道点头问好，建议取消算了，增加费用还挡路。,"The small cities like Qinhuangdao are good, the general bid is gone, and it is upgraded for free, so it feels worthwhile.The location is good and the service is acceptable; that is, the two children are dumbfounded. I do n’t know how to help the guests to mention the gift, and I do n’t even know that nodding and asking hello. It is recommended to cancel the calculation and increase the cost."
1,"不错的选择,气派的大堂,干净的房间,卫生间也很大,玻璃墙.缺点是卫生间的装修有点旧了.地理位置也很好.对面就是青龙超市,补给很方便.在宜春,还是很推荐的.补充点评2007年5月5日：晚上也可以在酒店里吃饭,","Good choice, the lobby of the gas, the clean room, the bathroom is also very large, the glass wall.

0,酒店位置不是很理想，去金元购物中心还是蛮近的，大约10分钟车程，我入住的是448的房间，正赶上卫生部开会，人很多，另外，2个房间之间有一扇门，隔音效果特别不好，半夜时被隔壁的亲热声吵醒，晕,"The location of the hotel is not very ideal. It is still very close to the Jinyuan Shopping Center. About 10 minutes of drive. I stayed in the room of 448 and was catching up with the Ministry of Health to meet. There were many people. In addition, there was a door between the two rooms.The sound insulation effect is particularly not good. It was awakened by the intimate sound of the next door in the middle of the night."
0,一进房间就有一股霉味，后来发现马桶水箱出不了水，两次让服务员来修理，还是不太放心，而且对服务员的态度也感到不满，于是在前台要求更换另一楼层的房间，可是换过了的房间，可能很长时间无人住过，下水渠散出很浓的臭味，真让人不适，还好，这层的服务员还算很认真地用水冲洗了浴室，到了晚上我们洗澡后，又发现有水从床前的木地板夹逢渗透出来，相对这样收费却又如此的质量，真让我无话可说了。,"As soon as I entered the room, I had a moldy smell. Later, I found that the toilet water tank could not be released. Two times to let the waiter repair it, I was still unhappy, and I was dissatisfied with the attitude of the waiter.The room that has been changed may not live for a long time, and the launching canal has a strong smell. It is really uncomfortable. Fortunately, the waiters on this layer are still rinsed with the bathroom with water. At night, weAfter taking a bath, I found that there was a water from the wooden floor in front of the bed and penetrated out. The quality of the charges was so much that made me have nothing to say."
0,"我是在晚上12点到达兰州市火车站,下火车后问了３个路人也不知道有该酒店,最后我们选择打车去,因离火车站比较远打车要１１元,建议如果是到兰州作为中转站的朋友最好选择其他酒店.可能因为是晚上加上该酒店的大堂比较偏僻的原因,就算车子停在酒店的门口我们也花了５分钟才找到大门的入口．登记的时候服务小姐竟然问了一句＂我们这里有早餐的请问你需不需要＂我问她房间不是含早餐的吗，她的回答说是，我当时心里面就感到特奇怪她为什么要问我要不要早餐呢？在１２点３０分我们进到了房间，当时发现天气很冷而且找遍整个房间也只有两张被子，因此给前台打了个电话说多要一张被子，可能因为太晚了当时前台的小姐开始说没有，我说太冷了麻烦她帮忙问一下，她说可以帮我问一下但是没有的话她也无能为力，我当时的感觉是这间酒店的服务也太勉强了．结果到最后她的回复当然也是没有了，我也不想跟她再多说什么，到了第二天一早８点多就到了２楼吃了我生平看过最没有东西吃的早餐就快快退房了．我们本次旅游前后１２天都是通过携程订的房间，入住的地方有宁夏－甘肃－青海，总的来说我对这一间酒店各方面的感觉最差．完全感受不到服务而且还要受气．补充点评2007年10月9日：我认为３３０元的价格订位是完全不合理的．","I arrived at the Lanzhou Railway Station at 12 pm. After getting off the train, I asked 3 passers -by and did not know that there was the hotel. Finally, we chose to take a taxi. Because it is more than 11 yuan to take a taxi from the train station.Friends at the transfer station are best to choose other hotels. It may be because it is more remote at night with the lobby of the hotel. Even if the car stops at the door of the hotel, we also spend 5 minutes to find the entrance of the door.When I registered, the service lady asked, ""We have breakfast here, do you need to ask if I ask her room for breakfast? Her answer is that I felt strange in my heart why she asked me why she asked me.Do you want breakfast?At 12:30, we entered the room. At that time, we found that the weather was very cold and there were only two quilts to find the entire room. Therefore, I called the front desk and said that one more quilt was required.I said no, I said it was too cold, trouble, she could help ask, she said that she could help me ask but she could not do it. I felt that the service of this hotel was too reluctant.As a result, of course, her reply was gone, and I didn't want to say anything more with her. By 8 o'clock the next morning, I ate on the second floor..We were all ordered through Ctrip in 12 days before and after this tour. The place where we stayed in was Ningxia -Gansu -Qinghai. In general, I felt the worst in all aspects of this hotel.I can't feel the service at all and I have to get angry.Supplementary comment on October 9, 2007: I think the price of 330 yuan is completely unreasonable."
1,地理位置不错，因为威海小，所以打车到市区也不用很多钱。我订的是海景房，海景不能说很美，但有日出可以看。而且海边一个小小渔港到了下午4点多打渔的人归航了，别是一番风景。前台服务一般，很客气，但缺乏真诚，就是那种职业化的“不得不对顾客有礼貌”的感觉吧。HOUSEKEEPING人员的服务倒是很好。补充点评2007年9月28日：自助早餐还可以，就是有点苍蝇飞飞。也许我去的时候是淡季，九月初，只有三四个人吃早饭,"The geographical location is good, because Weihai is small, so you don't need a lot of money to take a taxi to the city.I booked a sea view room. The sea view cannot be said to be beautiful, but there is sunrise to see.Moreover, a small fishing port on the beach returned to the people who hit more than 4 pm. Don't be a scenery.The front desk service is general, very polite, but lack of sincerity, it is the kind of professionalism ""to be polite to customers"".The service of the Housekeeping personnel is very good.Supplementary comment on September 28, 2007: Buffet breakfast is okay, but a bit of flies flying.Maybe when I go, it is off -season. In early September, only three or four people had breakfast"
1,"晚上到的深圳机场，打的到酒店半个小时左右，120块的样子.酒店CHECKIN还算快.但是很奇怪,晚上睡觉的时候总有""的,的,的""的声音,是从窗户那里传来的,仔细检查了下，发现窗户是关的好好的,哪里来的声音也不知道.酒店的洗澡水很大很足,就算12点以后也还是那样,不错.就是CTRIP的预定有点问题，说提前7天预定可以拿到590的价格,我提前了10多天预定的，最后在出发前查了一下，就算提前一天也是同样的价格,感觉有点上当受骗的感觉,CTRIP现在也开始对客户耍手段了.我香港的是九龙万丽,幸亏我是自用万豪的网上预定,同样的行政楼层,CTRIP要比万豪贵100多HKD.看来，以后是要多多比较比较了,CTRIP也不一定会是我的首选.","The Shenzhen Airport at night, the hotel is about half an hour, 120 yuan. The hotel checkin is quite fast.When it came, I checked it carefully and found that the window was closed well, and the sound came from.

I have a book preparation for more than 10 days in advance. Finally, I checked it before the departure. Even one day in advance is the same price.The customer is playing. My Hong Kong is Kowloon Wanli. Fortunately, I am a online booking of Marriott. The same administrative floor, CTRIP is more than 100 HKD than Wanhao.It will definitely be my first choice."
1,房间环境都是很不错的。有几个问题还有待改进。1早餐比较单调2停车不方便，而且每次进出都要刷个卡，比较麻烦,"The room environment is very good.There are several problems to be improved.1 Breakfast is relatively monotonous 2 is not convenient to park, and you need to swipe a card every time you enter and exit, it is more troublesome"
1,一家欧式风格的酒店，大堂气派，房间也不错，还有水果、咖啡送。“美林阁”餐厅在上海挺有名气，特地去品尝了一下，的确不错，凭房卡还可以打8.8折。一楼大堂西侧有一个酒吧，晚上和几个朋友一起小坐了一会儿，里面环境不错，东西也不贵，同样凭房卡还可以打8.8折。下次还会入住这家酒店，有兴趣的朋友不妨也去试试。,"A European -style hotel, the lobby style, the room is also good, as well as fruits and coffee.The ""Meilin Pavilion"" restaurant is very famous in Shanghai. I went to taste it. It is really good. It can also be 8.8 % off with the house card.There is a bar on the west side of the lobby on the first floor. At night, I sat with a few friends for a while. The environment is good and the things are not expensive. It can also be 8.8 % off with a house card.I will stay in this hotel next time, and friends who are interested may wish to try it."
1,酒店不错，就是游泳池稍微小了点，离九寨沟沟口有1.5km，目前淡季，交通不方便，只能包车去景点，但是机票房价很实惠，九寨沟的风景不错的哦，周围晚上出去的时候没有安全感。,"The hotel is good, that is, the swimming pool is slightly smaller, there is 1.5km from the mouth of Jiuzhaigougou. At present, the off -season is inconvenient. You can only charter the car to the attractions.sense of security."
1,服务态度比较好，愿意听取客户所提出意见，290元的房间设施还可以，房间空间稍微小了些，早餐比较一般，按道理4星级应该会好些，别的4星级也住过，,The service attitude is better. I am willing to listen to the opinions of the customers. The room facilities of 290 yuan are okay. The room space is slightly smaller. The breakfast is relatively average. The 4 -star level should be better according to the reason.
0,酒店服务还可以，就是设施有点旧了，抽水马桶坏了（应该是自动上水装置出现问题），每次冲过水后，水还是不断的流，为了节约用水（水很宝贵，不能浪费），我就把马桶后面的水阀关掉。本来准备住两天，可是看酒店的设施太差，住了一天就去义乌了，在义乌住两天。这家酒店价位比义乌的假日之星连锁酒店贵，但是设施还没有假日之星的设施好。,"The hotel service is okay, that is, the facilities are a bit old, and the water pumping toilet is broken (it should be a problem with the automatic water device). After each rushing through the water, the water continues to flow.I turned off the water valve behind the toilet.I was ready to live for two days, but I saw that the hotel's facilities were too bad. I went to Yiwu for a day and lived in Yiwu for two days.The price of this hotel is more expensive than the Holiday Star Chain in Yiwu, but the facilities are not as good as the facility of the Holiday Star."
1,很不错的酒店，我住的是商务间，上网速度非常快，下载达到2M/s，非常爽！还在酒店碰到老朋友...世界真是小！,"Very good hotel, I live in business rooms, the Internet speed is very fast, downloaded to 2m/s, very cool!I still met my old friend in the hotel ... the world is really small!"
0,"我们住的是13楼,不过因为是延马路,所以到了晚上还是有很吵的声音,隔音不太好,房间内的设施很旧,有可能是年代久远的缘故,都不及如家,莫泰168....性价比很差另外还有","We live in the 13th floor, but because it is Yanma Road, there is still a very noisy voice at night. The sound insulation is not very good. The facilities in the room are very old. It may be because of the age.... the price is very poor and there are other"
1,其实这个价格相对这个状况的酒店已经不便宜了（360元），这个季节，这个城市乱七八糟的。但是相对这个（4星）级别的，已经算是还可以了,"In fact, the hotel with this price is not cheap (360 yuan). This season, the city is messy.But compared to this (4 -star) level, it is okay"
0,设施太陈旧了，位置离火车站近，但附近差不多条件却价格更便宜的酒店多得很！我住九层，晚上睡觉的环境都不好，比较吵，糟杂，我房间对面及左右的房间门都不关，玩通宵牌的，人多嘴杂（也没有酒店工作人员制止）！这酒店真的不太好！,"The facilities are too old, and the location is close to the railway station, but there are more cheap hotels nearby but cheaper nearby!I live in the nine floors. The environment of sleeping at night is not good. It is more noisy and mixed. The door of the room opposite and the left and right rooms is not closed.This hotel is really not very good!"
1,在浦东地区的4星里面，性价比比较高，适合自费的商住人士。房间虽然较小，但床够大，睡眠较舒适。一般单人间性价比最高。,"Among the 4 stars in the Pudong area, the cost performance is relatively high, suitable for commercial and residential people at their own expense.Although the room is small, the bed is large enough, and the sleep is more comfortable.Generally, the highest cost -effective single person."
1,行政豪华间有点偏贵，房间面积小了！服务总体还可以，就是房间清扫人员不太注意礼貌，有时候刚敲门马上就擅自进来！酒店位置不错！,"The administrative luxury room is a bit expensive, and the room area is small!The service is generally okay, that is, the cleaning staff of the room does not pay much attention to politeness, and sometimes they come in immediately after knocking on the door!The hotel location is good!"
1,"说说我感觉出来的不足:1,房间陈设过于简单,房间感觉有点""空""(网上注明的190的“标间”其实是两个床的房间，也许是我一个人住，感觉太空？）2,但是色调偏暗,给人的感觉就有些""老""；3,房间的卫浴搞得不是很好,有些像""老旧""的澡堂一样的淋浴……不过,其他都还可以,该有的都有~基本上还是满意了.","Talking about the lack of feeling: 1. The room is too simple, and the room feels a bit ""empty"" (the ""standard room"" indicated on the Internet is actually a room of two beds. Maybe I live alone and feel space?) 2, but the color tone is darker, it feels a bit ""old""; 3, the bathrooms in the room are not very good, some shower like ""old"" bathhouse ... but everything else is okay, it should be, it should be, it's timeSome are all ~ basically satisfied."
1,"一直帮国外同事定的酒店,非常好的环境和房间",The hotel that has been settled by foreign colleagues has been a very good environment and room
0,"非常不好的经历,通过携程定的房间,到了以后,服务的人员居然要我的身份证,我在美国生活了10年,早就没有了身份证,还好护照也勉强接受了,整个服","Very bad experience, through Ctrip's room, in the future, the service personnel actually asked my ID card. I have lived in the United States for 10 years, and I have no ID card. Fortunately, the passport is barely accepted."
1,订的标准间，但免费升级为行政间，不错。酒店环境不错，服务也很好。但酒店门口的停车场竟然要收费，感觉很不好，第一次碰到这种状况，希望下次去，住店的客人能够免费，不是因为20元的原因，是因为你们是五星级酒店，自然应该有真正五星级的服务。,"The standard room, but it is free to upgrade to the administrative room, which is good.The hotel environment is good and the service is good.However, the parking lot at the entrance of the hotel has to charge it. It feels very bad. For the first time, I encountered this situation. I hope that next time, the guests who live in the store can be free. It is not because you are 20 yuan, because you are a five -star level.Hotels should naturally have a real five -star service."
1,"这个饭店的位置非常好,我来出差办事,无论是去行政机关,还是去客户公司都很方便.员工的服务态度也很好,效率很高.我认为这个饭店很新,可它仍在不断的装修完善,足可见饭店的重视和集团的雄厚实力.","The location of this restaurant is very good. I come to work on a business trip. It is very convenient to go to the administrative organs or go to the customer company. The employee's service attitude is also very good and the efficiency is very high.The decoration is complete, which can be seen in the hotel's attention and the strong strength of the group."
1,"环境5星,自然氧吧名不虚传;服务4星,特别是开电平车的小伙子,总是露出自然的笑容,餐厅服务也不错,就是上菜慢了点.菜的味道不错,虽然有点贵(特色红烧肉西兰花打底:48,羊肉窜8窜薯条打底:24,毛血旺:28.早餐按照15元的标准,也过得去了.但没有西餐品钟,看到一老外围着转了一圈盘子里还空空的.哈哈,有待改进.本来想给个5分,但房间里的洗涑用品是个败笔,牙膏是那种家庭旅馆才用的那种中华牌,就是刷了没有泡只有渣的那种,建议自带牙具.","The environment is 5 stars, the natural oxygen bar is famous; the service of 4 stars, especially the young man who drives the electric vehicle, always shows a natural smile. The restaurant service is also good, but the food is slower.Braised meat Zealand Blossom: 48, Lamb Run 8 French French fries: 24, Mao Blood Want: 28. Breakfast is based on the standard of 15 yuan, but there is no western food clock.It was still empty in the plate. Haha, it has to be improved. I wanted to give 5 points, but the washing supplies in the room were defeated. Toothpaste was the kind of Chinese brand used by that kind of family hotel.There is only the kind of scum, it is recommended to bring your own tooth."
1,室外游泳池没有很好保养，黑黑的，反而刹风景。,"The outdoor swimming pool is not well maintained, black, but the scenery."
0,本想定晋祠宾馆，没房了，携城推荐到这儿，其实离晋祠还很远。服务态度不大好。根本就没有出租车，有黑车，斩得厉害。,"I wanted to Dingjin Temple Hotel, there was no house, and I recommended it here. In fact, it was far from the Jin Temple.The service attitude is not good.There is no taxi at all, there are black cars, and they are so powerful."
1,"总体来说,感觉尚可.订的是大床房,房间挺大,基本该有的都有了.能达到3.5星的水平,只是前台的服务不太好.好像是在打发人一样.冷冰冰......最不好的就是酒店附近比较荒凉补充点评2007年7月1日：最关键的是竟然不能上网,我问了前台服务员可以上网吗?一个服务员很不耐烦的摆摆手说没有可以上网的房间了.....无奈只好将就","Overall, it feels good. The big bed room is made, the room is quite large, and basically there should be. It can reach the level of 3.5 stars, but the service on the front desk is not very good. It seems to be sending people.... The worst is the more desolate and replenishment of the hotel near the hotel. On July 1, 2007: The most important thing is that it cannot surf the Internet. Can I ask the front desk waiters to surf the Internet?There is no room that can access the Internet ....."
0,一般////////////////////////,generally////////////////////////
1,环境非常好，服务非常好，交通不方便，价格有点贵,"The environment is very good, the service is very good, the transportation is not convenient, and the price is a bit expensive"
1,酒店临街，但还是建议住临街的房间，因为酒店后面有中央空调，噪音也不小，威海到了晚上11点之前基本马路上车就不多了，所以临街的房间反而要安静点。服务不错，很热情。酒店位置也还好，就在市中心。今后去威海可以考虑再住。,"The hotel is near the street, but it is still recommended to live in the street. Because there is a central air conditioner behind the hotel, the noise is not small. Weihai will not have much car on the road before 11 pm, so the room in the street is quiet.The service is good and very enthusiastic.The hotel location is also good, just in the city center.In the future, you can consider living again."
1,"入住的是豪华单人房,需要说明的是这个房间真的很小，这个价格和房间的大小是在不和谐，酒店硬件尚可，虽然在路边，但是晚上休息并不觉得吵闹，房间的隔音基本满意，酒店内部的餐厅我的评价是很差，菜烧的非常难吃，价格还贵，除非大家图方便，否则不推荐在那里就餐。整体感觉中规中矩，离皇岗（福田）口岸还比较近，如果要从这个口岸出关应该还比较方便。","It is a luxurious single room. What needs to be explained is that this room is really small. The price and the size of the room are not harmonious. The hotel's hardware is acceptable. Although the roadside is on the side of the road, the rest is not noisy at night. The room does not feel noisy.The sound insulation is basically satisfactory. My evaluation of the restaurant inside the hotel is very poor. The vegetables are very unpalatable and the price is expensive. Unless everyone is convenient, it is not recommended to eat there.The overall feeling is quite satisfactory, and it is still closer to the port of Huanggang (Futian). It should be more convenient to get out of this port."
1,在都会海逸住了4天，还不错。下次来应该还会考虑吧。去尖沙嘴的酒店巴士还算方便，酒店附近吃饭超级方便。,"It was pretty good for 4 days in Metropolitan Haiyi.I should consider it next time.It is convenient to go to the hotel bus in Tsimosui, and eating near the hotel is super convenient."
0,房间还可以，不脏；热水放了30分钟后才有点热，洗的不爽；早餐就凑合者吃吧，有就不错了；补充点评2008年3月21日：还不可以刷卡,"The room is OK, not dirty; it is a bit hot after 30 minutes of hot water, and it is uncomfortable to wash; the breakfast is made, it is good to have it;"
0,一个月前入住过，首先是装修已经很陈旧了，给人一种死气沉沉的感觉，再就是服务，都是大妈级的，倒退10年还能算4星，现在很难说了。,"I stayed in a month ago. The first was that the decoration was already very old, giving a feeling of deadness, and then the service. It was aunt -level. It can be counted as 4 stars for 10 years. It is difficult to say now."
1,我因为要到东大名路办事，这个位置不错，老牌的酒店，装修我也很满意，上海酒店，性价比很高了，如果提供早饭（其实没多少钱）就更好了,"Because I want to go to Dongda famous road, this position is good. I am also very satisfied with the old -fashioned hotel. Shanghai Hotel is very cost -effective."
1,我是4号和5号住在该酒店的标准海景蜜月房，4楼，感觉很方便，门口就是椰梦长廊，海月广场，打车5园到第一市场和春园，门口就有机场巴士。二楼有个小的游泳池，可以直接看到海月广场和椰梦长廊。晚上广场上还有很多活动，有孔明灯，还有跳舞的。性价比很高，酒店房间还不错，我住的是标准海景蜜月房，有阳台，只是前台服务不算好，老是推荐你去一些景点，我后三天住的是亚龙湾的金棕榈，和金棕榈比起来，服务不是一个档次。但是你可以不和他多话。哈哈。。。下次去还会考虑金凤凰，主要是方便，房间里面还是不错的，就是没早餐。,"I am the standard sea -view honeymoon room where I live in the hotel No. 4 and 5. I feel very convenient. The door is the Coconut Dream Corridor.Bus.There is a small swimming pool on the second floor, you can directly see Haiyue Plaza and Coconut Dream Gallery.There are many activities on the square in the evening, there are Kong Ming lanterns, and dancing.The price is very high. The hotel room is not bad. I live in the standard sea view honeymoon room with a balcony, but the front desk service is not good. I always recommend you to go to some attractions.Compared with palm, service is not a grade.But you can not talk much to him.Ha ha.EssenceEssenceThe next time I go, I will consider the golden phoenix. It is mainly convenient. The room is still good, but there is no breakfast."
1,"这个宾馆服务很不怎么样?当然,如果谈到房间内部肯定非常好,比HYYYAT,喜来登...,都要好.但是问题就在这个服务上(除了二楼意大利餐厅热情的迎宾女孩子),其他人不冷不热的,还有一进门的接待设置简直""自以为聪明"",以为在门口可以提前找预定,事实在笔记本上找非常浪费时间也不效率,我们就在门口站着等她找了3-5分钟,不得不到前台.....这个门口""笔记本""接待简直就是胡闹!酒吧很没有意思!其实整个酒店的地理位置也不怎么样.....最后我们一行人换到了金茂君悦住,感觉好多了,再也不住外滩WESTIN了.","This hotel's service is not good? Of course, if it comes to the room in the room, it must be very good, better than Hyyyat, Xilain ... it is better. But the problem is on this service (except for the enthusiastic welcome girl on the second floor Italian restaurant)Other people are not cold or hot, and the reception setting of the door of the door is simply ""self -consciousness"", thinking that you can find reservations in advance at the door. In fact, finding a very waste of time in the notebook is not efficient.After looking for 3-5 minutes, I have to go to the front desk ..... ""Notebook"" at this door is just a noise! The bar is very boring! In factAfter changing to Jin Mao Junyue, I felt much better, and I couldn't help the Bund Westin anymore."
1,不错，下次还考虑入住。交通也方便，在餐厅吃的也不错。,"Yes, I will consider staying next time.Transportation is also convenient and eats well in the restaurant."
1,"位置好,不错,挺干净舒服,价格也合适,去西安旅游推荐","The location is good, good, very clean and comfortable, and the price is also suitable."
1,总体不错！原来定298元的房间，因凌晨才到，免费升级到15楼的豪华房，还可以看到海景，三天都没有给我换房（周四到周日），值！房间设施还可以，达到3星标准吧，但洗脸盆水龙头漏水。16层是餐厅，我房间正好在餐厅下面，有一天他们员工聚会嘈了一下午！楼上的餐厅好象不对外？楼下怡情楼据说是青岛很出名的餐厅，挺火的，味道还行，价格跟啤酒街的差不多。步行向下200米有个大商场，购物吃饭很方便。可以住！,"Overall!It turned out that the room of 298 yuan was only arrived in the early morning, and it was upgraded to the luxury room on the 15th floor for free. You can also see the sea view. I did not change the room for three days (Thursday to Sunday), worth it!The room facilities are okay, to meet the 3 -star standard, but the faucet of the washbasin is leaking.The 16th floor is a restaurant. My room is just under the restaurant. One day, their employees gathering no afternoon!The restaurant upstairs does not seem to be out?The downstairs Yichenlou is said to be a well -known restaurant in Qingdao. It is quite hot and the taste is okay. The price is similar to the beer street.There is a large shopping mall in 200 meters walking down, and it is convenient to eat and eat.You can live!"
1,新的风格还是蛮精致的，掩盖了房间狭小的天生不足，但是有些细节尚不周到，比如那个烧水的电壶，塑料味道很重，恐怕是不合格产品.,"The new style is still quite exquisite, covering the narrow and natural deficiency of the room, but some details are not thoughtful. For example, the water -burned electric pot, the plastic taste is very heavy, I am afraid it is an unqualified product."
1,总的来说很不错。。。。。。。。。。。。。。,"Generally speaking, it is very good.EssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssence"
1,锦江富园酒店的网速实在是太慢了！比拨号还慢。电视很差，屏幕闪的厉害。HBO频道很不清楚，CRT的，现在改换液晶的了,"The network speed of Jinjiang Fuyuan Hotel is too slow!Slowly than dialing.The TV is very poor and the screen is flickering.HBO Channel is unclear, CRT’s, now changing LCD"
1,"环境不错非常的安静,房间也OK就是交通不方便!","The environment is good, very quiet, and the room is OK is inconvenient!"
1,很不错的酒店，当地最好的，豪华房可在24层办理入住,"Very good hotel, the best local, luxury rooms can be checked on on the 24th floor"
0,优点就是地理位置，到外滩和南京路走路10分钟。房间比较小，楼层举架低，有点压抑。卫生间毛巾也许消过毒，但很旧，颜色发黄，没办法，我用的自带毛巾。服务人员都不太热情，办理入住的女孩子们还好，大堂前的服务生，问个路什么的回答问题时基本不正眼看我，很锻炼我的脾气，有利于修身养性。,"The advantage is the geographical location, walking on the Bund and Nanjing Road for 10 minutes.The room is relatively small, the floor is low, and a bit depressed.The bathroom towels may be disinfected, but it is very old. The color is yellow. There is no way. I use my own towels.The service staff are not too enthusiastic. The girls who are going to check in are okay. The waiter in front of the lobby, asking about the question about the question, basically not to look at me, exercise my temper, and it is conducive to self -cultivation."
1,很不错的酒店，尽管在火车站，但很安静。房间干净，早餐一般。,"Very good hotel, although at the railway station, is quiet.The room is clean and breakfast is average."
1,早餐一般。其它还行。在富阳位置也算还行。,Breakfast is average.Others are OK.It is also okay in Fuyang's location.
0,是我到目前为止住过服务最差的五星级酒店，气温下降空调没热风，冻得直打哆嗦。按摩小姐无孔不入不管男士客人是否与老婆同行，即使在电梯里也疯狂的推销要不要按摩。妈妈桑更是夸张竟在我们房间门口问我先生要不要按摩她是妈妈桑可以安排最漂亮的小姐。有问题找值班经理，值班经理根本不予理会。不知道这个酒店是怎么评价成五星级的。,"I have lived in the worst -service five -star hotel so far. The temperature drops the air conditioner without hot air, and it is frozen and snoring.Missing Miss Missing Whether to enter the men's guests or not with his wife, even in the elevator, whether it is crazy about whether to massage.Mom Sang was exaggerated in front of the door of our room and asked my husband if she was massaged.If you have any questions about the manager of the duty class, the manager on duty is at all.I don't know how this hotel is evaluated as a five -star."
0,我和MM14日入住的此酒店，第一眼感觉还行，checkin后发现房间极小，隔音效果极差，大白天走道的声音都特大，唉！郁闷啊。第二天我们下午回酒店时发现房间还没有打扫，问了服务员说是酒店要求他们先打扫退房的房间，人手不够所以就没有来得及打扫，酒店的管理和人员配备应该加强！！此酒店带来很多不便，下次不会再考虑入住,"The hotel where I entered MM14 felt that it was okay at first glance. After checkin, I found that the room was very small, the sound insulation effect was very poor, and the sound of the walkway during the day was very large, oh!Depressed.The next day we returned to the hotel in the afternoon and found that the room had not been cleaned. The waiter said that the hotel asked them to clean up the room for the first time. If the people were not enough, they did not have time to clean it. The hotel management and personnel equipment should be strengthened!IntersectionThis hotel brings a lot of inconvenience, and will not consider check -in again next time"
0,饭店前台和预订部缺少起码的沟通，信息传递很满，而且前台态度很不好，电话声音很小，不热情,"The front desk of the hotel and the reservation department lack the minimum communication. The information is full, and the front desk attitude is very bad. The phone sound is very small, not enthusiastic"
1,房间还不错。床很舒服。但交通就不是非常好了。大堂容易把人走晕。很满意，下次还住。,"The room is not bad.The bed is very comfortable.But traffic is not very good.The lobby is easy to dizzy.I am very satisfied, I will live next time."
1,看过以前的点评，预订之前很犹豫。但因为是五一其他的选择不多，还是订了上客堂。住进去后觉得很不错。服务员穿着藏服，态度很热情。房间是四合院的形式，里面很干净，非常安静。好多年前住过绮望楼，觉得房间设施比那儿好（不过说不定绮望楼现在已重新装修过--但房价已贵得惊人）。上客堂唯一不足的是早餐很一般。总的来说性价比不错。,"After watching the previous reviews, he hesitated before booking.But because there are not many other options for May 1st, I ordered the visit to the guest hall.I feel very good after living in.The waiter was wearing a hidden suit and was very enthusiastic.The room is in the form of the courtyard, which is very clean and very quiet.I have lived in Qiwanglou many years ago, and I feel that the room facilities are better than there (but maybe Qiwanglou has renovated now-but house prices have been surprisingly expensive).The only disadvantage of going to the guest hall is that breakfast is very average.Overall the cost -effective."
1,第一次从网上订房确实很迷茫，不知道住哪家比较好，通过看携程的介绍加其他住过的客人评价，最后还是选择了离火车站最近的城市青年酒店，事实证明我的选择时正确的。总体来说我对本次的旅程非常满意，酒店整体设施比较完备，环境较好，最主要是方便快捷，如果说下次旅行选择订酒店，我还会选择城市青年。,"The first time I reorganized from the Internet is really confused. I do n’t know which one is better. By watching the introduction of Ctrip and the evaluation of other guests who lived, I finally chose the city youth hotel closest to the train station.correct.Generally speaking, I am very satisfied with this journey. The overall facilities of the hotel are relatively complete and the environment is good. The main is convenient and fast. If you choose a hotel for the next time, I will also choose urban youth."
1,去太原过周末特地订的晋祠宾馆。简直太美了！想我比较火星吧，第一次住国宾馆，第一次住有花园、小桥长廊流水的宾馆，喜欢地不得了。虽然去的时候是三月中旬，天气还比较凉，所有高大的树木都是被绿色的袋子包裹着（应该是为了冬天防霜冻吧），草地还是黄黄的，没有满目的绿色，但是就那个规模，每幢楼的特色看着都觉得很过瘾。一个周末哪也没去，就在晋祠闲逛了。可能不是旅游旺季的关系，当时似乎只有九号楼＆5号楼开放。九号楼是最后造的新楼，最靠近门口，现代漂亮大气。让我意外的是九号楼的房门都不是门对门的，而是成U字型对着中间的内庭式花园。服务员领着我们从大堂通过一路的落地窗到的房间，白色的纱幔若有似无地遮挡着三月和煦的午后阳光感觉很温馨。房间很宽敞，楼层很高，卫生间有淋浴房和浴缸。房间的落地窗对着外面的花园，风景也很好，只是可惜了树都穿着“衣服”，没有风景可以看。虽然不是旅游旺季，但是因为去的周末，有几家公司在晋祠宾馆开会（是国有银行拿着公款出来度假的说）。九号楼的房间只订到一天，第二天只好转到五号楼。五号楼从外表上看应该是最差的房间，也就是晋祠最便宜的房间价格，走到里面确实也是。先说大厅，其实没大厅的，除了九号楼都没大厅。地毯的颜色很深，走廊很长，光线很暗，感觉那个阴森～～～。房间除了层高比较高，其他实在是很差（和九号楼相比）。还算干净了，就是破旧简陋很多，床也很小很不舒服。这个装备在外面只能算三星以下吧。所以说，虽然是五星的国宾馆，房间的设施也是良莠不齐。在晋祠的两天，每天吃饱饭就在花园里逛，看到了拍《李大钊》的剧组。六号楼有一天是开着的，但是我们走到门口就有服务员问我们干嘛的，蛮客气的，我们也不好进去了。还有一号楼似乎是给国家领导住的，不对外开放。除了五号楼外，其他的楼从外面看都是两三层的样子，房间应该都不错的，但似乎也不想九号楼那么大气。有一幢楼，似乎是四号楼是会所，有游泳池，还有室外的运动场地。宾馆最深处是驻军部队，经常看到绿色兵GG在路上走过。提醒一下，周末去晋祠一定要早订，我提前了一周订房，因为房间满了不得不换了两次房间，第二天还不得不去住最差的五号楼。即便不是旅游旺季，周末似乎房源比较紧张，而似乎晋祠也不会把每个楼都对外开放。服务员态度很好，每一个都很好。餐厅晚上有自助餐，虽然东西不多，味道还可以，70元/位（不太记得了，应该是这个价格）。我推荐自助餐，如果点餐的话点不了几个也就这点钱了。另外，九号楼餐厅旁有个卖零食的小卖部，东西不多，价格和外面的居然一样，在酒店这样便宜的还真不多。,"Go to the Jin Temple Hotel, which is booked on the weekend.It's so beautiful!I think I compare Mars. For the first time I lived in the State Hotel, and the first time I lived in a hotel with gardens and small bridge promenade flowing water, I liked the land.Although it was in mid -March, the weather was cooler. All tall trees were wrapped in green bags (should be for winter anti -frost).In the scale, the characteristics of each building feel very enjoyable.I didn't go there for a weekend, just strolling around the Jin Temple.It may not be the relationship between the peak tourist season.Building 9 is the last new building, closest to the door, modern and beautiful.What surprised me was that the door of the No. 9 Building was not the door to the door, but the U -shaped garden facing the inner garden in the middle.The waiter led us to the room from the floor -to -ceiling windows from the lobby. The white veil seemed to cover the sun in the March and the sun in the afternoon of March.The room is very spacious, the floor is high, and the bathroom has a shower room and a bathtub.The floor -to -ceiling window of the room is facing the garden outside, and the scenery is also very good, but unfortunately, the trees are wearing ""clothes"". There is no scenery to see.Although it is not a peak tourist season, because of the weekend, several companies met at the Jin Temple Hotel (the state -owned bank came out of the vacation with public funds).The room of Building No. 9 was only booked for one day, and the next day had to be transferred to Building 5.From the outside, Building 5 should be the worst room, that is, the cheapest room price of the Jin Temple, which is indeed the same.Let's talk about the hall first. In fact, there are no halls. There is no hall except Building No. 9.The color of the carpet is very dark, the corridor is very long, and the light is dark, and it feels gloomy ~~~.In addition to the high floor height, the room is very poor (compared to Building 9).It's not clean, that is, it is much more dilapidated and humble, and the bed is very small and uncomfortable.This equipment can only be counted as Samsung.Therefore, although it is a five -star national hotel, the facilities in the room are also uneven.Two days in the Jin Temple, I went shopping in the garden every day, and saw the crew of ""Li Dazhao"".Building 6 was opened one day, but when we walked to the door, a waiter asked us what we did. It was very polite, and we were not easy to enter.There is also building No. 1 to live for the leadership of the country, and it is not open to the public.Except for Building 5, other buildings look like two or three floors from the outside. The room should be good, but it does not seem to want to be as atmospheric.There is a building, which seems to be the clubhouse No. 4, there are swimming pools, as well as outdoor sports venues.The deepest part of the hotel is the garrison forces, and the green soldier GG often walks on the road.Remind that I must book early to the Jinci Temple on the weekend. I reservations for a week in advance, because the room had to change the room twice, and I had to live in the worst Building 5 the next day.Even if it is not a peak tourist season, it seems that the housing is relatively tight on the weekend, and it seems that the Jin Temple will not open each building to the public.The waiter has a good attitude, and each one is very good.The restaurant has a buffet at night. Although there are not many things, the taste is okay, 70 yuan/person (I don't remember, it should be the price).I recommend a buffet. If you order a few, you ca n’t order a few.In addition, there is a small sales department selling snacks next to the restaurant of Building No. 9. There are not many things. The price is the same as the outside. There are not many cheap on the hotel."
1,1.大堂前台服务快捷，效率高。2.客房层和房间空气不好，通风不良。3.房间干净，但是陈设和配置过于简陋。4.三楼餐厅早餐品种尚可，服务欠培训，二星水准。5.二楼餐厅菜谱海鲜丰富，但是素菜类品种太少。感觉一般般喽，不如隔壁的金雁。,"1. The lobby front desk service is fast and efficient.2. The rooms and rooms are not good, and the ventilation is poor.3. The room is clean, but the furnishings and configurations are too rude.4. Breakfast varieties on the third floor are still available.5. The restaurant on the second floor is rich in seafood, but there are too few vegetarian dishes.It feels like it is not as good as the Jinyan next door."
1,如果中餐再丰富一些就好了，一个人吃中餐没有找到合适的地方。西餐不错,"If the Chinese food is more rich, it is good to find a suitable place to eat Chinese food alone.Western food is good"
0,酒店周围环境差，内部也很旧，卫生不好，很脏，总之没什么好的，下次决不住这。,"The environment around the hotel is poor, the interior is also very old, the hygiene is not good, it is dirty. In short, there is nothing good. I can't help this next time."
0,酒店确实是旧了，房间家具有些都不能用了，连床头灯都坏了，毛巾也感觉脏脏的，房间的隔音效果也特别差，隔壁房间的说话声听得清清楚楚。服务一般，态度不是很好，早餐品种少得可怜。要不是因为离机场非常近，实在是没有优点啊。,"The hotel is indeed old, and some of the room furniture cannot be used. Even the bedside lamps are broken. The towels feel dirty. The sound insulation effect of the room is particularly bad. The words in the room next door are clearly heard.The service is general, the attitude is not very good, and the breakfast varieties are poor.If it wasn't because it was very close to the airport, there was really no advantage."
0,三月三十一日，我夫妇入住这间宾馆。我是按照在携程网上的预定，从火车站步行了约一公里多来到这里的。我太太先去看了房间，然后告诉我，房间一般，是很小，房间外面油漆味很浓烈，难受。她说要我自己上去看看，由我决定。前台接待我们的是个年轻女子，人很热情，不断地向我们推销他们的什么会员卡。说我们现在用他们的会员卡登记入住，马上就可以优惠房价20元。以后在全国，只要入住他们的连锁宾馆，每天都优惠房价20元，还有其他优惠，如就餐九折，积分奖励（免费房）等等。我觉得很烦。若不是携程介绍，我怎么会来你这里呢？可刚一到，你就让我甩掉携程，改用你们的会员身份入住，这不太缺德了吗？他们后来让我看了房间，在走廊上，油漆味太臭了，进了房间，很不舒服，主要是空间太小了。服务员说，有些房间大一点，不过房价贵十元。他领我看了。我们夫妇商量后，决定先住下来。在总台的柜台前，还是那位女孩，正忙着接待一位男子，向他推销会员卡，他接受了。然后那女孩在电脑上替他取消了携程的定单。再对他说，携程可能在晚上会打电话向你调查，为什么没来这里住，你就说，来到长沙已晚了，就没去了。教人撒谎，真恶心！那女孩现在给我办手续了，当然，她还是先向我推销她那宝贝。我明确告诉她，我不愿意为了点小便宜而当他们的会员，这样会牺牲我对酒店的选择权。她变得不再热情，要我付了198元买一间标准间B。我们在房间休息了一会，打算去吃晚饭。我忽然想起，我在携程订的房本来就是说好标准间B，房价是188元。她明知我是携程的，干吗收我198？找她论理去。在他们总台，她说，携程给你留的房间是下午2时至3时，你过了这个时间就不再是携程的定房，你是散客，所以按散客价。我强烈抗议，质问她为什么在开房的时候不告诉我，现在才来讲这个规定。我要求见他们的经理进行投诉。后来来了一个工号007的戴眼镜大个子。此人态度十分恶劣，他说，你过了时间就不是携程定的房，如果算携程的，我们要付给携程每天**元，我们亏大了。我说，我过了3时来，你们就说我携程定房无效，但你们在网上的介绍说离火车站0.5公里，吹牛皮，这又怎么解释。他说网上的介绍不是他写的，他没有责任。我感到他们赚钱很不光明正大，不把住客当朋友（更别说是上帝了）。这几个人的作为，不光让我以后都讨厌莫泰连锁，更有甚者，还动摇了我再到携程网上定房的信心。,"On March 31, my couple stayed in this hotel.I came here for about one kilometer from the railway station according to the reservation on Ctrip.My wife went to see the room first, and then told me that the room was small, and the paint outside the room was strong and uncomfortable.She said that I wanted me to go up and see, and I decided.The front desk received us a young woman, who was very enthusiastic and kept selling them to us what membership card.It is said that we can register with their membership card now, and we can preferentially preferential house prices 20 yuan.In the future, as long as they stay in their chain hotels, the preferential house prices are 20 yuan per day, and there are other discounts, such as 10 % off meals, points rewards (free houses) and so on.I feel very annoying.If it wasn't for Ctrip, how could I come here?But as soon as you arrive, you let me throw away Ctrip and switch to your membership status. Isn't this lack of virtue?They later asked me to watch the room. In the corridor, the paint was too bad. After entering the room, it was very uncomfortable, mainly because the space was too small.The waiter said that some rooms were larger, but house prices were ten yuan.He led me to see.After we discussed our couple, they decided to live first.In front of the counter of the main station, the girl was busy receiving a man and selling the membership card to him. He accepted it.Then the girl canceled the Ctrip's order for him on the computer.Then tell him that Ctrip may call you to investigate at night. Why didn't you come here? You said that it was too late to come to Changsha and did not go.Teach people to lie, really disgusting!The girl is now giving me the formalities. Of course, she still sells me her baby first.I explicitly told her that I was unwilling to be their members for small cheapness, which would sacrifice my right to choose the hotel.She became no longer enthusiastic and asked me to pay 198 yuan to buy a standard room B.We took a break in the room for a while and planned to go for dinner.I suddenly remembered that the house I booked in Ctrip was originally a good standard room B, and the house price was 188 yuan.She knows that I am from Ctrip, why do you accept me 198?Find her to reason.At their head office, she said that the room that Ctrip left you for you is from 2 pm to 3 pm. After you pass this time, you will no longer be Ctrip's fixed house.I protested strongly and questioned why she didn't tell me when I opened the house, and now this rule is about.I ask their managers to complain.Later, there was a big glasses with a job number 007.This person's attitude is very bad. He said that you are not a Ctrip's house after time. If you are counted as Ctrip, we have to pay Ctrip ** yuan per day, and we are big.I said, after 3 o'clock, you said that I was invalid for Ctrip's fixed house, but your introduction on the Internet said that 0.5 kilometers away from the train station, bragging, how to explain.He said that the online introduction was not written by him, and he had no responsibility.I feel that they make money, and they are not just bright, and do not treat guests as friends (let alone God).The actions of these people not only made me hate Motai chain in the future, but even more, it also shaken my confidence in the fixed house on Ctrip."
0,"4月5号入住的.真是后悔.虽然是三星,却只是招待所的水准.房间的设施极其陈旧..最要命的是第一天八点多起床后发现竟然没有热水.打到总台总说再等等等.后来干脆说不可能在上午来的热水.真是的!后来到了景区,才发现很多家庭旅馆要好的多,.而且价格便宜.强烈要求携程不要再推荐这个酒店了!","I stayed on April 5th. It really regrets it. Although it is Samsung, it is only the standard of the guest house. The facilities of the room are extremely old .. The most terrible thing is that after getting up at 8 o'clock on the first day, I found that there was no hot water.Say about waiting. Later, I simply said that it was impossible to come in the morning. Really! Later, when I arrived at the scenic area, I found that many family hotels were much better. And the price was cheap. It was strongly required that Ctrip would not recommend this hotel anymore!"
1,新华酒店地理位置比较好，内部设施不错，可供选择的餐厅较多，服务比较热情。,"Xinhua Hotel has a good geographical location, internal facilities is good, there are many restaurants available for choice, and the services are more enthusiastic."
1,服务算可以设施老旧空调太吵在济南，也没别的好选择,"The service calculation can be facilities, the old air conditioner is too noisy in Jinan, and there is no other good choice"
0,前台服务态度不好，不能替客户考虑，宾馆装修，噪音很大，,"The service attitude of the front desk is not good, and you cannot consider it for customers. The hotel decoration is very noisy."
1,这次在51期间通过电话订的2间豪华单间，到了一看，豪华单间就象套房一样，还是一室一厅的，位于22楼，视野开阔，客厅还放了很多介绍洛阳的旅游书。酒店地理位置也可以，离龙门石窟只有12公里，离市中心1公里。不足就是酒店设施稍旧。,"This time during the 51st period, the two luxury single rooms were booked by the phone. At a glance, the luxury single room was like a suite, or one room and one living room. It was located on the 22nd floor. The field of vision was wide.The hotel's geographical location is also available, only 12 kilometers away from Longmen Grottoes, 1 kilometer from the city center.The shortage is that the hotel facilities are slightly old."
1,房间、地点都不错，服务也可以，就是房间里的空调不好，温度上不去有点冷，洗手间的温度反而很高。,"The rooms and locations are good, the service is okay, that is, the air conditioner in the room is not good, the temperature is not cold, and the temperature in the bathroom is very high."
1,房间舒适，环境不错，离火车站近，夜晚还是很安静的，很满意！,The room is comfortable and the environment is good. It is close to the railway station. It is still quiet at night and very satisfied!
1,应该算是目前当地最好的酒店了。但不可期望值过高。宾馆反馈2008年4月14日：满足您的需要是酒店不断努力的目标。,"It should be regarded as the best local hotel.But it is not expected to be too high.Hotel feedback on April 14, 2008: Meeting your needs is the goal of continuous efforts in the hotel."
1,"整个酒店的环境还是不错的,迎宾楼建的较早些,所以里面的设施有些旧,大概准四星级别,但是宜昌很漂亮,气侯非常舒服.","The environment of the entire hotel is still good. The welcome building was built earlier, so the facilities inside are a bit old, probably the four -star level, but Yichang is very beautiful and the gas is very comfortable."
1,服务不错，性价比还可以。娱乐项目较多！房间不大。,"The service is good, and the cost performance is okay.There are many entertainment projects!The room is not big."
1,"非常的好,服务很热情,房间很新很干净,交通也算方便","Very good, the service is very enthusiastic, the room is new and clean, and the transportation is also convenient"
0,差差差，房间大而家具太差，有早餐而早餐质量太差，有宽带而网速极差，几乎等于零。环境好而交通太差。,"The difference is different, the room is large and the furniture is too poor, the quality of breakfast is too poor, there is broadband and the network speed is extremely poor, which is almost equal to zero.The environment is good and the traffic is too poor."
1,位置一般，去西湖打车要12块左右，从机场打车过来是84块。。。房间比想象中的好很多，干净细致，没有任何怪味道。被褥也很舒适。空调制冷强劲，有一个网线接口可以免费上网，但是无线上网几乎不行。电梯明亮，房间打扫也很细心周到，每层都有一个报纸栏放当日报纸免费取阅。门童非常有礼貌且敬业，下雨天会打伞为客人开车门，见面都会问好。前台态度也很好，恭恭敬敬，微笑服务，很耐心也很热心。住店过程中发生了一点不愉快的事情，但是这和酒店前台以及服务无关，感觉该酒店的客房部门主管定房以及签单的人员非常的没有素质，携程在这件事里也非主观地扮演了很恶心的角色。但不管如何，事情最终解决的结果我还算满意。而且我对这个酒店也很满意。住着真的是很舒服！,"The position is average. It takes about 12 taxis to the West Lake, and it is 84 yuan from the airport to take a taxi.EssenceEssenceThe room is much better than expected, clean and meticulous without any strange taste.The bedding is also very comfortable.The air -conditioning refrigeration is strong. There is a network cable interface to access the Internet for free, but wireless Internet access is almost impossible.The elevator is bright, and the room is very careful and thoughtful. Each floor has a newspaper bar and free to read the newspaper on the day.Gate children are very polite and dedicated. When it rains, she will drive an umbrella to drive the door for guests. I will ask well when they meet.The attitude of the front desk is also very good, respectful and respectful, smile service, very patient and enthusiastic.A little unpleasant thing happened during the shop, but this has nothing to do with the hotel's front desk and service. I feel that the hotel's room department is in charge of the fixed house and the person who signed the bill.Very disgusting character.But in any case, I am satisfied with the result of the final solution.And I am also very satisfied with this hotel.It's really comfortable to live!"
1,大楼很漂亮。价格不便宜。其他一般。就是索菲特听起来很牛。,The building is beautiful.The price is not cheap.Other ordinary.It sounds like Sofitt.
1,感觉性价比不是很高我定的是豪华房可是房间根本看不出豪华样来房间倒是设计的很好也很干净不过总是觉得作为快捷商务酒店是够了四星级的标准还是需要些什么在酒店门口打车非常不方便而且有很多大爷大娘再行乞可怕的是他们不是走过来叫你而是用手扒拉你靠有时候从后面过来的一扒拉我还给我吓一跳呢,"It feels that the price / performance ratio is not very high. I set a luxurious room, but the room does not see the luxurious appearance at all. The room is well designed and clean.Taking a taxi at the entrance of the hotel is very inconvenient. There are many uncle and ladies begging again. They are not coming over to ask you but pulling you with a hand chop. Sometimes it ’s scared."
0,"非常不值得的一个酒店.179的价格绝对不值!其他连锁酒店99元100元都比这个强啊!!房间很小,位置不好,早餐很差!","The price of a hotel that is not worth it is absolutely not worth the price! Other chain hotels are stronger than this !! The room is small, the location is not good, and the breakfast is poor!"
1,"可以,不错,好呀,----就是有点贵呀","Yes, yes, okay, ---- It's a bit expensive"
0,定得是豪华套间，但一点都不豪华。酒店周围打车不方便，特别在上下班时很困难，也没有地铁或者公交等，周围也没什么饭店。酒店得早餐比较差，餐厅小，吃饭得人多，吃的东西也很少。离铁轨太近，火车开过山摇地动。我住了5天，而且从没提过中途退房，最后携程告诉我酒店说我只住了2天就退房了，虽然最后是解决了，但很不爽唯一好得，酒店工作人员还比较热情,"It is determined to be luxurious, but it is not luxurious at all.It is inconvenient to taxi around the hotel, especially when it is difficult to get off work. There are no subways or buses, and there are no restaurants around.The hotel has a poor breakfast, a small restaurant, a lot of people, and few foods.Too close to the raily, the train drove the mountain.I lived for 5 days and never mentioned check -in. Finally, Ctrip told me that the hotel said that I only stayed for 2 days and checked out. Although it was resolved in the end, it was very unhappy.enthusiasm"
1,总体感觉不错，南通总共住过有斐，文峰，三德。比较起来还是三德性价比最高：1。跟前面TX有同感，有斐徒有其表，房间隔音极差，让你觉得隔壁是在你的洗手间里冲澡呢；2。文峰的外部环境是我喜欢的，不过普通房间设施陈旧（新楼还凑合）；而且服务系统也有问题。一晚上打了我三个电话，就因为我登记时用的是驾驶证而不是身份证。3。跟以上俩比较，三德的房间最好，特别是豪华大床房，很舒适，而且现在国内电话和宽带都无限量供应了。很棒。缺点是早餐有点单一，（可能我吃的次数太多了，感觉一两年了每次都一样，呵呵）,"Overall feels good. Nantong lived in total, Wenfeng, Sande.The comparison is the highest cost -effective: 1.I feel the same as the previous TX, there is a table with Fifu, the room's sound insulation is extremely poor, making you feel that the next door is bathing in your bathroom; 2.The external environment of Wenfeng is what I like, but the ordinary room facilities are old (the new building is still together); and the service system also has problems.I made three calls one night, because I used a driver's license instead of an ID card when I registered.3.Compared with the above two, Sande's room is the best, especially the luxurious large bed room, which is very comfortable, and now the domestic telephone and broadband are unlimited.great.The disadvantage is that breakfast is a bit single, (maybe I have eaten too many times, I feel the same time for a year or two, haha)"
1,不错。有一点不好，我们在二楼餐厅用餐时，看到菜谱做的很精美，有漂亮的照片。我们想买下来做纪念，结果一个经理（可能）想蒙我们吧，说可以卖给我们，但要300美元，合2000多RMB.,"good.One thing is not good. When we dine on the second -floor restaurant, we saw that the recipe was very beautiful and had beautiful photos.We want to buy it for a commemorative. As a result, a manager (maybe) wants to be able to sell us, saying that it can be sold to us, but it costs $ 300, more than 2000 RMB."
0,"环境和设施都不好,提前预订的不靠铁轨的房间没给保留,整晚的火车汽笛声影响了睡眠","The environment and facilities are not good, and the rooms that are not relying on the railway are not reserved in advance. The sound of trains all night affects sleep."
1,整体环境比较不错，很有别墅的感觉，但是唯一不足的就是房间比较陈旧，另外正是在旅游旺季的时候如果你还想继续住的话是不可以延期的，必须退房，这样比较难找到其他酒店，基本上是无处可去的了。,"The overall environment is relatively good, and it feels like a villa, but the only disadvantage is that the room is relatively old. In addition, it is not extended if you want to continue to live during the peak tourist season. You must check out.The hotel is basically nowhere to go."
1,离外滩五分钟步行即到，而且正对着外滩观光隧道，想到东方明珠和金茂游玩比较方便，去南京路也相对近。这次订的是没有窗户的大床房。房间空间较小，但尚算可以接受，因为只住一晚的缘故。但酒店的空调和热水壶都出现故障，上海的节能工作做得真是好，连基本的空调环境都达不到。住在房间里不知天黑天白，因为没有窗户，所以第二天几乎睡到十点，要早起的朋友一定要记得闹铃。洗手间是整体浴室，空间刚刚好，洗手台面比较小，其他尚算可以接受。总的来说，中规中矩。如果喜欢住在外滩附近的朋友可以考虑选择。还有一点值得表扬的，楼层设置了公用电脑可以上网的。提供了方便。,"Walking away from the Bund for five minutes, and facing the Bund Tunnel, it is more convenient to think of Oriental Pearl and Jinmao. It is relatively close to Nanjing Road.This time, there is no big bed room without windows.The room space is small, but it is still acceptable because it is only one night.However, the hotel's air -conditioning and hot kettle have failed. The energy conservation work in Shanghai is really good, and even the basic air -conditioning environment cannot be reached.I do n’t know the dark and white in the room, because there is no window, so I almost sleep at ten o'clock the next day. Friends who get up early must remember the alarm.The toilet is the overall bathroom. The space is just right. The toilet table is relatively small. Others are still acceptable.Overall, it is quite satisfactory.If you like to live near the Bund, you can consider choosing.It is also worthy of praise. Public computers can access the Internet on the floor.Convenient."
1,住过之后发现前面同志的点评果真不错，酒店服务很到位。除了房型差了一些之外，服务没得说。补充点评2008年7月27日：现在细细评价一下酒店吧。1、酒店的设备一般，作为四星酒店没有相应的公共及健康娱乐设施。2、酒店的门童对于内宾比较呆滞，对于外宾比较热情。3、房型需要改造。4、去住的时候酒店在墙体外悬挂大幅宣传条幅，晚上风大挂的条幅很响，影响睡眠。说说好的1、酒店的服务很好，尤其是我住的楼层的保洁大姐，简直好的不得了。我去的时候烟台大雨，鞋和袜子都湿漉漉的。酒店工作人员在我不在客房时帮我把袜子洗了，鞋吹干了。还留了字条说明情况，字条我到现在还留着，服务员是吕淑红。2、酒店配套的早餐不错，很丰富的品种。3、酒店没有骚扰电话。但是在早上的时候有女士敲房门问是否有要按摩服务。女士很漂亮。,"After living, I found that the comrades 'comrades' comrades were really good, and hotel services were in place.Except for the room type, the service is not said.Supplementary comment July 27, 2008: Let's take a closer look at the hotel now.1. The hotel's equipment is average. As a four -star hotel, there is no corresponding public and healthy entertainment facilities.2. The hotel's door children are dull and enthusiastic about foreign guests.3. The room type needs to be transformed.4. When I live, the hotel hangs a large publicity banner outside the wall.Talk about good 1. The service of the hotel is very good, especially the cleaning sister of the floors I live in.When I went, Yantai rained, shoes and socks were wet.The hotel staff helped me wash my socks when I was not in the room, and the shoes were dried.I also left a note to explain the situation. I still keep the note. The waiter is Lu Shuhong.2. The hotel has a good breakfast and a rich variety.3. There is no harassment call in the hotel.But in the morning, a lady knocked on the door and asked if there was a massage service.The lady is beautiful."
1,环境还不错，服务也挺热情，但隔音确实不好，早上居然被隔壁的讲话声吵醒了宾馆反馈2008年5月9日：尊敬的宾客：您好！感谢您对我店的认可并提出宝贵意见！我店现已有计划对客房区域进行改造，届时多数客房的隔音问题将得到较大的改善。另我店一楼怡景咖啡厅自五月一日起推出东南亚美食节活动，诚挚地欢迎您来店品尝和感受！,"The environment is not bad, and the service is very enthusiastic, but the sound insulation is really not good. In the morning, it was awakened by the speech next door to the hotel feedback on May 9, 2008: Dear guest: Hello!Thank you for your recognition of our store and put forward valuable comments!Our store has a plan to transform the room area, and the sound insulation problems of most rooms will be greatly improved.In addition, on the first floor of our shop, the Yijing Cafe in the Southeast Asian Food Festival has been launched on May 1st. I sincerely welcome you to come to the store to taste and feel!"
1,"典型的快捷酒店的风格，房间不错，淋浴很舒服,早餐十分的丰盛,在郑州当地此酒店好象十分的出名","The style of a typical express hotel, the room is good, the shower is very comfortable, the breakfast is very rich, and the hotel in Zhengzhou seems to be very famous."
1,酒店设施一般，老酒店的确如广大网友所言，设施显得有点旧，但很干净，能住；环境不错，有一个树木很多的大院子，对面即美庐，离牯岭镇中心十多分钟脚程；服务的确不错，很礼貌，能热心帮助解决问题；还有一点是该酒店并不是没有网络，但是是无线的，如自已的笔记本有无线网卡就能上网，网速还可以，没有无线网卡也可在总台租用，十元钱就能租到你离店为止，但只有楼梯附近的房间有信号,"The hotel facilities are average. Indeed, as the majority of netizens said, the facilities are a bit old, but they are very clean and able to live; there are a large yard with a lot of trees.Cheng; the service is really good, very polite, and enthusiastically helps solve the problem; another point is that the hotel is not without the network, but it is wireless. For exampleYou can also rent it on the main station, and you can rent it at ten yuan, but only the room near the stairs has signal"
1,交通挺方便，服务也不错，附近走不远就有很多吃的地方，挺好，就是电梯需要用房间钥匙很麻烦。补充点评2008年7月14日：电视的台少了些，就那么十来个吧，还很多外国台，国内的地方台大部分看不到，这点不怎么好。,"The transportation is very convenient and the service is good. There are many places to eat nearby nearby. It is very good that the elevator needs to use the room key.Supplementary comment on July 14, 2008: There are fewer TV platforms, so do a dozen one. There are many foreign Taiwan. Most of the domestic places in China cannot see it. This is not very good."
1,除了咖啡吧那硬硬的巧克力蛋糕，其他服务都符合喜来登的标准，有宾至如归的感觉。,"Except for the hard chocolate cake, other services meet the standards of Xilai, and have the feeling of guests."
1,酒店的位置非常好，过了街就是繁华的南京路，离地铁站也特别近。酒店的硬件在4星级里面算是不错的，服务也很好，可能开业的时间比较长了，房间里略显的有点旧，而且接近1000一晚的价格不能免费上网也有点不太人性化。也许上海稍微上点档次的酒店都是这样吧。总的来说还算满意，下次还会考虑入住。,"The hotel's location is very good. After the street, it is a bustling Nanjing Road, and it is particularly close to the subway station.The hotel's hardware is good in the 4 -star level, the service is also very good, the opening time may be relatively long, the room is slightly old, and the price of nearly 1,000 nights cannot be free to access the Internet for free.Maybe it is like this in Shanghai.Overall is quite satisfied, and I will consider staying next time."
1,房间稍微小了点其他没有问题很不错上次和一日本客人一起住的对方很中意因为竟然有NHK,The room is slightly smaller. Other other is not bad. The other person who lives with a Japanese guest is very intended because there is NHK
1,"前台服务态度非常好,房间大小清洁也都不错退房当天早上才通知延至下午三点退房也ok.离万象城近有机会还是会入住.","The front desk service attitude is very good, and the room size is well cleaned. It is also notified that it will be notified until 3 pm on the morning of the day."
1,环境不错，离石老人海滨浴场很近。房间也不错，就是有点吵，离马路近，大清早车声不断，想晚起一会也不行,"The environment is good, and it is very close to the old man of Shi Shi.The room is also good, just a bit noisy, near the road, the sound of the car is constantly in the early morning, and it will not work for a while to get up late for a while."
1,"房间是新的,但质量不太好,窗帘都快掉下来了!房间有厨具可是没机会用!从一楼服务台倒房间要走10分钟且要倒电梯!有些夸张!交通方便,楼下是百货公司.","The room is new, but the quality is not good, the curtains are almost falling! There is a kitchen utensil in the room, but there is no chance to use it! It takes 10 minutes to pour the room from the first floor and pour the elevator! It is exaggerated! Convenient transportation, downstairs, downstairs, downstairs, downstairs, downstairs, downstairsIt's department store."
0,"性价比极低,根本够不上4星的标准.送单早,早餐另外收费,68元/位,上网收费,60元/天.下次再也不住了!","The price/performance ratio is extremely low, and it is not enough for 4 stars at all. Send orders early, breakfast for breakfast, 68 yuan/person, online charging, 60 yuan/day. I ca n’t live again next time!"
1,酒店很不错，大床房床挺大的，房间也挺大，各方面的设施都不错，卫生间里有浴缸和淋浴两个独立的空间，服务也很周到，入住第二天晚上还专门打电话来问对酒店有什么意见和建议。酒店一出门就栈桥，离五四广场稍有点远，打车大概十来二十块钱。总体来说真不错，下次到青岛的话还会选这家酒店。,"The hotel is very good, the big bed is quite large, the room is quite large, and the facilities in all aspects are good. There are two independent spaces in the bathtub and shower in the bathroom.Come and ask what opinions and suggestions for the hotel.As soon as the hotel goes out, it is a little far away from the May 4th Plaza.Overall it is really good. If you come to Qingdao next time, you will choose this hotel."
1,"酒店情况很好,早餐还行.就是长沙的出租车太脏,长沙火车站的候车室(掏10元钱的那个)空气太差,候车室厕所没人维护.劝大家不要上当受骗.","The hotel is in good condition, and the breakfast is okay. It is that the taxi in Changsha is too dirty. The air of the waiting room of the Changsha Railway Station (the one with 10 yuan) is too bad. No one is maintained in the waiting room toilet. It is advised everyone not to be deceived."
0,前台和餐厅服务太差，吃早餐不能签单，房间有霉味，骚扰电话太多，房间太小，周围全是装饰市场，环境太乱。另外到哈尔滨的朋友请注意：从机场到市区的出租车计价器全有问题，显示的价格一般都要高50--100元，实际正常应该在80元左右，过路费20元，这个问题反映很强烈，也从没有人管。只要我们自己注意砍价了。,"The front desk and restaurant services are too bad. You ca n’t sign for breakfast. The room has a moldy smell, too much harassment phone calls, the room is too small, and the surroundings are full of decorative markets. The environment is too chaotic.In addition, friends who arrive at Harbin, please note: There are all problems with the taxi device from the airport to the urban area. The price of the display is generally 50--100 yuan. The actual normal should be around 80 yuan.The reflection is very strong, and no one has been in charge.As long as we pay attention to bargaining."
1,去年住的希尔顿，今年住万豪。万豪的房间明显要小一些。第一天刚来的时候女儿在车上睡着了，我抱着她下车，老公拿大包行李下了车，门童居然在聊天也不来帮一下，不过后几天的门童都还不错。再就是房间没有沙滩袋，很不方便。不过酒店还是很气派漂亮。,"Hilton, who lived last year, lived in Marriott this year.Marriott's room is obviously smaller.When I first arrived on the first day, my daughter fell asleep in the car. I held her out of the car. My husband got out of the car with a large bag of luggage.not bad.Then there is no beach bag in the room, which is very inconvenient.However, the hotel is still very beautiful."

1,酒店感觉不错，细节考虑比较周到，房价略显贵了些，标准间两个人住有点小。,"The hotel feels good, the details are considered thoughtful, the house prices are slightly more expensive, and the standard rooms are a bit small."
1,住过几次，感觉还可以。但这次竟然晚上冷的睡不着。穿上毛衣毛裤，盖了3床被子，夸张吧？空调里也是热风，但房间温度就是低，而且外面也不是很冷。真是想不明白。换了一个房间，还是一样。只好退房了！,"I have lived a few times, and it feels okay.But this time I couldn't sleep coldly at night.Put on sweater pants and cover 3 beds, exaggerated?The air conditioner is also hot air, but the temperature of the room is low, and the outside is not very cold.I really don't understand.After changing a room, the same is true.Have to check out!"
1,"酒店设施稍显陈旧,但干净整洁,早餐六点开始(很好),品种较多,但明档的食品六点去是吃不到的,略显遗憾啊","The hotel facilities are slightly old, but clean and tidy, starting at six o'clock (very good), there are many varieties, but the open -stall food is not eaten at six o'clock."
1,本人于2008年6月5日入住该酒店标准间。装修很别致，设施也不错，前台服务很好。早餐品种不多，但味道不错，香菇包子令人回味无穷，价格也还公道。但酒店的房价略微高了一点。,"I stayed at the hotel standard room on June 5, 2008.The decoration is very unique, the facilities are also good, and the front desk service is very good.There are not many breakfast varieties, but the taste is good. The mushroom buns are endless, and the price is fair.But the hotel's house price is slightly higher."
0,事实上只能算一个好一点的招待所，只是大堂装修得好一点而已,"In fact, it can only be regarded as a better reception, but the lobby is better decorated"
1,地点较好，还给免费升级了，感觉好了很多，就是价格太高了。,"The location is better, and it has been upgraded for free. It feels much better, but the price is too high."
1,各方面都一般，只要期望值不太高就还可以。,"All aspects are average, as long as the expected value is not too high."
1,我订的大床房，房间还不错，就是卫生间布局不好，淋浴的地方很小，还就一个帘子用来挡水，淋浴的时候，卫生间地面就到处是水，很不方便。酒店房间价格怎么突然就涨价了？我入住的时候价格是298，现在的价格贵了很多哦！新价格没有什么优势了。。。宾馆反馈2008年7月28日：您入住的时候正好是春节期间的网络订房优惠价活动时间，并不是酒店涨价了。谢谢您的宝贵意见。,"The big bed room I booked is not bad, that is, the layout of the bathroom is not good, the shower place is small, and a curtain is used to block the water. When the shower is shower, the toilet floor is water everywhere, which is very inconvenient.Why does the price of hotel room suddenly increase the price?When I stayed, the price was 298, and the price is much more expensive now!The new price has no advantage.EssenceEssenceHotel feedback on July 28, 2008: When you move in, you happen to be the time for online reservations during the Spring Festival, not the hotel price.Thank you for your valuable opinions."
1,"周围环境不错,就是房间太旧了.还有兑换外币也不很方便.","The surrounding environment is good, that is, the room is too old. It is not convenient to exchange foreign currency."
1,建议通过携程网上预定标准间最好含两份早餐。,It is recommended to have two breakfast in the Ctrip online scheduled standard room.
1,是一个别墅式的温泉，非常清静，服务也不错，性价比较高。就是交通有点不便，同时一定不要选一楼的房间，因为潮湿有一股很浓的味道。如果是单独旅游，最好的办法是包一辆出租车，一天才150元，还可以请司机介绍景点，上次我请了一个出租车，人不错，我介绍一下大家认识：李志宁13988505869,"It is a villa -style hot spring. It is very quiet, the service is also good, and the cost is relatively high.It is a bit inconvenient for traffic. At the same time, do not choose the room on the first floor, because humidity has a strong taste.If you travel alone, the best way is to include a taxi, which is only 150 yuan a day. You can also ask the driver to introduce the attractions. Last time I invited a taxi, people are good, let me introduce it to everyone: Li Zhining 13988505869"
1,装修比较老。床不是很舒服，有点硬。楼下的茶餐厅18快自助还不错。服务还可以。宾馆反馈2008年4月11日：首先感谢您的光临，对于您提出的问题我们会酌情处理并进行整改，希望您下次来时能有更好的感觉。另外非常感谢您对我们酒店咖啡厅的推荐，以及对我们服务的肯定，我们会继续努力的。,"The decoration is older.The bed is not very comfortable and a bit hard.The tea restaurant downstairs 18 fast self -service is not bad.The service is okay.Hotel feedback on April 11, 2008: First of all, thank you for your visit.

I hope you can feel better next time you come.Thank you very much for your recommendation to our hotel cafe and affirmation of our service. We will continue to work hard."
1,"就是离市区远了些,出门不是很方便.周边基础设施比较少点.其他的还可以,","It is far from the city, it is not very convenient to go out. The surrounding infrastructure is relatively small."
1,"房间设施有些陈旧了。值得欣慰的是，宽带速度还可以。宾馆反馈2008年1月14日：感谢您对我们宽带的认可,其他方面我们也会努力,欢迎您再次光临惠顾!","The room facilities are old.It is gratifying that the broadband speed is okay.Hotel feedback on January 14, 2008: Thank you for your recognition of our broadband. We will also work hard in other aspects. Welcome to visit Gu Gu!"
0,这是我在香港住过的最烂的酒店。预定的是大床房，结果第一次给我一间双床房，第二次换了房，倒是大床房，但这间房间的的洗手间基本没装修，所有水管暴露在外，所有设备都是简装的，洗脸盆小的只能放进一直手，太吓人了。大家一定要当心。结果第三次终于换到了稍微像样的房间（因为看到过前面的那间房，所有眼界已经低了很多）。但房间真得是很旧，出门跨半步就是电梯，走道窄的只能走一人。建议如果是这个预算，情愿去住离此酒店很近的香港华美达酒店，绝对比这个酒店设试新而且离中环相对较近。以前还住过香港华美粤海酒店，差不多650一天，绝对要比这家好。不过这家总算还有个优点，就是自助早餐很丰盛，但其实价格要比钱两个酒店贵好多！,"This is the worst hotel I have lived in Hong Kong.The booked bedroom was scheduled. As a result, I gave me a double bed room for the first time, and changed the room for the second time, but it was a large bed room, but the toilet in this room was basically not decorated. All water pipes were exposed. All equipment was all equipment.It is simple, and the small washbasin can only be put in the hands, which is too scary.Everyone must be careful.As a result, the third time was finally changed to a slightly decent room (all the horizons were much lower because I saw the room in front).But the room is really old. When you go out and cross half a step, you can only walk one person with narrow walkway.It is recommended that if it is this budget, I am willing to live in Huameida Hotel, which is close to this hotel, which is definitely new and closer to the Central.I have lived in Huamei Yuehai Hotel in Hong Kong before, almost 650 a day, which is definitely better than this one.However, this one has a advantage that the buffet breakfast is rich, but in fact the price is much more expensive than the two hotels!"
1,这个地段这个价位这个服务的酒店，算是很难得了。,This price and this service hotel is rare.
1,"在网上看到新世界的点评,挺不错!于是这次出差选择了这家酒店。自已亲身体会一下，感觉还挺好。270元的商务双人房，不仅免费上网，而且还包早餐，值得！酒店不仅服务好，而且房间卫生也很干净。地理位置不错，在市中心，交通非常方便，出门步行5分钟可到达西门口地铁站。而酒店唯一不足就是提供的西式早餐供应太慢，可能是因为我周末入住的缘故。总体来说，是间挺不错的酒店，挺好，值得选择入住！！！","I saw the reviews of the new world on the Internet, which is good! So I chose this hotel on a business trip.I experienced it in person, and it feels pretty good.The 270 yuan business double room, not only free online, but also breakfast, it is worth it!The hotel is not only good -service, but also the room hygiene is also very clean.The geographical location is good. In the center of the city, the transportation is very convenient. It can be reached to the West Gate subway station for 5 minutes.The only shortcoming in the hotel is that the Western -style breakfast supply provided is too slow, probably because I stayed in the weekend.Overall, it is a very good hotel. It is good and worth choosing to stay!IntersectionIntersection"
1,这里宽带费用太高。每分钟1.5元。超过30分钟就成一天计算了。在目前很多酒店免费使用宽带的时候，显得不合时宜。即使收费，我认为也是10元以下为好。最好是不收费。这样利用客人更会多了。补充点评2006年8月25日：对了，顺便提一下，这家酒店的空调声音巨大，如果您想安静入睡，最好忍受高温而把空调关上。其实没有什么客人来访的话，不如住旁边的如家。又便宜，又实惠。价格是这家酒店的1/3以下。宽带还免费。,"Here the broadband cost is too high.1.5 yuan per minute.It is calculated in one day more than 30 minutes.When many hotels are free to use broadband at present, it seems unsuccessful.Even if it is charged, I think it is better to be less than 10 yuan.It is best not to charge.It will be more useful to use guests in this way.Supplementary comment on August 25, 2006: By the way, by the way, the air conditioning sound of this hotel is huge. If you want to sleep quietly, it is best to endure the high temperature and turn off the air conditioner.In fact, if there are no guests who come to visit, it is better to live in the home next to it.It is cheap and affordable.The price is less than one -third of this hotel.Broadband is also free."
1,再次入住，没有太多惊喜，也没有太多烦厌，平平常常，普普通通！,"Check in again, there are not many surprises, there are not too much annoying, ordinary, ordinary!"
1,仅为个人观点，供参考。位的普通大床房。在市中心，位置尚可；设施较好，只是房间中的自制沙发不是很适合长时间座，但关系不大；房间有些窄，床和写字台之间只能放一张椅子。总的讲虽有些不足但总体不错，应该是重庆的集团，在重庆有多家店。下次去成都如果没有找到性价比更好的，还住这里。,"For personal views, for reference.Ordinary large bed room.In the city center, the location is acceptable; the facilities are good, but the homemade sofa in the room is not suitable for long -term seats, but it is not related; the room is a bit narrow, and only one chair can be placed between the bed and the writing desk.In general, although there are some shortcomings, it is generally good. It should be Chongqing's group, and there are many stores in Chongqing.The next time I went to Chengdu, I did not find a better price -performance ratio, and I still live here."
1,环境不错、床单毛巾洁净、服务还行、房间宽敞，但感觉茶几、桌椅、地毯、浴帘有点脏，床垫不太舒服。总之，可以打4分。谢谢！,"The environment is good, the sheets are clean, the service is okay, and the room is spacious, but it feels that the coffee tables, tables and chairs, carpets, and shower curtains are a bit dirty, and mattresses are not comfortable.In short, you can score 4 points.Thanks!"
1,在株洲基本没有别的选择了，只能这家！总体房间还可以，但是吃早餐的地方太小了，非常拥挤，而且品种也很少！,"There is basically no other choice in Zhuzhou, only this one!The overall room is okay, but the place for breakfast is too small, very crowded, and there are very few varieties!"
1,酒店各方面设施完善，服务各方面也较好，就是位置比较偏。离市中心较远。,"The facilities in all aspects of the hotel are perfect, and all aspects of the service are better, but the location is relatively biased.Far away from the city center."
0,很差，去到餐厅后发现什么也没有，当初在携程预定时所谓的双早根本没兑现，我们几位连早餐都没吃就结账走了，这个宾馆太需要改进了！,"It was very bad. After going to the restaurant, I found nothing. At first, the so -called double early early in Ctrip was not fulfilled. A few of us went out without eating breakfast. This hotel needs to be improved too!"
1,哈哈，名副其实，这是我住过的最阔气的酒店，进了大厅2分钟没有找到前台。建议入口处多安排几名迎宾，重要的要保证每时每刻都有迎宾指路，我到的时候刚好没有，呵呵。,"Haha, the name is actually the most angry hotel I have lived. I didn't find the front desk for 2 minutes when I entered the lobby.It is recommended to arrange a few more welcome at the entrance. The important thing is to ensure that there is a welcoming way at all times."
0,2008年7月29日入住三人房一晚，虽说是套房，但是只有一个空调出风口，一间房冻死，一间房还行。淋浴房的水是往外流的，洗个澡卫生间湿了一半了。花洒有很大问题出水极小，要求更换了，还是一样的毛病，根本没法洗头。到半夜大概11点多的时候，我的房间居然会停电，我只开了空调和电视，一人在洗澡而已。还有就是早餐基本没什么吃的。,"On July 29, 2008, he stayed in the three -person room for one night. Although it was a suite, there was only one air -conditioned outlet, a room frozen to death, and a room was okay.The water in the shower room flows out, and the bathroom is wet halfway.The shower has a lot of problems. It is very small. It is required to be replaced. It is still the same problem.At about 11 o'clock in the middle of the night, my room would stop power. I only turned on the air -conditioning and TV, and I was taking a bath.There is nothing to eat for breakfast."
0,真的差得没话说，但说起来又有一堆。住进去的时候发现没有浴巾，第二天却一直打电话说我们拿了那两块浴巾，害得我们6个人一直在等所谓的经理出现解决这两块浴巾的事情。环境还很差，住的房间又小又暗。不要被它的外境给骗了,"It's really so bad, but there is a bunch of it.When I lived in, I found that there was no bath towel, but the next day I called and said that we took the two bath towels, which caused six people to wait for the so -called manager to solve these two bath towels.The environment was still poor, and the room where he lived was small and dark.Don't be deceived by its outside world"
1,"海景房果然名不虚传,可以看到整个港岛的景色.服务也很周到.交通也算方便,就是打车去港岛成本比较高,购物很方便,酒店旁边就有SOGO.总体来说,非常好的酒店.绝对值得一住.","The sea view room is really well -known. You can see the scenery of the entire Hong Kong Island. The service is also very thoughtful. The transportation is also convenient, that is, the cost of taking a taxi to Hong Kong Island is relatively high and the shopping is very convenient. Generally speaking, there is SOGO. Generally speaking, it is very good. It is very good.Hotel. It is definitely worth living."
0,网速非常慢，玩qq游戏都卡了很长时间结帐也挺慢服务员过于积极房间还比较大，就是电视效果很差性价比不高，还要200多,The speed of the network is very slow. Playing QQ games is stuck for a long time. The checkout is very slow. The waiter is too positive and the room is relatively large.
1,非常不错，实惠，虽然不含早餐，但是也很实惠，房间很大很干净，地理位置不错，卫生设施一流，下次一定还选,"Very good, affordable, although it does not include breakfast, but it is also very affordable."
1,"上周来千岛湖度假,在网上预订了该酒店,非常不错,很适合度假的自驾车家庭,酒店离千岛湖城区不过二分钟的车程,在一个单独的山坡上,很大气，环境非常好,安静、酒店有很大区域的绿化，早晨起床绕酒店走走感觉不要太好，酒店大堂前的平台上看出去就是千岛湖，很美丽。酒店几幢房子由连廊连接而成，晚上在连廊上就可以看到千岛湖镇广场的喷泉及夜景，还有个室外的游泳池，免费的，真好。有房间里可以直接看到千岛湖，湖上岛坞一个个错落有致。唯一就是房间设施略显陈旧，卫生倒是做得非常好。餐厅的鱼头味道不错，价格也合适，早餐稍显单调，蒸老南瓜很好吃，绿色食品，不过一个房间的两份早餐，我带着小朋友服务人员也人性化的免费的，感觉还是不错的。还有一点很重要，这里的服务人员都很有礼貌，在三星酒店来说，很难得，看得出酒店管理还是不错的。当然，最最重要的是，价格很合适，也许设备设施不如其它高星级的酒店，但相比价格而言，性价比还是蛮高的了。下次来千岛湖还会住假日饭店，当然中彩票大奖后除外！","Last week, Qiandao Lake was vacated. The hotel was booked online. It was very good. It was very suitable for self -driving families for vacation.Quiet, the hotel has a large area of greening. When I get up in the morning, I feel that it should not be very good. The platform in front of the hotel lobby seems to be Qiandao Lake, which is very beautiful.Several hotel houses are connected from the corridor. At night, you can see the fountain and night view of Qiandaohu Town Square in the corridor at night. There is also an outdoor swimming pool. It is free and good.You can see Qiandao Lake directly in the room.The only thing is that the room facilities are slightly old, and hygiene is doing very well.The fish head in the restaurant tastes good and the price is also appropriate. The breakfast is slightly monotonous. The steamed old pumpkin is delicious and green food.of.It is also important. The service staff here are very polite. For Samsung Hotel, it is rare. It can be seen that hotel management is still good.Of course, the most important thing is that the price is very suitable. Perhaps the equipment and facilities are not as good as other high -star hotels, but compared with the price, the price / performance ratio is still quite high.The next time you come to Qiandao Lake, you will stay in the Holiday Hotel. Of course, except after the lottery prize!"
0,和楼下的朋友感触差不多，这个酒店的硬件和服务都一般，住15层豪华单人间，电视不清楚，床硬，被子薄，空调温度不够，晚上睡的不舒服，冷。卫生间设施还比较不错，装修不久的缘故吧。经当地人的推荐，我下次来这个城市会选择，新开的赵王或者开发区的皇冠，也向大家推荐。,"It is much different from the friends downstairs. The hardware and services of this hotel are average. Living on a 15 -story luxury single room, the TV is unclear, the bed is hard, the quilt is thin, the air conditioner temperature is not enough, and the sleep is uncomfortable at night.The bathroom facilities are still relatively good.After the recommendation of the locals, I will choose this city next time. The newly opened Zhao Wang or the crown of the Development Zone also recommends it to everyone."
0,"前台人员不但英语不好,普通话也不好.不过,大堂吧的服务人员很赞.","The front desk staff is not only bad in English, but also the Mandarin is not good. However, the service staff of the lobby bar is very good."
1,酒店太远。环境各方面一般。但房间很大。服务员的态度很好！,The hotel is too far.All aspects of the environment are average.But the room is large.The waiter's attitude is very good!
1,距拱北关口步行15分钟可以到达，很方便，酒店豪华标准间太小，卫生间设施有点旧，但是热水充足，在改住07系列房间（如16071107）有很大改观，在当地旅行社了解到，通过他们预定价格在300元，与携程网的350元价格有差异，早餐品种不多够吃，但是服务不错，我们早上7点要出发，没有到早餐开始时间酒店安排打包送到了房间。,"It can be reached 15 minutes from Gongbei Pass. It is very convenient. The luxury room of the hotel is too small, the bathroom facilities are a bit old, but the hot water is sufficient. There is a great change in changing the 07 series (such as 16071107).Through their scheduled price of 300 yuan, the price is different from the 350 yuan of Ctrip.com. The breakfast variety is not enough to eat, but the service is good. We will set off at 7 am. The hotel is arranged to be packed to the room without the start time of breakfast."
1,个人感觉性价比不是很高，与房价相比，服务的质量显然不到位。离店时开发票，服务员竟告知用完了。不适合商旅出行，居家旅游倒是还可以，可以做饭、烫衣服，还有洗衣机，酒店挺干净，设施也比较齐全。,"Personally, the price / performance ratio is not very high. Compared with house prices, the quality of the service is obviously not in place.Invoicing when leaving the store, the waiter told that it was done.Not suitable for business travel, home travel is okay. You can cook, hot clothes, and washing machines. The hotel is clean and the facilities are relatively complete."
1,卫生总的是挺好～细节上，有点点瑕疵．我很喜欢房间的布局～周围的环境真的很安静，在旅途劳顿后睡了香香觉～嘿嘿，不过成都的门牌号不规范，找了一下下才找到的．服务相对还说是不错的了,"Hygiene is always good ~ Details, a bit flawed.I like the layout of the room very much ~ The surrounding environment is really quiet. After the trip, I slept Xiang Xiangjue ~ Hey, but Chengdu's house number was not standardized, and found it after finding it.The service is relatively good"
1,服务很好，房间也很明亮，性价比还算不错。,"The service is very good, the room is also very bright, and the cost -effectiveness is pretty good."
1,还是很幽静，设施也不错，但是服务水平和以前几年比急剧下滑了，接线员和客房服务中心的服务极差，幸好我不是很在乎。,"It is still very quiet and the facilities are also good, but the service level has declined sharply than the previous years. The service of the workers and the guest room service center is very poor. Fortunately, I don't care very much."
1,周围环境还可以，购物方便。房间也是不错，当时我预定的商务间，就是考虑上网方便。但是有时候网络总是偶尔会断。由于它那是一栋及商务于一体的大楼，偶尔还是感觉不是很清静。不过总体还是不错的。,"The surrounding environment is okay, convenient shopping.The room is also good. At that time, the business room I booked was convenient to consider the Internet.But sometimes the Internet always breaks occasionally.Because it is a building that integrates business, it still doesn't feel very quiet.But the overall is good."
1,"环境好,很适合到那里渡假,软硬件设施都不错,房价略高,房间很干净，明亮。早餐比差了点,但因为是在鼓浪屿上的酒店，这里的服务和环境都算是相当的不错了。","The environment is good, it is very suitable for crossing the vacation there. The software and hardware facilities are good, the house prices are slightly higher, and the rooms are clean and bright.Breakfast is worse than, but because it is a hotel on Gulangyu, the services and environment here are quite good."
1,海滩有点名过其实了，也确实远了一点，交通也不方便，但酒店本身是很不错的。在尖沙咀半岛酒店（靠近香港青年会的那一边）有黄金海岸酒店自己的专线巴士，来回都是免费的（楼上有说要收费的，可能是和司机沟通不好）。班次可以到酒店的网站下载（，不建议其它交通方式，这是我的忠告！附近有超市，茶餐厅和麦当劳，要求不高的话吃是没问题的。,"The beach is a bit overwhelmed, and it is a bit far away. The transportation is not convenient, but the hotel itself is very good.On the Tsim Sha Tsui Peninsula Hotel (the side of the Hong Kong Youth Conference), there is a special line buses of the Gold Coast Hotel, and it is free to go back and forth.You can download the hotel's website (not recommended for other traffic methods. This is my advice! There are supermarkets nearby, tea restaurants and McDonald's."
1,第一次住这里，一下呆了10天。总体而言还不错。房间：按经济类型的酒店来说，房间还可以，设施比较好，有独立的电脑，就是网速比较慢，但是有这个配置已经不错了。就是我住的房间烟味比较大，对于不抽烟的人来说，较为难忍受。值得提一下，我住的奇数号房间这一侧十分安静，这一点值得赞赏。环境：周边交通还比较便利，打车还算方便，吃的地方稍微少了一点。就是周边“鸡”店太多，还好我住在酒店没有一个骚扰电话。服务：不错。打扫及时，只是有一次我希望用自己电脑上网时无法连入酒店宽带，上来一个服务员也不懂怎么弄，少有遗憾。总体而言，久悦是不错的选择，只是以后能不能想办法让房间里的空气更清新一点呢？宾馆反馈2008年6月29日：很感谢您对我们酒店的肯定，您提出的宝贵意见我们一定会认真改进，为您下次入住提供更好的服务！,"I stayed here for the first time and stayed for 10 days.Overall is pretty good.Room: According to economy -type hotels, the room is okay, the facilities are better, and there are independent computers, that is, the network speed is slow, but there is this configuration.That is, the smell of smoke in the room I live is more unbearable for people who do not smoke.It is worth mentioning that the side of the strange number room I live is very quiet, which is worthy of appreciation.Environment: The surrounding transportation is relatively convenient, the taxi is convenient, and the place to eat is a little less.There are too many ""chicken"" shops around. Fortunately, there is no harassment call in the hotel.Service: Not bad.Once in time, I just hoped that I could not connect to the hotel broadband when I used my computer to access the Internet. I did n’t know how to get a waiter.Overall, Jiuyue is a good choice, but can you find a way to make the air in the room fresher in the future?Hotel feedback on June 29, 2008: Thank you very much for your affirmation of our hotel. The valuable opinions you put forward will be carefully improved to provide better services for you next time!"

1,境很乾，也很安。我到天津都住家酒店。不浴室有，洗盆都破了。但是大床很舒服。,"The situation is very dry and peaceful.I went to Tianjin Hotel.Without the bathroom, the basin was broken.But the big bed is very comfortable."
1,酒店服务员真好，我被大雨截在长途车站，给酒店电话之后派车接了我。房间不敢恭维，太旧了，而且有味道。总体而言服务还可以。,"The hotel waiter was so good. I was intercepted by the heavy rain at the long -distance station and sent me a car after calling the hotel.The room dare not compliment, it is too old and tastes.Overall the service is okay."
0,本次住进长春国际大厦酒店，对这家位居商业大街而与周围市场经济极不相称的管理太有感受了：1.那天晚上约10点，我们一进酒店大门，霉味扑鼻，顿时意识到这家酒店人气不旺。前台仅有的一位服务员在打电话，滔滔不绝。我们等了数分锺，已经开始不耐烦地叩柜台面，暗示她我们在等她办入住手续，可是她压根就没有意识到我们的存在，眼度不抬。还是后来进来一位服务员，才给办了登记手续。2.好不容易上楼开门，IC-Key开不了门，叫服务员没有人，只能下楼换了一把，还是开不了，叫了服务员来了，才打开了门。丢下行李准备出门吃饭，门却锁不上。倒霉的事情怎么都到我们这里呢？！只能下楼叫服务员，捣鼓了半天确认是门锁有问题，才同意给换房间。3.卫生间简陋不提。一洗澡，水是满地流溢。凭良心，洗澡水是挺猛的。4.第2天早上办理离店手续，服务员说请等片刻，电脑死机，说是中毒了。天啦，要等到何时？说没有办法。因赶路，再三要求下才手工办了退房手续。这叫什么酒店？这是什么服务？连招待所都不如!!!!换3星级！？不难想象为什么霉味。真是倒霉！,"This time I lived in the Changchun International Building Hotel, and I felt that this business street and the surrounding market economy were very disapproved.Realizing that this hotel is not popular.The only waiter in the front desk was calling, and it was endless.We waited a few minutes and had begun to be impatient on the counter, implying that she was waiting for her to check in, but she didn't realize our existence at all, and her eyes were not lifted.Later, I came in a waiter to give the registration procedures.2. After finally going upstairs to open the door, IC-Key couldn't open the door. There were no people in the waiter. They could only go downstairs to change it. They couldn't open it. The waiter came to open the door.Throwing out the luggage and going out for dinner, but the door could not be locked.Why do you get out of unlucky things?IntersectionI can only go downstairs to call the waiter. After a long time, I confirmed that there is a problem with the door lock, and I agreed to change the room.3. The bathroom is simple.When a bath, the water was overflowing.Based on conscience, bathing water is quite fierce.4. On the morning of the 2nd day, the departure procedures are processed. The waiter said for a while. The computer was crashing, saying that it was poisoned.Oh my god, when to wait?There is no way.Due to the rush, the check -out procedure was hand -made again.What is this hotel?What service is this?Not even as much as a guest house !!!! Change 3 stars!IntersectionIt is not difficult to imagine why it is moldy.It's unlucky!"
1,酒店位置优越，房间设施还可以，不太新。我入住的是一个拐角的房间，有点怪味。有旋转餐厅，算是一家比较不错的三星级酒店。,"The hotel location is superior, and the room facilities are okay, not very new.I stayed in a corner room, which was a bit strange.There is a rotating restaurant, which is a relatively good three -star hotel."
1,酒店规模大，楼层没有设置服务人员房间，所以找不到服务员；房间较冷（尤其是一层），订时务必要订二层以上。,"The hotel is large, and there is no service personnel room in the floor, so the waiter cannot be found; the room is cold (especially one floor), and it is necessary to order more than two floors."
1,"房间一般,服务很好,卫生间有异味.被","The room is average, the service is very good, and the bathroom has a odor."
0,我定的大床房，房间靠主干道加上隔音很差，吵得要命，我整晚都没睡着，如果睡眠不好的朋友要考虑一下！,"My big bed room, the room is very poor with the main road and the sound insulation, and the noise is terrible. I didn't fall asleep all night. If you sleep well, please consider it!"
1,开始订的大房单人间，但去了酒店告诉我没有携程预订，我刚要打电话询问，又告诉我有了一间。去看，房间太小，小得刚好放一张床。于是退了又订了一个商务行政套间。套间还不错，房间大，设施还总凑合，但价格偏贵。总体感觉一般。,"I started to book a big room, but I went to the hotel and told me that I did n’t book it. I just had to call to ask and told me that there was one.Go to see, the room is too small, and it is too small to put a bed.So he retired and ordered a business administrative suite.The suite is not bad, the room is large, the facilities are always made up, but the price is expensive.Overall feel average."
1,服务态度不错房间隔音效果有点差早餐太差了,The service attitude is good. The sound insulation effect of the room is a bit bad for breakfast.
1,"房间还是可以的,但是温泉的团队客人实在太多,跟每个池子都象下馄饨,吵吵闹闹,不象在享受了.下午去问:人多,晚上去还是人多,第二天一开门就去,人很少,半小时后,不得了,象老式公共浴室,人满为患,团队的大巴士来了!!!","When you open the door, there are very few people. After half an hour, it is incredible. It is like an old -fashioned public bathroom. People are overcrowded. The team of the team is here !!!"
1,到前台发现酒店的广告是数码房间，原来我们订的房间有IPTV，有电脑，有VOD，所以很骄傲的说是数码房间，觉得好玩。服务态度好，但却一问三不知，没有宵夜，却有中药泡脚的骚扰电话。总体还是满意的。,"When I went to the front desk, I found that the hotel's advertisement was a digital room. It turned out that the room we ordered was IPTV, computers, and VOD, so it was proud to say that it was a digital room and felt fun.The service attitude is good, but I do n’t know if I do n’t know. There is no supper, but there are harassment calls of traditional Chinese medicine.Overall is still satisfied."

1,我和老公定的是海景房，感觉非常舒适。完全的私密空间，窗外就是景观和海景。房间干净明亮，两张大床完全能满足一家人的需要。就是衣服不太好晾晒，卫生间没有通风的设施。其他都很好给5分不为过,"My husband and I are determined to be a sea -view room, and I feel very comfortable.Complete private space, the window is the landscape and sea view.The room is clean and bright, and the two large beds can fully meet the needs of the family.That is, the clothes are not easy to dry, and there are no ventilation facilities in the bathroom.Others are very good to give 5 points."
1,"比较老的饭店了,房间只能用还比较干净整洁来形容,但离五星有点差距.卫生间也很小.东西比较旧.","The older restaurants are described as clean and tidy, but there is a gap between the five stars. The bathroom is also very small. The things are older."
0,"3月28日和3月29日在此住宿两晚，118每晚，酒店的房间装修比较差，门松松垮垮，不可反锁（靠一个防全开的别扣），卫生间的浴室部分就是一个铅管垂下头，28日晚上抵达太晚了没有洗漱，29日发现没有热水，向服务员反应后，她的第一反应是：“你把冷热水方向搞反了”，我在此住了2晚居然连冷热水都分不清？然后是：“你要多放一会”她自己放了，也是温的不足以洗浴。鉴于在西宁一天快捷的经验，我请她跟锅炉房说一声把水温提到一点，她说：“我们的师傅都是专业的，知道该做什么”。放了半个小时还是没有热水后，我们决定按照其它前面的网友提示的去旁边的“新华宾馆”（新华书店边），装修比这家好太多，才100一夜。总结：设施差一点没问题，但是服务员一开口就是顾客的错，顾客不够专业，顾客什么都不知道，我们就这样住不住无所谓。所以打1分。宾馆反馈2008年4月24日：首先感谢贵宾客对我宾馆提出宝贵的意见，我们在看到你的意见后非常重视，也立即做了改进。客房磁卡锁自带反锁，安全上请宾客绝对放心，本宾馆素以安全著称,24小时有保安人员、服务人员值班，各楼道有公共区域有闭路监控,宾馆执行军事化管理。北楼部分房间只有沐浴，如果需要盆浴，可以要求我们的工作人员换房间，或者在预订单中注明要带盆浴的房间。由于我们房间数量较多，锅炉房距离少数房间有点远，输水管道也相应较长，因此这些房间需要将管道中的冷水放完才会有热水,本宾馆的热水都是保证最低水温不能低于75度才能向客房输送，但对于这种情况可能是我们的工作人员没有向贵宾客解释清楚，并且在语气上也有不足之处，在此宾馆向贵宾客深表歉意。宾馆已对此事作出严肃处理。这种情况我宾馆一定杜绝再次发生。希望您能下次入住我们酒店时，我们能给你更好的服务，以后还多对宾馆提出宝贵建议，拉萨广场饭店全体员工真诚欢迎您。再次非常感谢您对我宾馆作出的点评。","Stay here for two nights on March 28 and March 29. At 118, every night, the hotel's room decoration is poor, the door is loose, and the door cannot be locked (relying on a full -fledged deduction).Slow down, I arrived too late on the evening of the 28th and did not wash. On the 29th, I found that there was no hot water. After responding to the waiter, her first reaction was: ""You reverse the direction of the hot and cold water.""Can't even distinguish hot and cold water in the evening?Then: ""You have to put it for a while"" she put it herself, it is not enough to take a bath.In view of the fast experience in Xining, I asked her to talk to the boiler room to mention the water temperature. She said, ""Our masters are professional and know what to do.""After putting it for half an hour, there was no hot water, we decided to go to the ""Xinhua Hotel"" (next to Xinhua Bookstore) according to other netizens in front of the netizens in front. The decoration is much better than this one, only 100 nights.Summary: The facilities are almost okay, but the waiter's mouth is the customer's fault, the customer is not professional enough, and the customer knows nothing. It doesn't matter if we can't live like this.So make 1 point.Hotel feedback on April 24, 2008: First of all, thanks to the VIPs for putting forward valuable opinions on our hotel. We attached great importance to your opinion and immediately improved.The magnetic card lock of the guest room is self -locking, and the guests are absolutely assured in terms of safety. The hotel is known for its safety. It is duty with security personnel and service personnel in 24 hours. There are closed -circuit monitoring in public areas in public areas.Some rooms in the North Building are only bathing. If you need to take a bath, we can ask our staff to change the room, or indicate the room where the bath is should be brought to the pot.Due to the large number of rooms, the boiler room is a bit far away from a few rooms, and the water transmission pipeline is correspondingly. Therefore, the cold water in these rooms needs to be put in the pipeline.It cannot be transported to the guest rooms below 75 degrees, but this situation may not be explained to the VIPs, and there are also deficiencies in the tone. At this hotel, we apologize to the VIPs.The hotel has dealt with this matter seriously.In this case, our hotel must prevent it again.I hope that when you can stay in our hotel next time, we can give you better services. In the future, we will make precious suggestions for the hotel. All employees of Lhasa Plaza Hotels welcome you sincerely.Thank you again for your reviews of my hotel."
1,入住的是标准房.设施比较新.房间大.餐厅出品质量比较好.价格公道.需要改善的是浴室的淋浴帘不够长.水很容易流到外面.另外从客房到温泉有一段距离.去的时候有车送.回来的时候没有车.只能自己走回来.下雨的时候会比较狼狈.温泉区比较大而全面.总的来说挺值得!,"The standard room is in the standard room. The facilities are relatively new. The room is large. The quality of the restaurant is better. The price is fair. What needs to be improved is that the shower curtain in the bathroom is not long enough.There are cars to send. When you come back, you do n’t have a car. You can only come back by yourself. It will be more embarrassed when it rains. The hot spring area is relatively large and comprehensive. In general, it is worth it!"
0,房间和走廊里味道很重，楼外下面马路上的声音很吵，早上隔壁的电视机的声音听的很清楚，可以当闹钟使用，但时间是隔壁定的，没有给“闹钟”定时，结帐的时候发票没有给我盖章，总的感觉是让人失望。今后不会再住了。,"The room and the corridor taste are very heavy. The sound on the road below the outside of the building is very noisy.The invoice did not stamp the invoice during the account, the general feeling was disappointing.I won't live anymore in the future."
1,"整体尚可.优点很多就不说了.单就缺点罗列如下,望改进:1,房内夜间有异响.象是水滴或是气流的声音.2,宽带要服务台开通才可使用.开始不明白,耽误了好多事.3,被子感觉很不好,不透气,象一层塑料罩着一样,很难受(个人感受).4,落地灯插座没电.只好趴在桌下找桌后的插座.5,卫生间隔音不是一般的差.","The overall is still available. There are many advantages. The disadvantages are listed as follows, and I hope to improve: 1, there is abnormal noise at night in the room.I do n’t understand, I have delayed a lot of things .3, the quilt feels very bad, it is not breathable, like a layer of plastic cover, it is uncomfortable (personal feelings) .4, the floor lamp socket was not powerless. I had to lie on the table and find the table behind the table.Socket .5, bathroom sound insulation is not a general difference."
1,酒店周边环境很好，主楼房间比较旧，床还是比较舒服的。但交通不太方便，需要走出去坐车。,"The environment around the hotel is very good, the main building room is old, and the bed is still more comfortable.But traffic is not convenient, you need to go out and take a car."
0,"房间环境尚可,卫生让人担忧,床单圬迹斑斑!有骚扰电话补充点评2008年4月6日：停车场没有灯,还污水满地留,建议取消该店","The room environment is still acceptable, hygiene is worrying, bed sheets are spoken! There are harassing calls to replenish April 6, 2008: There are no lights in the parking lot, and sewage is left full. It is recommended to cancel the store."
1,"酒店不错,离我要公干的地方很近.房间设施很好,服务也很好,物有所值.","The hotel is good, it is very close to the place where I want to do it. The room facilities are very good, the service is also good, and it is worth it."
1,酒店的地理位置距离地铁很近，从火车站出来较为方便，入住的当天因为我们定的普通房间满了，所以免费升级到了高级客房，室内配电脑的那种，可以免费上网。不过楼下的茶餐厅的服务差了点，见到外地人就不让点花茶（2元），一定要点其它的茶水（8元）。,"The geographical location of the hotel is very close to the subway. It is more convenient to come out from the train station. On the day of staying, because our ordinary room was full, it was upgraded to high -end rooms for free. The kind of indoor computer can access the Internet for free.However, the service of the tea restaurant downstairs is a bit worse. When you see the foreigners, you will not let the tea (2 yuan), and you must order other tea (8 yuan)."
1,外观看起来不是很起眼，房间不是很大，但是很干净，服务也不错，早餐也很丰富，比较喜欢。,"The appearance does not look very eye -catching, the room is not very large, but it is clean, the service is good, the breakfast is also very rich, and I like it."
0,早餐很差，check-in服务也差，我预定的无烟大床，结果进房间发现是2张床的房间，要他们换，发现是大床没错，但是是吸烟房间，唉，将就了。后来发现床垫上放屁股处有一个大大的凹陷，绝对是劣质货。,"The breakfast is poor, the check-in service is also poor, I booked a large smoke-free bed, but I found that there are 2 beds in the room. It is right to change the room.It's right.Later, I found that there was a large depression on the buttocks on the mattress, which was definitely inferior."
1,酒店的位置和服务都不错，但房间设施比较陈旧，离九州港很近，交通方便。适合一家人度假时入住。,"The location and service of the hotel are good, but the room facilities are relatively old, very close to Kyushu Port, and convenient transportation.Suitable for a family to check in during vacation."
0,"原来在网上订了6月4、5日两天的标准大床房，后来由于误机加上上海交通堵塞，导致到达酒店时间快到18：30了。酒店前台说我的预订已经给取消，让我打电话找携程。于是致电携程，携程的人让我将电话给前台服务员，最后告诉我的结果是我订的房间已经没有了，原因是我在网上订单的保留时间最晚是17：30，问我是否要加钱升级房间。当时很生气，酒店前台一开始直接跟我说预订的房型没有就完了，搞出这么多后面的事情（请继续往下看），而且酒店前台的服务态度也很不好。其实也不是第一次住这个酒店了，只是由于它离上海的分公司很近才选择这那的。之前也试过晚上很晚才到达酒店，预订的房型也是没有了，酒店还免费给我升级了房间。所以以上事件可能只是个别事件，并不代表酒店整体水平。更另我气愤的是携程当时给我的建议是加钱升级房间或者换酒店，我当时问携程为什么不用短信通知我订单已经给取消，得到的回答是客人不喜欢收到这样的短信。我当时毫不犹豫的拒绝了携程的建议。后来不知道是不是太太打电话去投诉了（这次订单是太太帮忙订的），携程发短信给我说我订的房型又有了（不知道是之前没有查清楚？还是查了我过往的交易记录发现还过得去？），当然我是不会回去住了，酒店也一早通过其他渠道落实好了。最后结论是，这个酒店是不会再去去了，携程也不一定再会用了。注：以上说明都是中肯的事实描述，不带任何感情色彩。宾馆反馈2008年6月13日：首先对当日因满房给客人造成的不变表示遗憾,以后我们争取做到尽量安排超时客人入住本酒店,并对因超时取消房间的客人,再次入住免费升级.我们争取在硬件设施上有所改善,并加强培训,保证高质量的服务.","It turned out that the standard large bed rooms on June 4 and 5 were booked online. Later, due to the accidental machine plus Shanghai traffic jams, the time for the arrival hotel was almost 18:30.The front desk of the hotel said that my booking has been canceled, and let me call to find Ctrip.So call Ctrip. The people of Ctrip asked me to call the front desk waiter. Finally, the result I told me was that the room I ordered was gone. The reason was that the reserved time for the online order was 17:30. Ask me if I want to add it to add.Money upgrade the room.At that time, I was very angry. At first, the hotel's front desk told me that the book type I booked was not over. I did so much about it (please continue to look down), and the service attitude of the hotel's front desk was also very bad.In fact, it is not the first time to stay in this hotel, only because it is close to the branch of Shanghai, I chose this.I also tried to arrive at the hotel after late, and the book type was gone. The hotel also upgraded the room for free.Therefore, the above incident may be just an individual event, which does not mean the overall level of the hotel.What's more angry is that Ctrip's suggestion at the time was to increase money to upgrade the room or change the hotel. At that time, I asked Ctrip why I did not use SMS to inform me that the order had been canceled. The answer was that the guest did not like to receive such text messages.I did not hesitate to refuse the suggestion of Ctrip.Later, I did n’t know if my wife called to complain (this order was made by the wife's help), and Ctrip sent me a text message to tell me that the room type I ordered was there again (I don’t know if I didn’t find out before? Or I checked my past.The transaction records have been found?) Of course, I won't go back to live, and the hotel has been implemented through other channels in the morning.The final conclusion is that this hotel will not go anymore, and Ctrip may not necessarily use it anymore.Note: The above descriptions are all described in Zhongyan, without any emotional colors.Hotel feedback on June 13, 2008: First of all, it regrets the constant regimen of the guests caused by the full house that day. In the future, we strive to arrange the timeout guests to stay at the hotel, and check the free upgrade to the guests who cancel the room due to overtime.. We strive to improve the hardware facilities and strengthen training to ensure high -quality services."
1,酒店位于市中心，非常方便。虽然没有时间去看，但听说附近也有很多景点。总体来讲，酒店的服务还是非常不错，但房间比较小，而且应该是两个房间封门而成为的单独小间，硬件上感觉达不到5星级的标准。三楼的法式餐厅不错。,"The hotel is located in the city center, which is very convenient.Although there is no time to see, I heard that there are many attractions nearby.Generally speaking, the hotel's service is still very good, but the room is relatively small, and it should be a separate room that is closed by the two rooms. The hardware feels less than a 5 -star standard.The French restaurant on the third floor is good."
0,以前去香港都是住在尖沙咀的“九龙酒店”，印象十分好，除了房间小一些，交通是真的很方便！尖沙咀地铁站出来就是。这次去香港想着换一个地区酒店住住，因为比较喜欢SOGO，就想选择铜锣湾这一带的酒店。在携程上查看了大家的评价，又因为定的时候比较仓促，看重的“海景酒店”没有了，就选择了“港岛皇悦”。事实证明，这个酒店只要加钱一百多，是真的不行啊！一分价钱一分货~~~~checkin的时候，前台态度不好又动作慢，一开始只肯给大床房，因为我和我妈睡眠不好，就执意要标房，于是给了16层最里间的一个房间（1601），这个房间卫生间很有问题，花洒和台盆的下水道是坏的！花洒的问题是支架由于使用年代长久的问题已经松了，只要一放上去，花洒就会掉下来，所以洗澡的时候只能一个手拿着洗澡！而台盆的下水道塞子是不能人为控制的，只要一塞住就拿不出来，只能用小刀撬出来，我的一柄小水果刀也因此弄坏。要求换房，被告知没有标间，只有大床房，也不知是真是假；报维修也说一天两天修不好，只好做罢，将就使用。再来说说它的交通，离地铁站不近也不远，走走么6、7分钟，早上出门还精神抖擞，走走没问题，晚上回家逛得双脚酸痛，可就走不动了，想想还是尖沙咀九龙酒店好，地铁上面就是酒店。还有一点，就是到SOGO的距离，携程上写明是0.5公里，那天我和我妈愣是走了25分钟，半当中还吃不消在许留山歇了一歇，不然真不行了。最后再说说酒店的环境，网友们都评价这家酒店晚上很吵，一定要住高层，本来我看自己住16层，心想应该不要紧，谁知晚上还是吵，这是因为酒店门口的一条街到了晚上也算是酒吧一条街，还不是正宗的那些，隔几步就看到打扮“坦荡”的女人坐在酒吧门口，那些酒吧都有厚实的门帘，一直要吵到凌晨才会安静！虽然对这个酒店有诸多不满，但是它也有一个亮点，也要表扬一下：机场快线的免费穿梭巴士H1有一个站点就在“港岛皇悦”，所以来、去都很方便，等于下了机场快线就有专车直送。下次再去香港的话，我想我不会再挑选这个酒店了。,"In the past, I went to Hong Kong to live in the ""Kowloon Hotel"" who lived in Tsim Sha Tsui. I was very impressed. Except for the smaller room, transportation is really convenient!The Tsim Sha Tsui subway station comes out.This time I went to Hong Kong to stay in a region hotel, because I prefer SOGO, I want to choose a hotel in Causeway Bay.I checked everyone's evaluation on Ctrip, and because it was relatively hasty, the ""Sea View Hotel"" was gone, so I chose ""Hong Kong Island Huangyue"".It turns out that as long as this hotel has more than a hundred money, it is really not possible!When the price is price and one point ~~~~ Checkin, the attitude of the front desk is not good and the movement is slow. At first, I was willing to give the big bed room. Because my mother and I were not sleeping well, I insisted on the benchmarking room.A room in the innermost part of the floor (1601). The bathroom of this room is very problematic. The sewer of the shower and the basin is bad!The problem of shower is that the bracket has been loosened due to the long -term problem of use. As soon as it is put, the shower will fall down, so you can only take a bath with one hand when you take a bath!The sewer plug of the basin cannot be artificially controlled. As long as it is stuffed, it can't be taken out. I can only pry out with a knife. A small fruit knife is damaged.The request to change the house, the argument that there is no standard room, there is only a large bed room, and I do n’t know if it is true or false. It is true or false. It is also said that it is not good to repair a day and two days. You have to do it and use it.Let's talk about its transportation, not far from the subway station and not far away. Walk around for 6 or 7 minutes. When you go out in the morning, you are still energetic. There is no problem walking. When you go home at night, you can go home and sore your feet, but you ca n’t move.It is good to think about it, the Jiulong Hotel in Tsim Sha Tsui is good, and the hotel is on the subway.Another point is that at the distance of SOGO, Ctrip stated that it was 0.5 kilometers. On that day, my mother and I had gone for 25 minutes. In half, I couldn't eat it in Xu Liushan.Finally, let ’s talk about the environment of the hotel. Netizens have evaluated this hotel very noisy at night. I must live in the high -rise. I originally saw that I lived in the 16th floor. I thought it should not be tight.At night, it can be regarded as a bar of the bar, and it is not authentic. Seeing a ""frank"" woman in the bar at the door of the bar, those bars have thick curtains, and they will not be quiet until the early morning!Although there are many dissatisfaction with this hotel, it also has a highlight. It is also necessary to praise: There is a site on the free shuttle bus H1 at the airport express line.There will be direct delivery of the airport express line.Next time I go to Hong Kong, I don't think I will choose this hotel anymore."
1,看了之前的评论才选定的烟台中心大酒店。感觉服务很贴心，管理到位。补充点评2008年7月17日：我给的分好像低了，4.5才公平。,"After reading the previous comment, the Yantai Center Hotel was selected.I feel that the service is intimate and in place.Supplementary comment on July 17, 2008: The score I gave seems to be low, 4.5 is fair."
0,酒店服务态度极差，设施很差，建议还是不要到那儿去。,The hotel service attitude is very poor and the facilities are poor. It is recommended not to go there.
0,这个房间的性价比真是太差劲了，这个价格在西安可以住四星酒店了！房间（305）浴室的下水道是堵的，洗完一个人至少要半小时后才能洗第二人，房间的隔音几乎是没有的。这样的房间简直不能忍受！但据说是他们最好的宾馆了？？？,The price / performance ratio of this room is really bad. This price can stay in the four -star hotel in Xi'an!The sewer of the room (305) bathroom is blocked. It takes at least half an hour to wash a person to wash the second person after washing. The sound insulation in the room is almost not available.Such a room is almost unbearable!But it is said that it is their best hotel?IntersectionIntersection
1,海景套间很不错，离海很近。服务也很好，就是卫生间的地砖是不防滑的，地上有水就要小心滑倒了。,"The sea view is very good, and it is very close to the sea.The service is also very good, that is, the floor tiles in the bathroom are not non -slip. Be careful to slide down if there is water on the ground."
1,"我是10月20日一家人入住的,北京五日游,从门童,柜台接待,餐厅服务,卫生,都比较温馨,热情,礼貌,给人一种宾至如归之感.入住,结帐都很及时,速度很快.到北京各景点交通很方便.周围的景点步行10分钟到达的有梅","I stayed in the family on October 20th, Beijing Five -Day Tour, from the door children, counter reception, restaurant service, hygiene, warm, enthusiastic, polite, giving people a sense of returning.Timely, fast speed. Traffic in various attractions in Beijing is very convenient. The surrounding attractions walk 10 minutes to reach Youmei"
1,非常非常的不错，第一次住如家，订的是套房，确实非常非常的不错，感觉不次于今天住的北京森根（4星），如家的感觉确实是挺温馨的，虽然不如5星的豪华高贵，但是如果家庭旅游落脚的话，如家确实是很好的选择，谢谢如家！,"Very, very good. For the first time, I lived in the home. I ordered a suite. It is really very good. It feels not as good as the Beijing Sengen (4 stars) I live in today.Luxury and noble, but if the family travels, Rujia is indeed a good choice, thank you home!"
1,"没有桑拿设备,理由是正在维修,但真正的原因是不赚钱.","There is no sauna device, the reason is to be repaired, but the real reason is that they do not make money."
1,这是一家古色古香的酒店，挺有特色的，尤其是回廊里的鱼很多，孩子喜欢，酒店本周的环境很好，服务也不错。只是离碧海金沙远了点。,"This is a antique hotel, which is very distinctive, especially in the corridor, children like it, the hotel's environment is good this week, and the service is good.It's just a little far from the Bishi Jinsha."
1,吸取网友们的经验，我们预定的是度假区高层海景大床房，于6月21-23日入住。很高兴亚太的服务还不错，完全按照我们的要求安排了房间。服务员在走廊里遇到客人也会问好；晚上在酒店吃烧烤，服务也不错。总的来说，酒店的环境和海滨浴场都不错，泳池造型很美，水也清澈，晚上水池的灯光也很漂亮，可能是淡季的原因，海滨浴场人很少，特别安静，适合度假。美中不足是房间的设施比较陈旧，电视太小，风扇和空调都有噪音，电话机也很老旧，拖鞋看起来不太干净，好在我们自带了拖鞋。再有就是早餐要提出批评，虽然种类很多，但味道实在不敢恭维，作为一个老五星酒店，房间设施陈旧可以理解，更新起来成本过高，但早餐质量应该尽快改进，这样才能与星级相配。另外，北京的五星酒店都会在入住的第一天送水果，甚至蜈支洲岛上的观海木楼都送了水果，可惜亚太却没有，这也是对客人表示欢迎的一种服务吧，建议亚太考虑一下。总的来说，酒店还是很舒服，给我们留下了比较好的印象。,"To learn the experience of netizens, we scheduled the high-rise seascape bed rooms of the resort, staying on June 21-23.I am very happy that the Asia -Pacific service is not bad, and the room is arranged completely in accordance with our requirements.The waiter will ask guests in the corridor; at night, eating barbecue at the hotel at night, the service is also good.In general, the hotel's environment and seaside bath are good. The swimming pool is beautiful, the water is clear, and the lights in the pool at night are also very beautiful. It may be the reason for the off -season. There are very few people in the seaside bath. It is particularly quiet and suitable for vacation.The inadequate in the United States is that the facilities in the room are relatively old, the TV is too small, the fan and the air conditioner are noisy, the telephone is very old, the slippers look not clean, but we bring our own slippers.Then there is a criticism of breakfast. Although there are many types, the taste is really not complimented. As an old five -star hotel, the room facilities are obvious. The update cost is too high, but the quality of breakfast should be improved as soon as possible so that it can be matched with the star grade.EssenceIn addition, the five -star hotel in Beijing will send fruits on the first day of staying, and even the watching sea and wooden buildings on Wuzhizhou Island have given fruits. Unfortunately, the Asia Pacific does not have it. This is also a service that welcomes guests.Asia Pacific considers.In general, the hotel is still very comfortable, leaving us a better impression."
1,酒店很不错！大堂气派宽敞，房间挺大。服务一般，再也不是没普间升豪间了，我早上去得早只能等别人退房。普间没早餐。桑拿按摩VIP还可以，服务不想有些地方只想着快点结束，快点付钱，朋友说物有所值。,The hotel is very good!The lobby is spacious and the room is quite large.The service is average. It is no longer there is no universal Sheng Hao. I can only wait for someone else to check out early in the morning.No breakfast.Saunader VIP is okay. The service does not want some places to just want to end quickly and pay quickly. Friends say that things are worth it.
1,1）设施比较简陋2）早餐还算可以3）离市中心比较远,1) The facilities are relatively simple. 2) Breakfast is still 3) Farther from the city center
1,"由于航班延误,我们错过了机场快线到酒店的穿梭巴士,因此走路冤枉路.从地图上看酒店应该距离湾仔比铜锣湾更近,因此坐地铁从湾仔上来了.其实过了几天才知道酒店其实距离铜锣湾的时代广场特别近,走路过去最多十分钟.走过去的话路上还路过很多香港的好去处--一个潮州餐厅,那家餐厅的大厨是07年的金奖大厨,好吃!不贵!酒店门口有一个隧道--其实哪个隧道就是北京的地下通道.酒店的饮食跟周边的饮食相比差距很大,地下通道上来就有一个海鲜自助火锅,明星常去的,价格78港币一位.走路3分钟就能到.前面很多评论肯定都是白领多事女,走两步路都叫苦的其实每天都挤公交舍不得打车的主儿.特别建议大家步行去时代广场,等酒店班车实在是浪费时间.多研究一下地图就行了,香港的地图普遍没有比例尺,实际距离没有地图表示的那么远.酒店的空调特别猛,香港所有的室内都是18度的设计.区分是不是本地人的标志:男人看手表--港人多为名贵金表,外地人含外国人多为杂牌子电子表;女人看外套--港人多穿长袖或短袖+披肩,外地人含外国人多是短袖!太冷,男人都觉得冷.每天晚上关闭室内空调送风(一样冷),盖羽绒被入睡.特别舒服!酒店上网很便宜,单人间的网吧,高速宽带30港币/小时,用上网记账卡,可以每次用每次登录不会浪费金钱.应该办理一个香港本地的电话卡,在7-11就能买到,50元的就够了,88元的用不了.因为他们的移动电话卡打内地\美国\加拿大\新加坡等地都是免长途费的,只有本地花费.我一周打了两块电池都没打完30块钱!下次去香港还能用.酒店房间小,但是设备齐全.包括女人用的卸妆棉都有.只有淋浴而且很小.服务很好无需小费,服务员都很热情.为了避免浪费,没有特殊情况的话没有使用完的东西不会更新.如需更新随时可以.可能让一些喜欢每天留存酒店肥皂的朋友有些不便.酒店超时退房每小时110港币,比较合理.而且酒店退房速度超快,还可以预订去机场的专车比地铁方便运送行李,比出租车合算.本人退房的当天赶上台风了,无奈只能乘坐出租,从酒店到机场300港币+过路费40港币+行李放入后备箱20港币=360港币,还可以.这家酒店叫做丽都,他隔壁还有一家酒店叫做丽悦,同属一个集团距离20米.价格有一定优惠,如果对价格敏感的话可以选择丽悦,其实入住质量是一样的.补充点评2008年8月14日：酒店附近有一家小超市,就在去时代广场的路上.临近中石化加油站.1公升装的酸梅汤19港币/瓶,一次买2个19.5港币!超值!比酒店的矿泉水好喝多了.","Due to the delays of the flight, we missed the shuttle bus from the airport express line to the hotel, so walking is wrong. From the map, the hotel should be closer to Wan Chai than Causeway Bay, so I took the subway from Wan Chai.In fact, it is very close to the Times Square of Causeway Bay. It has been walking for a maximum of ten minutes. If you walk over, there are many good places in Hong Kong on the way-a Chaozhou restaurant. The chef of that restaurant is the golden prize chef in 2007, delicious! NoWe are expensive! There is a tunnel at the entrance of the hotel-which tunnel is in Beijing's underground passage. The hotel's diet is very different from the surrounding diet. There is a seafood buffet hotpot on the underground passage.Picks. You can get to you in 3 minutes. Many of the previous comments are definitely white -collar workers and women. In two steps, they are bitter.It is a waste of time. Just study more maps. Hong Kong's maps generally have no ratio. The actual distance is not as far as representative of the map.Logo: Men look at watches-Hong Kong people are mostly precious gold watches, and foreigners include foreigners as miscellaneous brands; women look at jackets-Hong Kong people wear long-sleeved or short-sleeved+shawls. Foreigners include foreignersIt is short -sleeved! Too cold, men feel cold. Turn off the indoor air -conditioning air supply (cold) every night, cover the down and fall asleep. It is very comfortable! The hotel is very cheap on the Internet.The Internet accounting card, you can use each login every time you will not waste money. You should apply for a local telephone card in Hong Kong. You can buy it at 7-11.The mobile phone card is free of long -distance expenses in the Mainland \ United States \ Canada \ Singapore and other places. Only the local cost. I did n’t finish 30 yuan a week! I can still use it to Hong Kong next time. The hotel room is small,However, the equipment is complete. Including the cotton removal pads used by women. Only the shower and very small. The service is very good. The waiter is very enthusiastic. In order to avoid waste, there are no special cases.It is okay at any time. It may make some friends who like to stay in the hotel soap every day. It ’s inconvenient. The hotel checks out at 110 Hong Kong dollars per hour, which is more reasonable. And the hotel's check -out speed is super fast, you can also book a special car to the airport.Calculate the taxi. On the day of my check -up, I caught up with the typhoon. I could only take the rental. From the hotel to the airport to the airport, 300 Hong Kong dollars+the toll 40 Hong Kong dollars+the luggage put in the trunk 20 HK $ 20 = 360 Hong Kong dollars, and this hotel is called it is calledLidu, there is also a hotel next door called Liyue, which belongs to the same group of 20 meters. The price has a certain discount. If you are sensitive to the price, you can choose Liyue. In fact, the quality of the check -in is the same.: There is a small supermarket near the hotel, just on the way to Times Square.Sour plum soup 19 Hong Kong dollars/bottle, buy 2 19.5 Hong Kong dollars at a time! Value! It is better than the hotel's mineral water."
1,"环境还是不错的,但是洗手间实在是太小了,而且也没有送雪碧或可乐,本来说通过携程订房是有送的,不知为什么没有送,早餐一般,68元不值这个价宾馆反馈2008年8月6日：感谢您选择并入住苏州人家,您提的宝贵意见,酒店管理层会及时采纳,并对工作中的遗漏事项加以分析整改,同时我们也期盼您的下次光临!","The environment is still good, but the toilet is too small, and it is not sent to Sprite or Cola. Originally, it was sent through Ctrip's booking.January 6th: Thank you for choosing and staying in Suzhou people. The valuable opinions you mentioned, the hotel management will adopt it in time, and analyze and rectify the omissions at work. At the same time, we also look forward to your next visit!"
1,听朋友介绍不错，因此出差选择了此酒店，一进酒店感觉院子很大、绿化很好，在大热天看着很舒服，停车场很大也很安全，对自驾游的朋友很合适，酒店大堂布置很古朴，透过大堂落地玻璃能看到外面庭院的风景，很雅致，就是大堂有点矮，房间很安静、干净，还有人性化的一键通服务，很方便，服务员也很有礼貌，看到客人会主动打招呼，总台的业务操作很熟练。就是不知怎么回事卫生间的门有点掉颜色，提醒要入住南林的朋友洗澡时不要把自己的衣服挂在门后，出门不远就是网师园、沧浪亭，在古城区该酒店房价也算不贵的，大致不错，值得推荐。,"I listened to my friends well, so I chose this hotel on a business trip. As soon as I entered the hotel, I felt that the yard was very large and the greening was very good. It was very comfortable to watch on the hot day. The parking lot was very large and safe.The layout is very simple. You can see the scenery of the outside courtyard through the glass floor glass. It is very elegant. The lobby is a bit short, the room is very quiet and clean, and the humanized one -click service.Seeing that the guests would say hello, the business operation of the main station was very skilled.I just do n’t know what to do with the door of the bathroom is a bit colorful. I remind friends who stay in Nanlin when taking a bath and do n’t hang their clothes behind the door.Not expensive, roughly good, worth recommending."
1,"酒店房间还是不错的,国庆节去房价上涨,如果平时去160元的话性价比还是很高的,离市中心远了点,打个的5元就到了,市中心其实也没什么,就人多点!","The hotel room is still good. The price of houses to go to the National Day is rising. If you usually go to 160 yuan, the price / performance ratio is still very high. It is a little far from the city center. It will be 5 yuan. In the city center, there is nothing, so there are more people!"
1,一如既往的支持，不错的酒店，服务上再上去一点就好了。宾馆反馈2008年7月31日：谢谢您长期以来对我酒店的关心和支持，我酒店即将申报四星级酒店，我们在硬件的改造的同时，软件服务上也加强和提升，争取让每一位宾客都满意。我酒店按五星级标准装修的24-26楼高层观景客房即将竣工，期待您的光临！！,"As always support, good hotels, just go up a little more.Hotel feedback on July 31, 2008: Thank you for your long -term care and support for our hotel.

Looking forward to your visit!Intersection"
1,除了没有浴缸和保险柜其他都很好，干净，安静，服务，对面就是海鲜大排档我们6人吃了330,"Except that there are no bathtubs and safe, everything is good, clean, quiet, service, opposite is the seafood stall we eat 330"
1,前台服务很不好，位置还算可以，房间感觉没好干净，早餐品种太少。哈哈，可贵的是，还用的是飘柔和舒服佳。,"The front desk service is not good, the location is okay, the room feels not good, and there are too few breakfast varieties.Haha, the precious thing is that it also uses fluttering soft and comfortable."
1,同样价格的行政楼层房间有大有小，需要注意。洗手间装修布置的很舒适漂亮，有淋浴和浴缸，还有透光窗子。房间内部还算比较大，服务比较好！总体感觉还是不错的。在这里住宿的老外很多。,"There are big and small administrative floor rooms at the same price, and you need to pay attention.The decoration of the toilet is very comfortable and beautiful, with shower and bathtubs, and light -transmitting windows.The interior of the room is relatively large, and the service is better!Overall feels good.There are many foreigners who stay here."
0,"个人感觉：1、条件差，房间小。2、服务不到位。钥匙老是需要到大堂刷卡。3、楼下是KTV,很吵。总体感觉：便宜没好货。边上的星宇大酒店真的是物超所值。","Personal feelings: 1. Poor conditions, small rooms.2. The service is not in place.The key always needs to go to the lobby card.3. The downstairs is KTV, very noisy.Overall feeling: cheap is not good.The star hotel on the side is really worthwhile."
1,服务还可以，只是晚上没有机场接送车，不太方便，蛮难找的。,"The service is okay, but there is no airport pick -up car at night. It is not convenient and difficult to find."
1,酒店比较老，但是房间还好。酒店虽不在市中心，但离我出差的公司较近，所以住过几次。,"The hotel is older, but the room is okay.Although the hotel is not in the center of the city, it is closer to the company that is on a business trip, so I have lived a few times."
1,"该酒店住宿环境一般,房间装修一般,交通应该还是很方便吧宾馆反馈2008年1月2日：感谢您的入住及点评！我们还有06年新装的特色标准间，房间状态基本为四星级标准，欢迎您再次试住！","The hotel's accommodation environment is average, the room decoration is average, and the transportation should be very convenient.We also have the special standard rooms in 2006. The state of the room is basically a four -star standard. Welcome to try it again!"
1,"第一晚本来预定了喜来登,结果朋友说还是要去天堂住一下,经不住她的劝说我们就去了,谁知这只是恶梦的开始.房间烟味很重不说,空调的声音还吵的不行,跟服务员说换房,结果等了半天终于给我们换了一间看上去还不错的山景房,谁想到到了半夜马桶开始漏水,而且有高原反应,根本没法睡觉.第二晚我还是通过携程订了沟口的喜来登,一进大堂,就给人很温馨的感觉.房间也很舒适干净,服务员态度很好,且总是面带微笑.自助形式的早餐很丰富,晚上用了酒店的野菌火锅那个鲜啊~~~!!!而且168每位的价格也很公道.晚上服务员向我推荐了酒店的藏羌风情歌舞晚会,并告知我还可与奥运冠军同台游戏.幸运的我们还与高敏,王军霞和影,晚上又有篝火晚会及烟花汇演,我朋友乐的和不拢嘴.喜来登真不错,下次若是去九寨,还会选择九寨沟喜来登大酒店.宾馆反馈2008年7月24日：感谢您的点评,我们期待您的下次光临,为您提供更加优质的服务.","On the first night, I had to book Xilain. As a result, my friend said that he still wanted to live in heaven. We couldn't stand the persuasion of her. Who knew that this was just the beginning of a nightmare.Noisy, I told the waiter to change the house. As a result, I waited for a long time and finally changed us a mountain view room that looked pretty good.In the evening, I still booked a ditch from Ctrip. As soon as I entered the lobby, I felt a very warm feeling. The room was also very comfortable and clean, the waiter attitude was good, and always smiled. The breakfast in the form of self -service was rich.The hotel's wild fungus hot pot is fresh ~~~ !!! The price of each person in 168 is also fair. In the evening, the waiter recommended the hotel's Tibetan style song and dance party to me, and told me that I could also be on the same stage as the Olympic champion.Game. Fortunately, we are also with Gao Min, Wang Junxia and Ying, and a bonfire party and fireworks show at night. My friend is happy. Sheraton is really good. If you go to Jiuzhai next time, you will also choose Jiuzhaigou Xilandeng Hotel. Hotel Hotel.Feedback July 24, 2008: Thank you for your comments. We look forward to your next visit to provide you with better services."
1,比较满意的就是有去机场的大巴，比较方便。其他的也差不多。补充点评2008年7月10日：上网速度真的是暴快的。另外专门送了水果过来，服务不错。,"What is more satisfied is the bus to go to the airport, which is more convenient.Others are almost the same.Supplementary comment on July 10, 2008: The speed of Internet access is really crazy.In addition, the fruit is specially sent, and the service is good."
1,2006年6月2日时曾住过这家酒店，晶丽的服务仍然很不错，结帐时给客人的信任非常难得，不象绝大多数酒店那样问了是否使用过收费物品后仍要派人检查。我看了之前的点评中对门童大叔的描述，特例留意了一下，果然名不虚传。晶丽值得一住。,"I lived in this hotel on June 2, 2006. Jingli's service is still very good. The trust given to guests at the checkout is very rare. Unlike most hotels, I asked if I have used toll items.People check.I read the description of Uncle Men Tong in the previous review. I paid attention to the special case.Jingli is worth living."
1,不愧是westin，房间就不用说了，游泳池啊roomservice都很不错！卫生间很大！,"It is indeed Westin, there is no need to say the room. The swimming pool RoomService is very good!The bathroom is large!"
1,服务非常好，很快，但是硬件设施太老，卫生间有味道，目前在装修，早7点就有动工的机器声，打扰美梦。但是结帐时前台主动咨询意见，并给抱歉，非常人性化的服务，还有在电梯里主动让客人，很不错的服务。早餐很中式，习惯西餐的恐怕没的吃了。宾馆反馈2008年6月2日：尊敬的客人：您好！感谢您惠顾唐山锦江贵宾楼饭店，您的下榻令我们深感荣幸。您的留言我们已经收到，首先要谢谢您对我店前台服务给予的良好评价。另外，关于您提出的“硬件设施太老”的意见，可能您已经留意到，我店正在进行装修改造，力求为广大宾客创造一个舒适、优美的居停环境，为此还打扰了您的休息，我们感到十分抱歉，并已与施工单位接洽，尽量避开客人的休息时间，恳请您能给予理解和支持。同时，收到您提出的“西式早餐品种少”的意见后，我店餐饮部特别给予了关注，将针对客人口味，适当调换品种，相信在您下次光临时会有所改善。关于您提出的“卫生间有味道”的意见，由于您已离店，无法当面与您进行交流，但我们会进一步加强客房服务员的操作程序，使房间环境更加整洁、干净。再次谢谢您的中肯评价，真诚地感谢您对唐山锦江贵宾楼饭店的支持，并恭候您的再次下榻！祝您身体健康，工作顺利，万事如意！,"The service is very good, soon, but the hardware facilities are too old, and the bathroom has the taste. At present, there is a sound of machinery at 7 o'clock in the decoration.However, at the checkout, the front desk took the initiative to consult the opinion, and sorry, very humane service, as well as actively let guests in the elevator, very good service.Breakfast is very Chinese, and I am afraid that western food is not eaten.Hotel feedback on June 2, 2008: Dear guest: Hello!Thank you for the sake of Hui Tangshan's Jinjiang VIP Tower Hotel.We have received your message. First of all, thank you for your good evaluation of the service given by the front desk of our store.In addition, you may notice that the ""hardware facilities are too old"" you put forward is that our store is being renovated to create a comfortable and beautiful stop -stop environment for the majority of guests. This also disturb your rest.We are very sorry, and we have contacted with the construction unit to avoid the rest time of the guests. I hope you can give understanding and support.At the same time, after receiving the opinion of ""Little Western Breakfast varieties"" you put forward, our restaurant's restaurant department has given special attention and will change the variety appropriately for guest tastes. I believe that you will improve the temporary temporary next time.The opinion on the ""taste of the bathroom"" you put forward, because you have left the store and cannot communicate with you in person, but we will further strengthen the operating procedures of the guest room waiter to make the room environment more neat and clean.Thank you again for your evaluation, sincerely thank you for your support for the VIP Tower Hotel in Tangshan, and waiting for your stay again!I wish you good health, work smoothly, everything!"
1,"再一次入住该酒店,感觉还是不错的.房间干净、服务人员的态度也满好的。这家酒店的位置不错，出入非常的方便。下次还来住","Staying in the hotel again, it feels good. The room is clean and the attitude of the service staff is also good.The location of this hotel is good, and it is very convenient to enter and exit.Come to live next time"
1,"价格便宜,环境幽雅,就是餐厅跟不上,但服务态度及房间配置基本达","The price is cheap, the environment is elegant, but the restaurant cannot keep up, but the service attitude and the configuration of the room are basically reached."
1,依海而建，地理位置绝佳，旁边就是星海广场。床特别大，很舒适，房间里有咖啡包，但有一天服务生忘了放。早餐味道还不错，但品种少，多待了几天会吃腻。那里的果汁饮料只有西瓜汁、橙汁，我尝了一口橙汁，味道很淡，香精味浓，很难入口，热咖啡还可以。,"Built according to the sea, the geographical location is excellent, and there is Xinghai Plaza next to it.The bed is particularly large and comfortable. There is a coffee bag in the room, but one day the waiter forgot to put it.Breakfast tastes good, but there are less varieties, and you will get tired after a few days.The juice drinks there are only watermelon juice and orange juice. I tasted a bite of orange juice. The taste was light, the flavor was strong, it was difficult to enter, and the hot coffee was ok."
1,预订之后才看的别人点评，立刻感觉有点紧张，甚至都想取消预订。真正入住以后，才发现没有网友反映那么不好。房间设施还是可以的，灯光设计比较舒服，宽带上网、免费长话、房间服务都还不错，早餐也还可以。店前确实在修路，但没有那么恐怖，我住的临街房，双层玻璃完全可以隔音的，当然我是住在15层。打车也还没那么困难，只要不在早晚高峰，还是比较方便的。周遭餐饮也还丰富，但要走对方向。368的房价，相比安徽消费水平来说，的确有点不低，但总体还是可以选择入住的。,"After the booking, the comments that I watched were a little nervous immediately, and even wanted to cancel the booking.After I really stayed, I found that no netizens reported that it was so bad.The room facilities are still available. The lighting design is more comfortable. Broadband Internet, free long words, and room services are not bad. Breakfast is ok.The road is indeed in front of the shop, but it is not so horrible. The street room where I live in, double -layer glass can sound soundproof. Of course, I live on the 15th floor.It is not so difficult to take a taxi. As long as it is not in the morning and evening peaks, it is more convenient.The surrounding restaurants are also rich, but go to the direction.The price of 368 is indeed a bit low compared to the consumption level of Anhui, but it can still choose to stay."
0,"顶多附合三星标准,电梯灯光昏暗，房间隔音奇差，房间装修较陈旧,地毯较脏,基本的小形吧台、冰箱都没有，保龄球、游泳池等设施形同虚设，早餐很差。更特别的是，由入住到离店都未能有幸听到服务员的一句“谢谢”，是我住过的最差的四星酒店。","At most, the Samsung standard is attached. The elevator lights are dim, the room's sound insulation is poor, the room decoration is relatively old, the carpet is dirty, the basic small bar tables and refrigerators are none.What's more, I was fortunate to hear the waiter's ""thank you"" from staying from staying to the store. It is the worst four -star hotel I have lived."
1,在临沂，这个酒店算是比较有档次的了，给外国客人的服务也比较合格。可惜电视内容比较单调，国外的频道很少。服务态度不错。,"In Linyi, this hotel is relatively grade, and the services to foreign guests are also qualified.Unfortunately, TV content is relatively monotonous, and there are very few foreign channels.The service attitude is good."
1,我们要了2个房间，一个有阳台一个没有，感觉明显有阳台的房间感觉比较舒服，没阳台的就很压抑。,"We asked for two rooms, one with a balcony and one, and the room with obviously felt more comfortable, and it was very depressed if there was no balcony."
1,"酒店的早餐太差,多少年都一样,果汁也改为果珍了,实在和4颗星不符!","The breakfast of the hotel is too bad, and the fruit juice has been changed to Guozhen for many years. It really does not match the 4 stars!"
1,走沪杭高速的话，路过嘉兴东出口千万别下，到乍嘉苏高速匝道右转，再往前约10公里，到嘉兴出口，出了收费站左前方就是嘉兴世茂花园大酒店的入口。四星级花园式度假酒店，达不到五星级标准，冬天去冷冷清清的，一定要选朝南向阳的房间，否则室内空调温度调到30摄氏度，实际最高也只能达到17摄氏度。早餐标准也是四星级的，不过有酸奶。,"If you walk to the Shanghai -Hangzhou high -speed speed, do n’t go down by the export of Jiaxing, turn right at the Chagasu high -speed ramp, and then take about 10 kilometers to the exit of Jiaxing. The entrance of the Jiaxing Shimao Garden Hotel is out of the toll station.The four -star garden -style resort hotel does not meet the five -star standard. To go deserted in winter, you must choose a room facing the south of the south.Breakfast standards are also four -star, but there are yogurt."
1,很不错呀，就是浴室太搞笑了，三个水龙头，也没标哪个热水哪个冷水。电梯太慢，其它都还好，早餐很不错，喜欢蒸红薯和南瓜，还有热果珍喝~,"Very good, that is, the bathroom is so funny. The three faucets are not marked with any hot water.The elevator is too slow, and the others are okay. The breakfast is very good. I like steamed sweet potatoes and pumpkin, and hot fruit."
1,酒店交通不是很方便，离市区较远，火车站过来大约17、8块，因为地处开发区，住过来的大多数人都是来开发区各个公司办事的，尤以奇瑞的供货商和客户居多。说实话有些意料之外的惊喜了，没想到芜湖有性价比这么高的酒店。住的是行政标准间，房间很大，除了两张床还有一个很不错的办公桌，卫生间干湿两用，淋浴房和浴缸供客人各取所需，水量也很足，用的洗发水和浴液也不是大多数酒店用的蹩脚货，是分别两大罐家用的脱普产品；既可以烧开水也可以喝酒店提供的直接饮用水。服务也很不错，入住退房都很快，所有遇到你的工作人员都会礼貌的说你好！门童非常的客气，离开酒店的时候门口没有车，一位门童顶着烈日走出接近1里地在另一条路上帮我拦车进来，实在有些不好意思。客房送餐速度也很快，菜式量足味道也不错，除了叫客房送餐单的菜式也可以让他们送中餐菜单上来选。唯一不足的可能就是他们的自助早餐了吧。实在没什么可吃的，而且去晚了，几乎就都见底了。服务员加菜也不是很积极，就算加也都是加一丁点，一个人就拿完了，不知道是不是因为自助早餐怕客人吃多了的缘故……总的来说，环境和服务还是不错的，有机会再去的话还是会住在那里。,"Hotel transportation is not very convenient. It is far from the urban area. The railway station comes about 17 or 8 yuan. Because it is located in the development zone, most people who live in the development zone are working in the development zone.Most of them with customers.To be honest, I had some unexpected surprises. I did not expect that Wuhu had such cost -effective hotels.I live in the administrative standard room. The room is large. In addition to the two beds, there is a very good desk. The bathroom and bathtub are used for the bathroom and bathtub for the guests to take.The bath liquid is not a feet used for most hotels. It is a break product for two tanks of households. It can boil water or drink direct drinking water provided by the hotel.The service is also very good, and the check -in and check -out room is very fast. All the staff who meet you will be polite to say hello!Menstong was very polite. When he left the hotel, there was no car at the door. A door child walked out of the scorching sun to help me from getting in on the other road. It was a little embarrassed.The room for meals in the guest room is also fast, and the dishes are good. In addition to calling the rooms for the guest room, the dishes can also be selected for them to send the menu menu.The only shortcomings may be their buffet breakfast.There is nothing to eat, and it is late, almost all of them.The waiter and vegetables are not very active. Even if they are added, they will finish it. I do n’t know if it ’s because the buffet breakfast is afraid of the guests to eat too much ... In general, the environment and services are good.If you have a chance, you will live there."
1,本人已入住3次，对该酒店印象较好：房间面积可，服务好，环境也可以。缺点是：卫生间小，卫生间设施教陈旧，门口出租车较少，高峰时间很难拦到车。,"I have stayed 3 times, and I have a better impression on the hotel: the room area is available, the service is good, and the environment is also available.The disadvantage is that the bathroom is small, the bathroom facilities teach Chen Lao, there are fewer taxis at the door, and it is difficult to stop the car at the peak time."
1,的确像很多网友说的，硬件设施不错，但服务太差！只能有招待所的水平！前台小姐听不懂chickin是什么意思，没想法！因为我的信用卡不是国际卡，所以没有visa或master的标志，竟,"It is true like many netizens say that the hardware facilities are good, but the service is too bad!There can only be a level of a guest house!The front desk lady does not understand what Chickin means, no idea!Because my credit card is not an international card, there is no sign of VISA or Master, but"
0,1酒店基本需要用品没有，比如要求转换插头、水壶，也一律欠缺！欠缺理由为“由于全家酒店客房已满，所以没有任何多一个后备用品作替换”（这是酒店服务员原话）2酒店水壶内有残余物，约一元硬币那么厚。酒店服务员竟然说“知道这个情况，但是没有办法”！3酒店早餐很差，不像3星酒店应有水平，4冬天的暖气空调是按需提供，不问基本不给；5暖气跟呼噜一样，整个晚上吵到天明（因为本人天明就马上退房）；6热水器名不符实，应该叫“水器”，因为基本不热,"1 Basically, there are no supplies in hotels, such as requiring conversion plugs and kettles, and they are also lacking!The lack of reason is that ""because the guest rooms in the family are full, there is no more backup supplies for replacement"" (this is the original word of the hotel waiter) 2 There are residues in the hotel kettle, which is as thick as one yuan coins.The hotel waiter even said, ""Knowing this, but there is no way""!3 The breakfast of the hotel is very poor, unlike the 3 -star hotel, the heating and air conditioner in 4 winter is provided on demand, and it is basically not given without asking.); 6 The name of the water heater is not true, it should be called ""water heater"" because it is basically not hot"
0,交通非常方便，娱乐也方便。可是环境太差，太吵。晚上的骚扰电话实在太多。不知道为什么酒店不能隔绝这些骚扰电话。不知道住客姓名的外来电话应该一一阻挡。,Transportation is very convenient and entertainment is also convenient.But the environment is too bad and too noisy.There are too many harassment calls at night.I don't know why the hotel can't isolate these harassing calls.I do n’t know if the home call of the resident name should be blocked one by one.
1,"5月3日全家四口自驾游,订了两室一厅住了两天,来的很多都是这样的人.酒店房间环境都可以,门口免费停车,有一个不大的泳池,免费,地下健身要收费.电梯间设计很窄.两房一厅两张大床,1.5米和1.8米,只有一个洗手间,厅内沙饭桌齐,厨房还配有电饭锅,冰箱.适合一家大小住,象一个临时的家.北海不大,自驾到处都很近,无所谓一定要住银滩.二楼的餐厅味道不错,价格也不贵.补充点评2007年6月13日：补充一下,床垫太差,上层跟没垫东西似的,都可以用手轻易摸到钢丝的格子和交结,晚上被硌得受不了,打电话问前台是否有多余的被褥可以铺在上面缓解一下的,前台竟然说没有多余的被子.死忍了两天,天天睡不好,早上起床腰酸背痛.强烈建议酒店改进一下.","On May 3rd, the family traveled four self -driving tours.

0,无论从软件还是硬件该酒店都达不到四星标准。电视机无名品牌色彩很差，电视节目没有任何国际卫星电视节目。如何带外宾入住。标间618元。哈尔滨随便都能找到比它好的。最无法容忍的是我公司两个部门共六个人入住共六间标间，都是通过携程订房，2月5日晚是五个人，另一个部门的三个人是四百多元，而我们部门的两个人是618元。这样的差价叫我们如何提交给同一个外国老板签字报销。我只能理解为黑店斩人，斩到一个是一个。哈尔滨宾馆林立，我是绝对不会再次去金谷挨斩了。希望其它客人要小心，货比三家，并要核对不同的时段，切防挨斩。,"Both the software and the hardware that the hotel cannot meet the four -star standard.The color of the TV unknown brand is very poor, and there is no international satellite TV program on the TV show.How to take a foreign guest.The standard room is 618 yuan.Harbin can find better than it.The most unbearable is that the two departments of our company have a total of six people in a total of six standard rooms. They are reservations through Ctrip. On the evening of February 5th, there were five people, and the three people in the other department were more than 400 yuan.The two people were 618 yuan.This difference tells us how to submit to the same foreign boss to sign for reimbursement.I can only understand that it is a black shop cut, and one is one.Harbin Hotel Lin Li, I will never go to Jintu again.I hope that other guests should be careful, the goods are compared with three, and they must check different times and cut off."
0,住的商务大床房，携程定的238，入住的时候，前台说有会员卡入住只要228，携程的价格没竞争力。会员卡一张50，如果住4天，基本费用就全部回来了。房间很小，浴室的淋浴喷头连管子都喷水，看来是坏了很久了。有一个男服务员态度及其恶劣，忘了记他的工号，可惜了。不会再去住了。宾馆反馈2008年8月12日：酒店客房内的设施设备定期由工程部人员进行维修，如遇该客户这样的情况可向客房部反映，工程部会派人到房间当场维修。另外，如该客户提到前台员工的服务态度有问题，望其能第一时间向前厅经理反映，以便酒店方能及时改过。让事情得以解决。希望该客户今后依然能选择我酒店,"Living in a large business bed, Ctrip's 238, when you check in, the front desk said that there are only 228 membership cards in the front desk, and the price of Ctrip is not competitive.A member card is 50. If you live 4 days, the basic costs will return.The room was small, and the shower head of the bathroom sprayed water even the tube. It seemed that it had been broken for a long time.There is a male waiter's attitude and his bad attitude and forgot to remember his work number, but unfortunately.I won't go to live again.Hotel feedback on August 12, 2008: The facilities and equipment in the hotel rooms are regularly repaired by the personnel of the engineering department. If the customer is encountered, it can be reported to the guest room department.In addition, if the customer mentioned that there is a problem with the service attitude of the front desk employees, it is hoped that it can report to the manager of the front hall as soon as possible so that the hotel can change it in time.Let things solve.I hope this customer will still choose my hotel in the future"
1,已经是第四次入住了。先是订了156的大床房，感谢设施陈旧了许多，尤其是洗手间，第一是小，第二是很不合理，一洗澡整个卫生间湿漉漉的。后来换了176的房间，前台说这是他们这里最好的房间，这次这个还像样，安静、整洁，配套的东西很多，晚上可以“叮”食物，热了好吃，电磁炉都有，还有个晾衣架。总体来讲，房间很大，布局还算合理，卫生间也是我在这里住过所有房型中最大的，基本满意。好象它这里房型好多不一样，住了四次，两次156的，不一样；两次176的，房间布局也不一样。看来以后得挑一下。比较郁闷的一点是，冰箱那些可乐啊食品啊，吃完喝完以后，他们打扫卫生的时候是不会帮你自动补上的。,"It is already the fourth time.First of all, I booked a large bed of 156. Thanks to the facilities a lot, especially the toilet. The first is small, and the second is very unreasonable. The whole bathroom is wet in a bath.Later, I changed to 176 rooms. The front desk said that this is the best room here. This time, this is also decent, quiet, tidy, and supporting. There are many things that can be ""dangled"" at night.There is a drying rack.Overall, the room is large and the layout is quite reasonable. The bathroom is also the largest and basically satisfied.It seems that there are a lot of room types here. They lived four times, 156 times, different; two times 176, the room layout is different.It seems to be picked in the future.The more depressed thing is that those cola foods in the refrigerator. After eating and drinking, they will not help you automatically make up when they clean up."
1,就是老了点，个别房间窗户小，隔音差，其他很好，毕竟是老牌三星级吗！,"Just get older, the windows of individual rooms are small, the sound insulation is poor, and the others are very good. After all, is it the old -fashioned three -star!"
1,酒店非常好，距离高速出口很近，服务也很到位，值得推荐的酒店，到泰山应该是最好的酒店了．,"The hotel is very good, it is very close to high -speed exports, and the service is in place. It is worth recommending hotels. It should be the best hotel in Taishan."
1,"酒店的大堂不大,看起来不够豪华.但是服务人员都非常的热情.房间比较大,设施一般但是还算干净.第一次入住该酒店,到大堂询问附近的餐厅,大堂副理居然是非常年轻的漂亮小姐,笑容让人很舒心,好意的提醒我们原本想去的得月楼只不过名声在外,不实惠味道也一般,并且热情的介绍了边上的天竺酒楼,去是过以后果然如她所言实惠又好吃.吃完饭过后到附近逛了才发现地理位置非常好,逛街非常方便.顺便提一下,酒店内部有一个沐足的地方,房客用抵用券可以打折扣,按摩的手法非常的专业.第二天走的时候门口没有出租车,行李生冒着大雨出去叫车,还是非常的让人感动的.补充点评2008年1月20日：软件达到五星标准，硬件打个３.５星吧，应该改造了，呵呵．下次还来","The lobby of the hotel is not large, and it looks not luxurious enough. But the service staff are very enthusiastic. The room is relatively large, the facilities are average, but it is still clean. The first time I stayed in the hotel and asked the restaurant nearby.The young and beautiful lady, the smile is very comfortable, and reminds us of the Yuelou we originally wanted to go.What she said is affordable and delicious. After eating after eating, I found that the geographical location is very good, and it is very convenient to go shopping. By the way, there is a place in the hotel.The technique is very professional. When I left the next day, there was no taxi at the door, and the luggage rushed out of the rain to call the car. It was still very moving. Supplementary review January 20, 2008: The software reaches five -star standards, and the hardware is hit.3.5 Star, it should be transformed, haha.Come next time"
1,很不错的酒店，服务也到位，住宿价格以所在的路段来看都是非常合理的酒店楼下有海鲜自助晚餐，可能是去的比较晚了，所以菜色比较少，78元每个人，凭房卡还能有个85折优惠；唯一觉得这顿饭不值得的地方就是我和先生要了一瓶黄酒，我估计这个黄酒在上海最多也就30多，结果结帐的时候竟然一瓶酒159？呵呵，不过也正常，酒店嘛，谁让我事先没有问清楚呢还有就是别在房间里面消费酒水，半夜太渴了，冰箱里面随便拿了一瓶广东一带经常见的矿泉水，好像是佳宝反正绝对不是依云，是绿色的。结帐的时候我主动汇报自己喝了一瓶矿泉水，本以为10块钱够了，结果是25块大洋！呵呵不过我下次还是会选择这个酒店，周围很方便，服务生态度又超好！关键是旁边就有一个“福青龙”大酒店，里面的早茶真不错深圳广州的服务也比上海好！,"Very good hotels, the service is also in place, the accommodation price is very reasonable from the section of the road, there is a very reasonable hotel with seafood buffet dinner downstairs. It may be late, so the dishes are relatively small.The card can also have a 85 % discount; the only thing that I think this meal is not worth it is that I and my husband asked a bottle of rice wine. I estimate that this rice wine is more than 30 in Shanghai. As a result, a bottle of wine was 159.IntersectionHehe, but it is normal, the hotel, who made me not ask in advance, and do n’t consume wine in the room, it ’s too thirsty in the middle of the night. I just took a bottle of mineral water in Guangdong.Bao is definitely not Yiyun anyway, it is green.When I checked the checkout, I took the initiative to report myself to drink a bottle of mineral water. I thought that 10 yuan was enough, and the result was 25 oceans!Hehe, but I will choose this hotel next time, it is very convenient, the service ethics is super good!The key is that there is a ""Fuqinglong"" hotel next to it. The morning tea in it is really good. Shenzhen and Guangzhou are better than Shanghai!"
0,"外表还算过得去，一出电梯就是一股浓重的发霉味；在房间时服务员不敲门不按门铃就进入我的房间，吓出一身冷汗；结账时居然不会刷卡，由于我的信用卡没有密码,居然连刷2次，刷了2倍房费；12点就没有热水，正月初8空调只能达到15度;这样的酒店早就应该降级！","The appearance is still too much. As soon as the elevator is out, it is a strong moldy smell; when the room is in the room, the waiter enters my room without knocking on the door or the doorbell, scaring a cold sweat; it will not swipe the card at the checkout. Because my credit card has no password, there is no password for passwordIn fact, brushed twice, brushing 2 times the room fee; there is no hot water at 12 o'clock, and the 8 air conditioners can only reach 15 degrees on the beginning of the first month; such a hotel should have been downgraded for a long time!"
1,酒店环境不错，早餐非常丰富，就是房间小了点。另外5楼的足浴实在是掏浆糊，不停的推销精油开背，还要到房间里给我们做，有那种干活的嫌疑，但是也理解这是酒店的外包项目和酒店没关系。所以总体来讲很喜欢这个酒店。,"The hotel environment is good, and the breakfast is very rich, but the room is a little smaller.In addition, the foot bath on the 5th floor is really paste, and the essential oil is kept on the back of the essential oil, and it is necessary to do it in the room. There is a suspicion of work, but it is also understandable that this is the hotel's outsourcing project and the hotel.So in general, I like this hotel very much."
1,这次入住感觉酒店气氛蛮浓，早餐品种超“丰富”，意外的是，走的时候酒店有班车免费送我到机场，在车上“金钥匙”向我详细介绍了机场班车的情况。特别在这里发布，希望给像我这样这样经常出差到瑞安的朋友做个参考每日酒店发车：6：00AM―10：00AM机场返回酒店发车：19：00PM―21：30PM机场返回,"The atmosphere of the hotel felt that the hotel was quite strong this time, and the breakfast varieties were super ""rich"". Surprisingly, when I left, the hotel had a shuttle bus to the airport for free. The ""golden key"" on the car introduced me in detail the situation of the airport train.Published here, I hope to give friends who often travel to Ruian like me to make a reference daily hotel departure: 6: 00 AM -10: 00am Airport Return to the hotel to depart"
0,到达后前台看了我手机上的预定确认的短信，又翻查了一些FAX，仍说没有接到过携程预定通知，直到我用手机打了携程电话要服务员接听才得到房间。不知问题出在哪里？酒店在十字路口，入夜都非常嘈杂，主要是汽车长按喇叭的声音。若非出差需要（靠近客户），不会住这里。下次也争取不再入住。酒店设施一般，早餐7点开始，但到8点半都还没有多少可吃的，早退房的相当于没有早餐。,"I arrived at the front desk and looked at the scheduled SMS on my mobile phone, and checked some FAX. I still said that I had not received a notice from Ctrip. It was not until I used a mobile phone to call the waiter to answer the room before I got the room.I don't know where the problem is?The hotel is at the crossroads, and it is very noisy at night, mainly because the sound of the car long press the horn.If you do not need to travel (close to the customer), you will not live here.Next time I will strive not to stay.The hotel facilities are average. Breakfast starts at 7 o'clock, but there is not much food at 8:30. The premature out of the house is equivalent to no breakfast."
1,地理位置对出差的人士来说还是很方便的，好找啊.,Geographical location is still very convenient for those who travel. It is easy to find.
1,"据同事反映,各方面都不错,下次出差,他们还希望住这家酒店.","According to colleagues, they are good in all aspects. Next time they travel, they also hope to live in this hotel."
0,大家千万不要住这家酒店！这家酒店不论从任何方面都是我住过的酒店中的最差的一家！一点都不值！我是通过携程预定了两间两晚住宿，下午拿到２１楼的房间后发现卫生间的排气扇是坏的（无窗）．要求换了一间后，发现灯又是坏的，服务员说没有房间了，帮我修理．结果我晚上１１点回来后发现灯根本没修，还是坏的．服务员说修理的师傅下班了，找个台灯给我用．总算是住下了．后来朋友从１８楼的房间打电话过来说他房间的淋浴器也是坏的，从管子开始到淋浴头都在出水．我又找了服务员，要求换房间．服务员竟然说这两个房间是最好的了！我们只好将就着住了一晚．第二天一早７：３０就退房了．结帐时因为用了携程的联名信用卡付款，服务员给了我一堆单子，我塞在兜里就走了．结果后来发现没给我开发票，于是打电话让朋友帮我去酒店拿发票．酒店服务员却拒绝说：＂当时结帐时没叫我们开发票，过后就不会补开！＂于是朋友打了酒店负责人电话，也是如此回答．并且这位酒店负责人还说＂随便你去税所投诉，我不怕你！＂没办法，我只好打电话求助携程．而携程的答复更是让我从头凉到脚！携程回复说：＂打了电话去酒店，酒店是这个规定，我们也没办法！＂真是天凉，心更凉啊！我想请问一下我一直如此信任的携程网，你给我们的服务到底比其他服务商好在哪里！我在携程已经是白金贵宾了，我不明白我到底贵在哪里了！！！酒店让我失望，而携程却让我绝望！！！！！！！！！,"Don't stay in this hotel!This hotel is the worst of the hotel I have lived in any aspect!It's not worth it at all!I booked two two -night accommodation through Ctrip. After I got the room on the 21st floor in the afternoon, I found that the exhaust fan in the bathroom was bad (windowless).After asking for another room, I found that the lights were bad again. The waiter said there was no room and helped me repair it.As a result, after I came back at 11 o'clock in the evening, I found that the lights were not repaired at all, and it was still bad.The waiter said that the repaired master was off work and found a table lamp for me.I finally lived.Later, my friend called from the room on the 18th floor and said that the shower in his room was also bad. From the pipe to the shower head, he was water out of water.I found the waiter again and asked to change the room.The waiter even said that these two rooms are the best!We had to live for one night.I checked out at 7:30 the next morning.During the checkout, I used Ctrip's joint credit card to pay, and the waiter gave me a bunch of lists, and I stuffed it in my pocket.As a result, I found that I did not invoiced me, so I called my friends to help me go to the hotel to get invoices.The hotel waiter refused to say, ""At that time, we did not call us to issue an invoice at the time of checkout, and they would not make up after the checkout!"" So the friend called the hotel in charge of the hotel and answered so.And the person in charge of the hotel also said, ""Just go to the tax office to complain, I am not afraid of you!"" No way, I had to call to help the portable.And Ctrip's reply made me cold from head to toe!Ctrip replied: ""After calling to the hotel, the hotel is this rule, and we can't help it!"" It is really cool, the heart is cooler!I want to ask Ctrip.com, which I have always trusted so much, where your service gives us better than other service providers!I'm already a platinum VIP in Ctrip, I don't understand where I am expensive!IntersectionIntersectionThe hotel disappointed me, but Ctrip made me desperate!IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersection"
1,定了个商务大床房，整个房间有一半是对这主干道的落地窗户，景色很不错。房间很大，很舒服。希望下次还能有机会住这里,There is a large business bed room. Half of the entire room is a floor -to -ceiling window for this main road. The scenery is very good.The room is large and comfortable.I hope there will be a chance to live here next time
1,几个月前，曾经住过一次国际金融。感觉不好，就住鸢飞了。这次朋友到潍坊，鸢飞客满，那何妨再试试国际金融？兴许改进了呢不料朋友还是摇头。我以后自己住一次，看朋友是否在骗我。,"A few months ago, I had lived in international finance.It doesn't feel good, just live in kite flying.This time, my friend arrived in Weifang, and the kite flying guests are full, so why not try international finance again?Maybe it was improved, but my friend still shook his head.I lived once in the future to see if my friends were lying to me."
1,这是一家国营的宾馆，感觉一般般！设施比较陈旧！,"This is a state -owned hotel, it feels average!The facilities are old!"
1,万豪旗下的酒店，管理不错。酒店环境也很好。,Marriott's hotel is well managed.The hotel environment is also very good.
0,换了2次房间，刚入住的时候，房间是脏的，那个时候已经下午2点半了。然后换房，热水是坏的，然后和大堂经理交涉，又换了房，说是Upgrade了，结果空调是坏的，害我早上起来感冒。然后我出去办事，我打电话给前台，让他们派人去修，结果。。我下午回到酒店根本没有人来修过。这是什么四星级酒店？？？设施也很烂，电视机很小很小。性价比实在太低了。一塌糊涂！！！！！,"After changing the room twice, the room was dirty when I first moved in. At that time, it was 2:30 pm.Then change the house, the hot water is bad, and then negotiated with the lobby manager, and changed the room again, saying that it was upgrade. As a result, the air conditioner was bad, and it hurt me to get a cold in the morning.Then I went out to work, I called the front desk, and asked them to send someone to repair it.EssenceNo one came back to the hotel in the afternoon.What four -star hotels are this?IntersectionIntersectionThe facilities are also bad, and the TV is very small.The price / performance ratio is too low.A mess!IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersection"
0,不值得这个价装修很一般酒店外是烧烤一条街早餐非常简陋，没啥吃的。下次决不选择它。连申请延迟退房都不肯,"It is not worth the decoration of this price. Generally, the breakfast of a barbecue on the street is very simple and has nothing to eat.Never choose it next time.Even if you apply for a delayed check -up, you are unwilling to"
1,每次都住这里！尤其是餐厅，让人流连忘返：）,Live here every time!Especially restaurants make people linger :)
1,"我住的是豪华大床间,368元1、冬季房间很冷，空调连续开了2天才暖和过来。2、该宾馆显然不是按4星级宾馆建造的。3、沙发很脏，毛巾感觉很陈旧，浴袍的领子一圈脏。4、服务不错，我用电脑，服务员主动提供一个插座5、家具床铺都不错。总的说来价格偏贵，300元左右还差不多，不知标准间怎么样","I live in a luxurious large bed, 368 yuan 1. The room in winter is very cold, and the air conditioner has been warm for 2 consecutive days.2. The hotel is obviously not built by 4 -star hotels.3. The sofa is dirty, the towel feels old, and the collar of the bathrobe is dirty.4. The service is good. I use a computer. The waiter actively provides a socket 5. Furniture beds are good.In general, the price is too expensive, and it is similar to about 300 yuan. I do n’t know how the standard room is."
1,该酒店楼层比较高，所以对自驾游的朋友来说，酒店容易找的到。我住的是20楼，那个位置基本可以俯瞰整个横店，观赏性比较好。酒店设施比较好，比较新。如果不是自驾游的话，那有麻烦的，因为酒店在市中心以外，很难叫到出租车的。补充点评2008年7月6日：地下是专用车位，游客不能停车,"The hotel floor is relatively high, so it is easy for the hotel to find it for friends from self -driving tour.I live in the 20th floor. That position can basically overlook the entire Hengdian, and the viewing is better.Hotel facilities are better and new.If it wasn't for self -driving, it was troublesome, because the hotel was outside the city center, it would be difficult to call taxis.Supplementary review July 6, 2008: Dedicated parking spaces underground, tourists cannot park"
0,这是第二次入住，感觉服务不如去年热情了。房间里很大的烟味，喷了两次空气清新剂，开了整整两天的窗户，空调和排气扇也开了整整两天的通风，结果临走时烟味仍然很大。衣服上熏得全都是烟味。希望酒店能检查一下，看看究竟是怎么回事。房间设施比较一般，毛巾和浴巾明显看起来很陈旧了。卫生间洗面盆的边缘露出了一圈污渍，让人看起来很不舒服。房间的隔音也不好。补充点评2008年4月1日：从这里打车去机场，走三环路，一共用了25分钟（没有堵车），花费68元。,"This is the second time to check in. I feel that the service is not as enthusiastic as last year.The large smoke smell in the room sprayed two fresh air agents, opened the windows for two full days, and the air conditioner and exhaust fan also opened a full two days of ventilation. As a result, the smoke smell was still very large.The clothes are full of smoke.I hope the hotel can check it to see what is going on.The room facilities are relatively average, and towels and bath towels are obviously old.A circle of stains on the edge of the bathroom washbasin makes people look uncomfortable.The sound insulation in the room is not good.Supplementary comment on April 1, 2008: Take a taxi here to the airport, take the third ring road, a total of 25 minutes (no traffic jam), cost 68 yuan."
0,不知道前面这位弟兄是不是和我一样住的同一天。我是7.24入住的，25日一早怀着极其极其悲愤的心情愤然离开。对于房间，极度失望。1、潮湿得不得了，一股浓重的霉味，叫来服务员，说是这几天下雨，比较潮湿，没有办法，要不喷点空气清洗剂。难道这是理由吗？一个4星的酒店，下两天雨，就要住客接受发霉的房间？？？什么逻辑？？？？？2、房间小得不得了。前面那位还有两张床的位子。我那间房间面积为6平方米，卫生间约2平方米！绝对不是危言耸听，我都拍下了照片，如果要和我对质的话，随时奉陪！！！！3、交通极不方便。让前台叫车，必须提前起码半小时，否则，嘿嘿，你就等着吧！4、床上用品！床上用品！！又潮又旧，我也都拍下了照片，床靠背上积着一层厚厚的灰。头发我就没找，因为就那环境，有头发根本不稀奇。5、空调正对着床，因为床两头都顶着墙，因此无论空调朝哪里吹，都对着人。更要命的还在后面：晚上才发现――空调漏水（酒店要不信，去看看你们房间的墙面去），出风口挡板是不能固定的（只能一直摆动）。天哪，可怜的我们啊：打开窗，窗外是虫子不停的鸣叫和其他房间空调室外机的轰鸣；关上窗，6平米的房间闷的我们喘不过气。这叫酒店吗？我怎么觉得是被关在看守所里啊！！！6、我们订的两个一样的房间――商务单人间（因为预订的时候，很多房间已经没有了，只能订这个）。可另一间无论房间大小、房间内设备和物品，都比我们这间强很多，当我们问服务员为什么我们房间没有塑料拖鞋、没有“收费”食品（最普通的矿泉水也是收费的）的时候，服务员回答：“因为房间太小，放了这些就更小了！”同志们，是不是从这里又能感觉到房间真的有多小了吧？7、结帐的时候，竟然还问我：“对房间满意吗？”什么意思？？？我预订两天，结果住了一天就走了，你看不见吗？看不见也就算了，难道你不知道你们的这个房间有多小多差吗？？？？问这话什么意思？？？？？是不是要让我蹲了一晚“看守所”后，还要堆上笑容和你说：“啊，真舒服啊！！！”你们才满意？？？？8、我可以很负责任地说，我是一个很宽容的人，否则入住的时候、结帐的时候，我完全可以据理力争。大家也可以看看我之前对于入住酒店的评价，我想也足以证明一些什么。9、最后一点，想对携程说：从携程创办之后不久，我就是你们的忠实会员，很久之前就成为了你们的钻石贵宾。我想对携程说，你们也有责任要向你们的会员推荐好的酒店，我们不奢求家家都价廉物美，但至少你们要把握住要将价不廉物极差的酒店排除出去，这点要求不过分吧？？？另外，如果你们需要，我可以把我住的房间照片给你们作为证据，或者提供给你们，让大家预订前先看看，这点实事求是的要求不难吧？10、客观地说，早餐还是不错的。服务员的态度还是可以的，虽然回答的内容让人直来气。鉴于以上，我觉得此酒店总体让我非常失望。我们第二天一早就撤了！！以后也不敢再住了！！！！398元，我们加点钱，去住了“泛海名人酒店”，真是一个天一个地啊，着实让我体验了一把什么叫“从地狱到天堂”的感觉。补充一点：离开青岛后去了郑州和山西，刚回来，正想上来发帖子，就看见了前面这位兄弟的评价，实在深有同感，故借鉴了几点意见进行了修改和补充，不过看的出，我住的房间应该比你的还要小。奉劝看到帖子的各位，宁可去找个招待所，也别住这个4星酒店！！！切记切记！！！,"I don't know if the brother in front of him lives on the same day as me.I stayed in 7.24, and left with a very sad and angry mood in the early morning of the 25th.Extremely disappointed in the room.1.

The traffic is extremely inconvenient.Let the front desk call a car, you must take half an hour in advance, otherwise, hey, just wait!4. bedding!bed linings!IntersectionThe tide and old, I also took a picture, and the bed accumulated a thick layer of gray on the back.I didn't find my hair, because in that environment, it was not unusual to have hair at all.5. The air conditioner is facing the bed, because the two ends of the bed are on the wall, so no matter where the air conditioner is blowing, it is facing people.The even more terrible is still later: I found that the air conditioner leaked at night (the hotel should not believe it, go and see the wall of your room), the air outlet baffle cannot be fixed (can only swing all the time).Oh my god, poor us: Open the window, the roar of the bugs and other room air -conditioning outdoor outdoor outside the window; when the window is closed, we can't breathe in the 6 -square -meter room.Is this called a hotel?How do I think I was held in the detention center!IntersectionIntersection6. The two same rooms we ordered by the business single room (because when booking, many rooms are gone, we can only book this).However, the other room is much stronger than the equipment and items in the room. When we ask the waiter why our room does not have plastic slippers, there is no ""charging"" food (the most common mineral water is also charged), The waiter replied, ""Because the room is too small, it will be even smaller!"" The comrades can feel how small the room is from here?7. When checking out, I asked me, ""Are you satisfied with the room?""

I can say very responsiblely that I am a very tolerant person, otherwise I can strive to be based on time when I stay in or at checkout.You can also see my previous evaluation of the hotel, I think it is enough to prove something.9. In the last point, I wanted to say to Ctrip: Shortly after the founding of Ctrip, I was your loyal member, and a long time ago became your diamond VIP.I want to tell Ctrip that you also have the responsibility to recommend good hotels to your members. We do not want to ask your family to be cheap and beautiful, but at least you must grasp it.Is it not required?IntersectionIntersectionIn addition, if you need it, I can use the photos of my room as evidence, or to provide you, and let everyone look at it before booking. Isn't the requirement for this truth?10.

0,"房间地毯还有沙发都很脏,床的弹簧都要出来了,很不舒服,以后不会再住了","There are dirty sofas in the carpet in the room, and the spring of the bed is coming out. It is very uncomfortable."
1,本次入住提供的房间较为满意，服务耐心，特别是饭菜比较可口，牛排是比较专业水准的，有圣诞气氛，不错。,"The rooms provided by this stay are relatively satisfactory, and the service is patient, especially the meals are more delicious. Steak is more professional, with Christmas atmosphere, which is good."
1,大年三十入住的酒店，服务好，房间大，早餐也不错。晚上可以看到180度的烟花，很漂亮。再来济南还会选这里。,"Hotels who stay in the 30th year, have good service, big rooms, and breakfast.At night, you can see 180 degrees fireworks, which is beautiful.I will choose here again when I come again."

1,是在2008年4月27日入住的。订这家酒店是因为想在深圳市区待上一天，在携程上看了酒店的介绍，觉得价格还算公道，也是家四星级的酒店，特别是因为是深航和锦江的牌子，才决定定了这家酒店。入住后总体感觉是还可以，但是也有一些地方不是很满意：1。酒店的设施有显陈旧，当然不是古董的那种，只是略显的旧一点点。2。酒店的门童的态度不是特别的令人满意，不会及时地为客户开汽车门。3。酒店的房间靠街道，有一点点吵。以上就是我个人的感觉了。当然，总的来说，还是不错的，性价比高，离机场近，景观不错。,"It was staying on April 27, 2008.I booked this hotel because I want to stay in Shenzhen for a day in Shenzhen, and I read the introduction of the hotel on Ctrip. I think the price is fair. It is also a four -star hotel, especially because it is the brand of Shenhang and Jinjiang.The hotel is set.After check -in, the overall feeling is okay, but there are also some places that are not very satisfied: 1.The hotel's facilities are obvious, of course, it is not the kind of antique, it is just a little old.2.The attitude of the hotel door is not particularly satisfactory and will not open a car door for customers in time.3.The hotel's room is on the street, and there is a little noise.The above is my personal feeling.Of course, in general, it is still good, cost -effective, close to the airport, and the landscape is good."
1,"再次帮同事订这个酒店,基本每个月都要有几个同事要住几次我去看过他们酒店,有2种房间印象比较深刻,没厅的房间卫生间确实太大了点装修也不是太新但300多块的价格确是他们的优势,就性价比来说,在古北/虹桥地区来说还是首屈一指的个人感觉这个价位在附近属于断层推荐那种有个大厅的房间,的确是很好,就其他酒店来说绝对是高级套房的待遇了还有个大阳台,我们同事基本都订这个房间,携程推荐的很不错另外看到有些朋友提出的意见,可能他们的确是存在这些问题,可是我觉得就是最好的酒店也有不足,他们酒店的优势在于整个小区环境好,地段好方便购物等帮我们同事提出个建议:安排接送客人来往于房间和前台结帐的电瓶车要多安排,客人太多的时候要等","Help colleagues to book this hotel again, basically several colleagues every month I have to stay a few times. I have seen their hotels. There are 2 kinds of rooms that are more impressive.The price of more than 300 yuan is indeed their advantage. In terms of cost -effectiveness, in the ancient North/Hongqiao area, it is still preferred. Personally, this price belongs to the type of room with a lobby.As far as other hotels are concerned, it is definitely the treatment of high -end suite. There is also a big balcony. Our colleagues basically bind this room. Ctrip recommends very good. Seeing some friends' opinions. Maybe they do exist, but they do exist, but they do exist.I think the best hotels are also inadequate. The advantage of their hotel is that the entire community environment is good, the location is good for shopping, etc. to help our colleagues make a suggestion: arrange the battery cars to pick up the guests in the room and the front deskWait for a long time"
0,太气愤了！去上海住了6次了，3次住的哪里，也算老客户了吧。年前去那里住，在携程上定的房间，订好9-12点之间到，结果10点到了哪里说没房，前台说要等半小时，结果等了50分钟才等到房间。到了房间发现空调是坏的，又让我等了50分钟才给我换到房间郁闷之极。以为165的房间没了，给我换的183的大床房，说好18元的差价给我免了的，结果结账刷卡的时候还是给我多刷了18元，难道你们就是这么对待老顾客的？虽然给我补了60元的抵用券，但是以后还是会考虑住其他的地方。,"Too angry!I went to Shanghai 6 times, where I lived 3 times, and it is considered an old customer.Go there in the year before, and set up the room set up in Ctrip, and settle between 9-12 points. As a result, where did you say that there was no room at 10 o'clock, the front desk said that he would have to wait half an hour, and the result was 50 minutes before waiting for the room.When I arrived at the room, I found that the air conditioner was bad, and I waited for 50 minutes to change me to the room depression.I thought the room of 165 was gone. Give me a large bed in 183, saying that the difference of 18 yuan was avoided. As a result, I still brushed me more than 18 yuan when checking out the card.of?Although I gave me a 60 yuan coupon, I will still consider living in other places in the future."
1,房间不错，性价比很好。但餐饮单调，没有地方特色。周边绿化不错，但离城里很远，出门逛街不便。总的说来，价格挺合理的,"The room is good and the price is good.But the dining is monotonous and has no local characteristics.The surrounding area is good, but it is far from the city and is inconvenient to go out.In general, the price is quite reasonable"
0,"此酒店再次令人失望,2年前住过此酒店,当时给我感觉很失望.今年四月再次入住,更加让人失望,房间家具更加破旧,自助早餐,中餐难以下咽,一共住了4晚,其间一晚还赶上停电2次,那个黑呀,好象连防火应急灯都没了,当时真替电梯里的人担心,结果酒店没给任何解释和道歉.结帐时又被莫明奇妙的要收视频点播费,跟他们据理力争,结果前台那小姐冷笑的看着我好象我点播了什么却不承认,我心理话,就你们那破电视,屏幕都不如我手提电脑的屏幕大,值得我点播视频吗!好在,最后取消了此笔费用,但被他们冤枉,很让人不舒服.唉......住过很多酒店,此酒店人让我印象深刻........宾馆反馈2008年5月1日：首先对停电事件表示歉意,此次停电为突发事件,酒店在5分钟就启动了备用电源,但只能提供应急电梯及应急灯,一个小时后将电源切换至其它电路恢复供电,没有像客人所说的停电两次,视频点播为电脑自动记费,观看影片超过180秒后自动记费,电脑显示了点播时间和金额,但是客人拒不承认,后大堂经理将此笔费用免掉,客人用了MINI吧内一块巧克力,后又从外面买回基本相同的一块,在服务员查房时发现,因不是酒店提供的食品,为了下位入住客人安全,不能使用此食品,要求客人付费,客人拒绝付费.","This hotel is disappointing again. I stayed in this hotel 2 years ago. At that time, I felt disappointed. I stayed again in April this year. It was even more disappointing.In the evening, I caught up with the power outage twice a night. That black, as if the fire emergency light was gone. At that time, the people in the elevator were worried. As a result, the hotel did not give any explanation and apology.Brightly wants to watch frequency on -demand fees, and strive to follow them. As a result, the lady in the front desk looked at me as if I was on -demand but did not admit it. I was psychologically talked about, just if you broke the TV, the screen was not as good as my computer computer.The screen is large, is it worthy of my on -demand videos! Fortunately, the fee was canceled in the end, but they were uncomfortable by them, which was very uncomfortable. Alas ... I stayed in a lot of hotels......... Hotel feedback on May 1, 2008: First apologize to the power outage event. The power outage is an emergency. The hotel starts the backup power supply in 5 minutes, but it can only provide emergency elevators and emergency emergency.Light, switch the power to other circuits after an hour to restore power supply. There is no power outage like the guest. The video is broadcast as a computer automatic fee. After watching the video for more than 180 seconds, the computer shows the on -demand time and amount.However, the guest refused to admit that the back lobby manager would avoid the cost of this pen. The guest used a chocolate inside the mini bar, and then bought it back from the outside.In order to stay in the guests' safety, the food cannot be used, and the guests are required to pay. The guests refuse to pay."
0,以前我们的客人入住该酒店，一直对酒店印象不错，但是这次,"In the past, our guests stayed in the hotel and had been impressed by the hotel, but this time"
1,当地最好的酒店，房间环境都很好，地理位置稍微欠缺一点，下次还会入住。,"The best local hotels, the room environment is very good, the geographical location is slightly lacking, and will stay in the next time."
1,酒店的位置偏了一点，但其实还是挺好找的。乘地铁在铜锣湾站下，再换乘到跑马地的电车，在总站下（约15分钟），酒店就位于总站的养和医院旁。（注：香港的电车与国内的不一样，是没有号数的，只在车头标志总站地名）。若乘出租车，从铜锣湾过去也是5-10分钟。酒店的设施较新，室内环境也不错，但是房间好小，床位小得可怜，标间的单床就真的只能睡一个人，稍胖一点的人都睡不下。服务还可以。,"The location of the hotel is a little bit, but it is actually very easy to find.Take the subway under the Causeway Bay Station, and then transfer to the tram of Malaysia, under the terminus (about 15 minutes), the hotel is located next to the hospital's raising hospital.(Note: Hong Kong's tram is different from the domestic ones, there are no numbers, only the place name of the headmark of the front).If you take a taxi, it is 5-10 minutes from the past.The hotel's facilities are relatively new, and the indoor environment is good, but the room is small, the beds are poor, and the single bed in the standard room can really only sleep one person.The service is okay."
0,过了好久才想起来评价，记得离火车站超级近，不过方便的同时必然会觉得比较吵。韩日旅游团住这里的很多，前台服务冷淡。两个人住标准间，只给一张房卡，还很挑衅的看我。气的没心情。宾馆反馈2008年7月17日：酒店针对客人提出的问题，现已认真整改，希望每一位入住渤海明珠酒店的您都能高兴入住，满意而归。,"After a long time, I remembered the evaluation. Remember to be super close to the train station, but it will inevitably feel more noisy at the same time.Many of the South Korean and Japan Tourism Troupes live here, and the front desk service is cold.The two people lived in the standard room, only gave a room card, and looked at me very provocatively.I was moodless.Hotel feedback on July 17, 2008: The hotel has taken a serious rectification on the problems raised by the guests. I hope that you will be happy to stay in the Bohai Bingsu Hotel."
1,第二次入住，在上海的首选。虽然没啥名气，但软硬件设施非常好。大床太舒服了。住在里面，白天不像上班，晚上不想去夜店。只想在床上赖着。严重推荐,"The second time to stay, the first choice in Shanghai.Although there is no fame, the software and hardware facilities are very good.The big bed is too comfortable.Living in it, I don't want to go to the nightclub at night.I just want to rely on the bed.Serious recommendation"
1,酒店房间性价比高、干净、安全、服务人员素质高、周围吃饭地方多，真的挺不错。尤其是在我对定的房间不满意时给我免费调换了高级别的房间，让我很满意。,"Hotel rooms are cost -effective, clean, safe, high in service personnel, and there are many places around them. It is really good.Especially when I was dissatisfied with the Dingjian room, I changed me a high -level room for free, which made me very satisfied."
1,"还成,不错还成,不错还成,不错还成,不错,物有所值","It's better, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, good, it is worthwhile"
0,这是我入住的如家连锁里最差的，从一下几个方面说明：1、位置非常不好找，在一个破败的小巷里；2、当时到酒店已经很晚了，酒店服务人员的态度不好，官腔严重；3、拿到房卡后居然打不开门，只能在返回前台，让保安出面才解决问题；4、在走廊上时看到沿墙壁的地脚线全部裸露出墙体，一副很旧的样子，就跟80年代的招待所一样，就问保安怎么回事？保安说因为北京快开奥运会了，对宾馆设施要求较高，在重新装修，但根本看不出装修的迹象；5、我订的是商务大床房，床是大，但床的质量太差了，一坐下去床就陷了一个大坑，弹簧的声音噔噔的刺耳；6、隔音效果奇差，在卫生间洗澡时居然听到了隔壁房客的鼾声，注意是鼾声而不是呼噜声，把我吓坏了，洗澡时总感觉怕怕的；7、我是5月16日入住的，卫生间里发现了4只大花蚊子，被我拍死了3个，全是吸得饱饱的那种。,"This is the worst in the Rujia chain I stayed. From the following aspects, I explained: 1. The location is very difficult to find, in a dilapidated alley; 2. It was late to arrive at the hotel at that time.Not good, the official cavity is serious; 3. After getting the room card, you can't open the door. You can only return to the front desk and let the security guard come forward to solve the problem.A very old look, just like the guest house of the 1980s, asking what was going on with the security guard?The security guard said that because Beijing is about to open the Olympic Games, it has higher requirements for hotel facilities and renovation, but there is no signs of decoration at all; 5. I ordered a large business bed room. The bed is large, but the quality of the bed is too poor.When I sat down, I was caught in a big pit, the springs of the spring's sound; 6. The sound insulation effect was strange. When I took a bath in the bathroom, I heard the snoring of the tenants next door.I was frightened, I always felt scared when I took a bath; 7. I stayed in May 16th. I found 4 big flower mosquitoes in the bathroom. I was shot to death.Essence"
1,性价比较高的酒店，服务态度和房间的配套都不错，被褥都是特别的干净~就是地毯比较脏，有待提高,"The cost -effective hotel, the service attitude and the supporting facilities of the room are good, the bedding is particularly clean ~ The carpet is dirty, it needs to be improved"
0,三个字：脏、乱、差！房间里面看上去还可以，但是仔细看，很多地方极其脏，服务人员貌似没有培训上岗的，从前台到餐厅的服务人员都是这样，走廊上停着服务车，24小时没有换地方，四周环境乱得很，和照片完全不相符。饮食很差！,"Three words: dirty, messy, poor!It looks okay in the room, but if you look closely, many places are extremely dirty. The service staff seems to have no training. The service staff from the front desk to the restaurant are like this. The service car is parked in the corridor.It is very messy and does not match the photos at all.The diet is poor!"
1,以前去过大连，今年选择住在博览，总体感觉还是挺好的，就是住在这里的日本人挺多的，最讨厌小日本了。我个人习惯住酒店最在意的是卫生，尤其卫生间的卫生最重要，这里的卫生条件还是让人满意的，服务也不像说的那么不好，服务人员态度都很热情友好，有问题很快都得到解决，房间打扫也很及时，我住的房间视野比较好，可以看到大连美丽的夜景，下次去大连还决定住这家，不错不错补充点评2007年8月24日：另外值得一提的是，酒店地理位置不错，从这里到各大景点和购物区都有直达的公交车,"I used to go to Dalian before, and chose to live in the expo this year. The overall feeling is still very good, that is, there are a lot of Japanese people living here. I hate Little Japan the most.I am accustomed to living in the hotel most about hygiene, especially the hygiene in the bathroom. The sanitary conditions here are still satisfactory. The service is not as bad as saying. The service staff attitude is very enthusiastic and friendly.They are all solved, and the room cleaning is also very timely. The room I live in is better. You can see the beautiful night view of Dalian. The next time I go to Dalian, I decided to live in this house.It is mentioned that the hotel has a good location, from here to major attractions and shopping areas."
1,分为五栋单独的楼房，每个楼房住的级别是不一样的。我一开始是订的标准单人间，但是过去以后只有标准双人间了。服务一般，他们没有主动为客人升级，而是只给我了一间标准双人间。我自己改到了商务单人间，但烟味较重，而且还是被放在了我最不喜欢的上楼梯正对的第一间屋子。服务员还是比较热情的。,"It is divided into five separate buildings, and the level of each building is different.I was a standard single room at the beginning, but in the past, there were only standard doubles.The service is average. They did not take the initiative to upgrade the guests, but only gave me a standard double room.I changed to a business single in the business, but the smell of smoke was heavy, and I was still placed in the first house where I disliked up to the stairs.The waiter is still enthusiastic."
1,酒店的位置在闹市区，周围非常方便，就是稍微闹了点。房价还不错，繁简好像新装修过。值得推荐！,"The location of the hotel is in the downtown area, which is very convenient around, but it is a little bit troubled.House prices are not bad, and it seems that new decoration has been renovated.Recommended!"
0,"我是带孩子去的.电视画面一打开就是不堪入目的镜头.怕孩子乱摁,只有把遥控器藏起来.作为五星酒店怎么可以象街头旅馆?酒店应该反思一下.","I took my child. As soon as the TV screen was turned on, I was unsightly. I was afraid that the child was chaotic, and I only hid the remote control device. How can I look like a street hotel as a five -star hotel? The hotel should reflect on it."
1,"酒店在我最喜欢的跑马地区,是靠山的,很舒服,不到两分钟步行时间还可以到临近的百家国际超市,那里可以购买到全球各地的新鲜美食.^_^,扯远了,酒店房间就是小了一点,大家都知道的,香港寸土寸金啦,房间小一点是没有办法的,好在酒店周围环境幽雅,安静,酒店大堂很怀旧英式风格,还有免费巴士到地铁金钟站,价格也有竞争力,总的来说还是比较满意的.","The hotel in my favorite horse racing area is a backing, very comfortable. You can also go to the nearby Baijia International Supermarket in less than two minutes. You can buy fresh food from all over the world.The hotel room is a little smaller. Everyone knows that Hong Kong's inch is gold. There is no way to make the room smaller. Fortunately, the surrounding environment of the hotel is elegant, quiet, the hotel lobby is very nostalgic for British style, and there are free buses to subway gold.Zhongzhan, the price is also competitive, in general, it is relatively satisfactory."
0,正月初四带女儿入住横店国贸大厦，感觉很不好。一是旧。设施陈旧不堪，开水器脏兮兮的，还接触不良，烧水都害怕。空调虽然是中央空调，不能调风速，象拖拉机一样开到天亮。二是脏。地毯都不知道是什么颜色了，浴巾又黑又硬。三是不诚信。我是通过携程订的三人房，到酒店时房间还没打扫出来，这倒也正常，我们先进去洗把脸就外出游览景点了，洗脸时把自己带的毛巾和洗漱用品挂在了毛巾架上，结果酒店服务员就没给我们放三条毛巾。因为反正不会用，也没在意。第二天退房时，竟然问我们要三条破毛巾。更可气的是当天的服务员说确认放进去了的。我还耐着心致给她们解释，说要弄丢也不会三条都丢，除非我们偷了。这帮猪一样的服务员，实在太侮辱人格了。我留了电话，到现在还没接到酒店的道歉电话。,"On the fourth day of the first month, he took his daughter to stay in the Hengdian International Trade Building and felt very bad.The first is old.The facilities are old, the boiling water heater is dirty, and the contact is poor, and the water is scared.Although the air conditioner is a central air conditioner, the wind speed cannot be adjusted, like a tractor to dawn.The second is dirty.I don't know what color is the carpet, and the towel is dark and hard.The third is dishonesty.I was a three -person room ordered through Ctrip. When I arrived at the hotel, the room had not been cleaned up. This was normal. We went out to visit the attractions when we were washed.On the shelf, the hotel waiter did not put three towels for us.Because I can't use it anyway, I didn't care.When checking out the next day, we asked us to have three broken towels.What is even more annoying is that the waiter on the day said that it was confirmed to put it in.I also explained to them that I said that I would not lose all three, unless we stole it.These pig -like waiters are too insulting their personality.I left the phone, and I haven't received an apology call from the hotel yet."
1,"由于小孩怕震天响的炮仗声,我们每年都有大年夜和初四晚到宾馆过夜的习惯","Because children are afraid of the sound of artillery, we have the habit of going to the hotel overnight every year and the fourth night of the fourth night of the New Year and the fourth night."
1,"周边环境优美,交通便利.早餐种类较少,前台服务态度一般,如多一点热情微笑则更佳.","The surrounding environment is beautiful, convenient for transportation. There are fewer types of breakfast, and the service attitude of the front desk is average. If you smile a little more enthusiastic, it is better."
0,非常不好，强烈建议不要入住，几乎没什么服务！补充点评2008年2月23日：1，酒店倒是容易发现，但进去的路面坑坑洼洼地，不方便2，前台漫不经心地，不能使用信用卡3，电梯怀疑是货梯，绿色滴，声音大挺吓人4，客房的空调在酒店所谓的服务员（中年男人，没工作服）近一小时折腾下，又过了一小时才制热，但是出风口不到60度，根本吹不倒床，就在空调下一米见方处热，我事1月份住滴，实在撑不住，要了床被（客房内没备用被），中年男人耷拉着脸，老大不愿意。5，浴室的水，脸盆和淋浴好像患了前列腺，滴啦啦出来，等了半小时都不热！只刷了牙，澡都没法洗！6，周围几乎没吃东西滴。,"Very bad, it is strongly recommended not to check in, there is no service!Supplementary comment on February 23, 2008: 1. The hotel is easy to find, but the potholes on the road that enter the road is inconvenient to 2. The front desk is indifferent. You cannot use a credit card 3.The air conditioner of the rooms in the hotel's so -called waiter (middle -aged man, no work clothes) tossed for nearly an hour, and it took another hour to heat it, but the outlet was less than 60 degrees, and it could not be fell at all.When Mi saw the square, I lived in January. I couldn't hold it. I couldn't hold it. I asked the bed (there was no spare quilt in the room). The middle -aged man pulled his face and the boss was unwilling.5. The water in the bathroom, the washbasin and the shower seem to have a prostate.I only brushed my teeth, I couldn't wash it!6. There are almost no foods around."
1,总体比较满意。房间里最亮的灯是落地台灯，最好有日光灯。提供的早餐品种稍少，味道还可以。,"Overall satisfied.The brightest lamp in the room is the lamp, it is best to have a fluorescent lamp.The breakfast varieties are slightly less and the taste is okay."
0,还是不去的好，装修噪音大，离汽车站火车站比较近比较乱。,"It's better not to go, the decoration is noisy, and the railway station is closer to the bus station."
0,离市区远，浴池下水不畅，晚上外面施工，服务员态度恶劣，垃圾酒店,"Far away from the urban area, the bath is not smooth, the construction is under construction at night, the waiter has a bad attitude, and the garbage hotel"
1,地理位置不错，就是临街有点吵，其他都不错,"The geographical location is good, but the street is a bit noisy, everything else is good"

1,确实不错！地点较佳，海景房正对栈桥和小青岛，不出房门，不用挤在旅游人群中，就能欣赏怡人海景；早餐较丰富且环境好，相对其价格，性价比高；一楼咖啡吧的简餐价格不高，味道较好，份量足（特别是三明治、热狗），是住客和非住店游客解决简单一餐或作为点心的好选择；宾馆楼道里的点心较受欢迎，品种多，质量高，而且添加及时，深受孩子喜爱；就是床略小（指带一个孩子睡的话）。总之，总体感觉好，推荐入住。,"It's really good!The location is better. The sea view room is facing the trestle bridge and Xiaoqingdao. If you do n’t go out of the door, you can enjoy the pleasant sea view without squeezing it in the tourist crowd.The price of simple meals is not high, and the taste is better. It is sufficient (especially sandwiches, hot dogs). It is a good choice for residents and non -residential shop tourists to solve simple meals or as dim sum.Multi -quality, high quality, and timely additional, deeply loved by children; that is, the bed is slightly smaller (referring to a child to sleep).In short, the overall feels good, and I recommend checking in."
1,"很不错的酒店,可能是兰溪最好的酒店.只是位置离市中心远了点.看到了上海的旅游团也住这里.","Very good hotel, it may be the best hotel in Lanxi. It ’s just a bit far from the city center. Seeing that the tour group in Shanghai also lives here."
0,第一次入住也是最后一次入住！理由有4：1.携程网上自助早餐价格为20元，实际收取38元，酒店解释是网上价格没有更新。2.隔音效果极差，酒店5楼为KTV，我住在10楼，晚上能听得见唱歌声；3.厕所差，第一个房间因为厕所堵住换另一个房间，结果仍然是坏的，工程师修到近12点，才弄好，实在不敢想像这种酒店会出这种事情；4.服务态度差，给人一种冰冷的感觉。总之，这是我感觉最差的酒店！,"The first time to stay is the last time!The reason is 4: 1. 1. Ctrip's online buffet breakfast price is 20 yuan, and the actual collection is 38 yuan. The hotel explanation is that the online price is not updated.2. The sound insulation effect is very poor. The 5th floor of the hotel is KTV. I live on the 10th floor and I can hear the singing. 3. The toilet is poor.The engineer did not get it until nearly 12 o'clock. I couldn't imagine that such a hotel would happen to this kind of thing; 4. The service attitude was poor and giving a cold feeling.In short, this is the worst hotel I feel!"
0,"感觉非常不好,房间有霉味,设施太过陈旧,拧开水龙头,要等很久,才出热水","It feels very bad, the room has a moldy smell, the facilities are too old, and the faucet is unscrewed. It takes a long time to get hot water"
1,"东城是5星级的..可是在我看来里房间的感觉跟4星级差不多.我定的是典雅大床房,房间小了一点..不过服务还是曼好的跟香格里拉,喜来登一个档次,很亲切..","Dongcheng is a 5 -star .. In my opinion, the room feels similar to the 4 -star. I set a elegant and large bed room, the room is a little smaller .. But the service is still Manjo and Shangri -La., Very kind .."
0,地点实在太偏僻，设施有点破旧，浴帘霉成那样竟然还在使用。想要借用电吹风，可服务员说没有，原来其他房间都有安装电吹风，就是我住的标房B没有。这样最起码的服务都没有，还不如人家街头小旅馆！补充点评2007年4月16日：前台服务实在不怎么样，我进酒店的时候一大群前台服务员不知道在讨论什么，愣是没人理我。再说那个早餐，实在难以下咽，路边的早点肯定比它好吃。,"The location is too remote, the facilities are a bit dilapidated, and the shower curtain is still in use.If you want to borrow a hair dryer, the waiter said no. It turns out that there are hair dryers in other rooms, that is, the benchm room B where I live in.There is no such service at the minimum service. It is not as good as a small street hotel!Supplementary comment on April 16, 2007: The front desk service is not good. When I entered the hotel, a large group of front desk waiters did not know what they were discussing, and no one cared about me.Besides that breakfast, it is really difficult to swallow, and the early on the road must be delicious than it."
1,定的国庆长假3号、4号的房间，从上海过去还是比较方便的，沪宁高速苏州绕城高速出口，开到巴城下高速左转，一直开到头再左转就是湖滨南路了，往南一直开就可以看到酒店了，酒店在大上海高尔夫度假村里。可能因为是长假人多，我们早上11点不到拿到房间钥匙，可是前批客人用过的房间还没收拾过。打电话给服务中心才派人来。房间比较大，比一般的套间大，厨房设备还不错，有些装修因为时间长了有些旧或者脱落了。酒店外面环境是不错，非常安静！第一次打高尔夫练习场，满有意思的，价格也还可以。下次全家再去，度假好地方。唯一的不足，其他娱乐设施没有，吃饭不方便，我们开车开了10多分钟去吃早饭。,"The design of the 3rd and No. 4 of the National Day holiday is still more convenient from Shanghai. The Shanghai -Nanjing Expressway is exported to the high -speed exit of Suzhou Ringcheng, and turns left to the high speed down.You can see the hotel all the time, the hotel is in Greater Shanghai Golf Resort.Maybe because there are many holidays, we did not get the room key at 11 am, but the rooms used by the guests before have not been packed.Call the service center to send someone.The room is relatively large, larger than ordinary suite, and the kitchen equipment is good. Some decorations are old or fall off because of a long time.The outside of the hotel is good and very quiet!For the first time, the golf exercise field is full of interesting, and the price is okay.The whole family will go again next time, a good place for vacation.The only shortcomings, other entertainment facilities are not, and it is not convenient to eat. We drove for more than 10 minutes to eat breakfast."
0,我奉劝携程的网友不要住这家酒店，这是我亲身感受后的结论，我可以告诉你们事实：1。周边环境太差，我们是8月5日晚9点左右入住的，周边黑漆没有商铺，只有在酒店点餐，餐厅没人，找服务员，然后服务员再找餐厅师傅，我们才吃上，如果不在酒店吃，可以打的到大理古城，如果不打的，等着有酒店的往返古城的车，约半小时有一趟。2。房间陈设不干净，垃圾筒上没有垃圾袋，直接丢进去，拖鞋质量太差，最不好的是卫生纸，很黄很粗糙劣质的那种。3。你刚入住，酒店前台的几个女孩就会不厌其烦地问你明天的行程，给你推荐司机，或者帮你叫车。我们就是被他们坑了：当知道我们明天要从大理去昆明后，他们极力热情地给我们推荐他们的一个班车，要126元，比正常的客运票价贵40%，我的孩子9岁，1.3米，从丽江过来大理时买的半票，可这个酒店要我们去昆明买全票，说这是规定，我们就相信了，就付款了，可后来下午到了他们的那个旅游大巴站（云南旅游集团的旅游快车），站里的人说我们的孩子可以买半票，转头打电话到三塔苑酒店，希望帮忙解决换票、退票款，他们就没有当初的热情了，拖着找理由，不理，最后只有我们到时间了上车，车走了。4。这家酒店推荐的什么豪华大巴是云南省旅游集团的省旅高快，大家千万不能坐！大理的上车点在苍山饭店里，车上高速以后，车里的卫生间不让用，到了楚雄后，进了楚雄加油站旁边一个私人餐厅，说要休息半小时，一车的旅客都不愿意休息，因为快到昆明了，大家都想到昆明吃饭，可司机蛮横的一句：你们不吃，我还饿了呢，我要吃！最后一车旅客被赶下车在空地里站着，司机大摇大摆去吃饭，全体旅客等他们吃好，耽误了40多分钟，本来8点多一点可以到昆明的，拖到9点。,"I advise Ctrip's netizens not to stay in this hotel. This is the conclusion after I feel it. I can tell you the fact: 1.The surrounding environment is too bad. We stayed at around 9 pm on August 5th. There were no shops in the surrounding black paint. Only when you order at the hotel, no one was in the restaurant, the waiter was looking for the waiter, and the waiter would find the restaurant master.If you do n’t eat it in the hotel, you can go to the ancient city of Dali. If you do n’t hit it, you will have a car to and from the ancient city of the ancient city for about half an hour.2.The furnishings of the room are not clean. There are no garbage bags on the trash can. Throw it directly. The quality of the slippers is too poor. The worst is toilet paper, which is very yellow and rough.3.As soon as you stay in, several girls in the hotel's front desk will not tirelessly ask your journey tomorrow, recommend drivers to you, or call you a car.We were pitted by them: when we knew that we would go to Kunming from Dali tomorrow, they tried to recommend a bus that we recommended to us, which cost 126 yuan, 40%more expensive than normal passenger fares, my child is 9 years old, my child is 9 years old, my child is 9 years old, my child is 9 years old, my child is 9 years old, my child is 9 years old, and my child is 9 years old.1.3 meters, half of the ticket bought from Lijiang to Dali, but this hotel wants us to go to Kunming to buy a full vote. It is said that this is the regulation.The people at the station said that our children could buy half -tickets and turned to call Santayuan Hotel. I hope to help solve the ticket exchange and refund funds. They have no enthusiasm.In the end, we only got on the bus in the end, and the car left.4.What luxurious bus recommended in this hotel is the provincial tour of the Yunnan Provincial Tourism Group, everyone must not sit!Dali's boarding point is in the Cangshan Hotel. After the high speed on the car, the bathroom in the car is not used. After arriving at Chuxiong, I entered a private restaurant next to Chuxiong gas station and said that they would take half an hour.Rest, because I was about to come to Kunming, everyone thought of eating in Kunming, but the driver said very much: You do n’t eat, I am still hungry, I want to eat!The last car passengers were kicked off the car and stood in the open space. The driver shook a lot to eat. All the travelers waited for them to eat well. They delayed more than 40 minutes. Originally at 8 o'clock, they could reach Kunming at 9 o'clock."
1,标准房间设施一般，外部环境绝对一流！至少要提供暖风机之类的便民设施。补充点评2008年4月9日：之前点评有理，房间真的霉味很重，有待改进！,"Standard room facilities are average, and the external environment is absolutely first -class!At least to provide convenience facilities such as warm fans.Supplementary comment on April 9, 2008: The previous review is reasonable, the room is really moldy, and it needs to be improved!"
1,住的是258的阳光大床房，条件完全对得起这个价格，绝对的物超所值，酒店大环境很好，房间内的环境也很不错，入住赠送了水果，服务也很棒。缺点在于床稍微有点短，厕所有些小,"I live in a large sun room of 258. The conditions are completely worthy of this price. It is absolutely worthy of money. The hotel's environment is very good, the environment in the room is also very good, and the fruit is given away, and the service is great.The disadvantage is that the bed is slightly short, and the toilet is small."
0,"服务极差,价格高,地点环境偏,房间条件能有一星..","The service is extremely poor, the price is high, the location environment is biased, and the conditions of the room can have a star .."
1,房间不错，早餐也不错，就是上网不方便，自己设置了半天都不能上，叫服务员来看看，她只给了张IP地址的信息，还是上不了，折腾半天结果发现酒店把我房间里的网络线接错了，所以我才上不了！酒店在城东区，距离新长途站挺近，但是离市区尤其是火车站比较远――不过济源这地方火车也少！补充点评2007年6月14日：一进门就看到了那本“臭名昭著”的人体艺术，还好，密封封装得好好的……,"The room is good, and the breakfast is also good, but it is inconvenient to surf the Internet. I can't get it for a long time after setting up for a long time.The network line was wrong, so I couldn't get it!The hotel is in the east of the city, which is close to the new long -distance station, but it is far from the urban area, especially the railway station, but there are fewer trains in Jiyuan!Supplementary comment on June 14, 2007: As soon as I entered the door, I saw the ""infamous"" body art. Fortunately, the sealed packaging was well encapsulated ..."
1,到凤凰如不想住在江边的话，这酒店算是不错的选择，相当的安静。房间的装修有点旧，整体还算清洁。因为酒店比较大，我是给安排住在後座的5楼的房间，感觉有点远，因为电梯还在修建中！位置跟凤凰古城有点远，吃饭或到其它地方都需要打的。,"If the Phoenix does not want to live in the river, this hotel is a good choice and quite quiet.The decoration of the room is a bit old, and the whole is clean.Because the hotel is relatively large, I feel a bit far away for the room on the 5th floor of the back seat, because the elevator is still under construction!The location is a bit far from the ancient city of Phoenix, and you need to play or go to other places."
1,酒店地理位置距离南陀岛海洋浴场很近，服务质量优良，大堂的自助晚餐超值优惠，值得一去。房间设施舒适，宽敞。,"The hotel's geographical location is very close to the Nantu Island Ocean Bathroom, with excellent service quality. The lobby's buffet dinner is worth a preferential value.The room facilities are comfortable and spacious."
0,"中庸的酒店,本来冲着环保房去的,可是,哎,有些失望啊","The golden -mean -meter hotel originally went to environmental protection houses, but, hey, a little disappointed"
1,安静、干净，服务不错。下次还会考虑住这里。补充点评2006年9月19日：酒店的电脑是虚拟硬盘，我存了一些文件没想到重起就没了！后来发现有一个分区是可以保存文件的：）,"Quiet, clean, and good service.I will consider living here next time.Supplementary comment on September 19, 2006: The hotel's computer is a virtual hard disk. I saved some documents and did not expect to go again!Later, it was found that there was a partition that could save the file :)"
0,"一般我是懒的去评价住过的酒店的,这次选择""金泰海博"",是因为新公司就在对面,图个方便,但是,住过3天后,让我太失望了,我觉的不吐不快:1酒店正门在马路背面,第一次坐车去会习惯的开到马路旁边的前面,结果发现是一个杂草丛生的停车场!2我网上定的是一个大床无烟房,到前台一入住,告诉我没有了,给我一个没有地毯的标间,不得以,加了100多换成了豪华标间!3豪华标间在8楼,走廊超窄,最头紧靠的就是一个大会议室,早上还没起来,外面吵吵囔囔,3天都有不同的会议在进行!出门再一看,是个公厕!4比较晚起,下午4点叫服务员打扫房间,然后出去,晚上8点回来,整整4个多小时,居然房间没有打扫,想找人骂~~5因为靠近马路,晚上你就算把窗子关死,你也能听到外面车子嗖嗖的声音,比较吵!6我比较怕热,北京这些天也非常干燥热,可是到了晚上1点后,居然没有空调了,到了7点左右才开,TMD,他们晚上把空调都全关了~~开窗吵,不开窗热,你能怎么办,7服务员长的那叫一个眼泪啊!这点就无所谓了!","Generally, I am lazy to evaluate the hotel where I have lived. This time I chose ""Jin Tai Haibo"" because the new company is opposite. It is convenient for the picture. However, after 3 days of living, I disappointed me.Don't spit out: 1 The main entrance of the hotel is on the back of the road. When you take a car for the first time, you will get used to driving in front of the road next to the road. As a result, it is found that it is a weed parking lot!As soon as I got into the front desk, I told me that there was no more. Give me a standard room without a carpet. It was not possible. More than 100 was added to a luxury room! 3 Deluxe bids are on the 8th floor. The corridor is super narrow.It is a conference room. It hasn't got up in the morning and noisy outside. There are different meetings for 3 days! Go out and look at it again.Come back at 8 o'clock in the evening. For more than 4 hours, the room did not clean up. I wanted to find someone to scold ~~ 5 because you are close to the road. Even if you close the window at night, you can hear the sound of the car outside, making it more noisy!6 I am more afraid of heat, Beijing is also very dry these days, but after 1 o'clock in the evening, there is no air conditioner. It only turned around at about 7 o'clock. TMD, they opened the air conditioner at night.Opening the window, what can you do, the 7 waiter is called a tears! This does not matter!"
1,地理位置不错，紧挨老街，酒店外观很有特色，房间小，但是古色古香，早餐一般，可以接受，总的来说房间价格公道。如果毛巾和被褥质量好些就更好了。,"The geographical location is good. It is close to the old street. The appearance of the hotel is very distinctive. The room is small, but it is antique and average breakfast. It is acceptable. In general, the room price is fair.It would be better if the quality of towels and bedding is better."
1,酒店位置不错，房间也比较新的，在九华山区属于比较舒适和实惠的酒店，下次来还会考虑入住。,"The hotel location is good and the room is relatively new. It is a more comfortable and affordable hotel in the Jiuhua Mountain area. Next time, you will consider staying."
1,"我订的是贵宾楼标间(根据前人评语筛选),最大特点是服务细节考虑得很周到,送水果、晚报、餐巾盒，甚至连浴缸前的垫脚毛巾都铺好了。特别提示：因该酒店贵宾楼标间靠近马路，所以房间分双层隔音玻璃房和单层隔音玻璃房，如果你对于噪音比较敏感，建议预定双层隔音玻璃房。","I booked a VIP Tower standard room (screening according to predecessors). The biggest feature is that the details of the service are considered very thoughtful. Sending fruits, evening newspapers, napkins, and even the foot towels in front of the bathtub have been paved.Special reminder: Because the hotel's VIP building is close to the road, the room is divided into double -layer sound insulation glass rooms and single -layer sound insulation glass rooms. If you are more sensitive to noise, it is recommended to book a double -layer sound insulation glass room."
1,"这是一间非常不错的三星级酒店,房间设施和服务员的服务素质,态度等都很不错,不过就是携程的协议价格和酒店前台价格相差不是很多,希望携程还得继续努力.","This is a very good three -star hotel, room facilities and waiter's service quality, attitude, etc. are very good, but Ctrip's agreement price is not much different from the hotel's front desk price. I hope that Ctrip will continue to work hard."
1,"我们一家三口在岛上住了一天,总的感觉还不错.沙滩海水无得弹,很多珊湖石.在携程订观海木楼,山下几间房是看不到海的,一定要山上的才能观到海,有点遗憾.在岛上吃得还能接受,就是什么都要现金,另外晚上有很多小动物.","The family of three of our family stayed on the island for a day, and the general feeling was not bad. There was no bouncing beach and sea water. Many mountain lakes and stones.Only by looking at the sea, a little regrettable. Eating on the island is still acceptable, that is, everything requires cash. In addition, there are many small animals at night."
1,房间很大很舒适，服务也很好的，价格也是五星里面算便宜的,"The room is very comfortable, the service is also good, the price is also cheap in the five -star"
1,"7月10日入住的,因为酒店搞活动,所以原700多的房间只要498元.还是蛮合算的.地理位置不错.房间也不错.不过,如果按原价700多,有点贵了.总体还是满意的.","I stayed on July 10, because the hotel was engaged in activities, so the original 700 rooms only cost 498 yuan. It is quite cost -effective. The geographical location is good. The room is also good. However, if it is more than 700, it is a bit expensive. Overall is still satisfied with satisfaction.of."
0,为保护环境，第二天我没要求换床单等，但床还必须要整理好。他们只是草草搞了一下，皱巴巴的，实在达不到四星。二星还勉强。价格系统与国际惯例相差甚远。给我留下的印象这是一家黑店，能斩到一个就斩一个。希望其他要入住该酒店的客人要对其价格从各种渠道，各时间段认真核对，才下订单。如有必要可随时撤单，以免挨斩。,"In order to protect the environment, I did not ask for a sheet to change the sheets the next day, but the bed must be sorted out.They just got it for a while, and they couldn't reach the four stars.The two stars are barely.The price system is far from international practice.The impression left by me is a black shop, and one can be cut one.It is hoped that other guests who have to stay in the hotel will take the price from various channels and time periods to check them out before they place orders.If necessary, you can withdraw orders at any time to avoid cutting."
1,总算可以免费上网了～经过3年的营运，价格在不断攀升，硬件多少在退化，服务还是一如既往。呵呵，从性价比角度看有待商榷喽......补充点评2007年12月17日：房间内的温度是可以调节的，冬季里一般我都建议服务员给锁定在24度自动控制状态，没有那么干燥，感觉很舒服。,"Finally, it can be free to go online ~ After 3 years of operation, the price is rising, the hardware is degraded, and the service is still as usual.Hehe, from the perspective of cost -effectiveness, it is yet to be discussed ... Supplementary comment on December 17, 2007: The temperature in the room can be adjusted. In winter, I generally suggest that the waiter is locked in the automatic control status of 24 degrees.So dry and feel comfortable."
0,本来要订衢州酒店，临时告知满房，改到国际酒店。入住行政房，房间昏暗，潮气很重，而且有股子霉味，卫生间的毛巾也是脏兮兮泛着黄。。。床就更可怕，睡觉时感觉就像躺在了硬木板上面，翻身都不敢使劲，免得咯着自己的骨头，汗。。。。。。还有入住时酒店房间的窗户没关，但是窗帘是拉着的，当时因为太晚入住，第二天还要早起也没检查就睡觉了，整晚听到外面车水马龙的喧嚣汽笛声，强忍了一晚，第二天清晨才发现自己开着窗子睡了一整夜，一问同行的老板他也同样遭遇，再汗。。。。还有更恐怖的，就是跟前台要熨斗和熨衣板，被告知全酒店只有一套，我和同行的老板只能共用一套，老板等不及叫服务生帮忙把次日要穿的衬衫交给洗衣房晕，小姐改敲我的房门问我是否会晕衣服，如果可以能否帮忙给熨一下？瀑布汗阿。。。。。。。这什么酒店的服务生？居然能给我提出这么个建议？？？彻底败给他。。。宾馆反馈2008年6月5日：尊敬的客人您好，您的一翻话犹如一声响雷，给了我们很大的触动，也让我们更深刻的明白了100-1=0的服务内涵。在此，我们对由于我们工作不到位给您带来的不快向您表示慎重的道歉！并针对您提出的意见认真对照整改！但有一点我们床是按四星标准统一配置的，不知是否存着个例的现象，希望下次有机会能与您有更多、更直接的交流！,"Originally, I would like to order the Luzhou Hotel, to temporarily inform the full house and change to the international hotel.In the administrative house, the room was dim, the tide was very heavy, and it had a moldy smell. The bathroom towels were also dirty.EssenceEssenceThe bed is even more terrible. When I sleep, I feel like I was lying on the hard wood board. I didn't dare to work hard, so as not to hold my bones and sweat.EssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceThere is also the window of the hotel room when staying at the hotel, but the curtains were pulled. At that time, because I stayed too late, I went to bed before I got up early and did not check it.One night, the next morning, I found that I fell asleep all night when I opened the window. As soon as I asked the owner of the same peers, he also encountered the same and sweat again.EssenceEssenceEssenceThere is also more scary, that is, the iron and ironing board are required to be followed by the front desk.

If I could help iron it?Waterfall Khan.EssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceWhat hotel waiter?Can you actually give me such a suggestion?IntersectionIntersectionHe lost to him completely.EssenceEssenceHotel feedback on June 5, 2008: Dear guests, your words are like a thunder, giving us a lot of touch, and let us understand the service connotation of 100-1 = 0 more deeply.Here, we apologize to you with the unhappiness brought to you because we do not work in place!And carefully rectify the opinions you put forward!But there is a little configuration of our bed according to the four -star standard. I don't know if there is a phenomenon of examples. I hope that there will be a chance to have more and more direct exchanges with you next time!"
1,在香港难得有那么大的房间，不过就是卫生间旧了一点。对于去香港血拼的人来说这是最好的选择，因为酒店就在海港城内，偌大的海港城逛一星期估计也难以逛全，逛累了还可以直接到酒店歇一歇,"There are such large rooms in Hong Kong, but the bathroom is a bit old.This is the best choice for those who go to Hong Kong, because the hotel is in the harbor city. It is estimated that it is difficult to visit the huge Harbor City for a week."
1,刚过元旦，我就住进如家红照壁店，标准间不行，没有窗户。商务大床房挺不错的。装修简洁、房间舒适、被褥干净床垫柔软。洗手间用品齐全。服务态度也不错。作为休闲之所就算挺好的了。从酒店出来到商业街、小吃街、侯祠等景区，步行都不远。只是酒店提供的洗脸毛巾看上去颜色很没有个性，好像脏兮兮的。还有，在旅游淡季来说，189元/天在同类酒店中价格不便宜。房价应该弹性才对。,"As soon as I passed the New Year's Day, I lived in Rujiahong Zhaobi Store. The standard room was not good. There were no windows.The big business bed room is pretty good.The decoration is simple, the room is comfortable, and the bedding is soft.The toilet supplies are complete.The service attitude is also good.It's good to be a place of leisure.From the hotel to commercial streets, snack streets, Hou Temple and other scenic spots, walking is not far away.It's just that the facial washing towel provided by the hotel looks very colorful, as if dirty.In addition, in the off -season of tourism, the price of 189 yuan/day is not cheap in similar hotels.House prices should be elastic."
0,设施非常差，味道难闻，卫生恶劣，最糟糕的是还有色情电话打到客服问需要按摩服务吗？但是一听到是女性旅客就挂电话，让人觉得所谓的按摩是非正常的。实在想不通CTRIP怎么会推广这样的酒店，真是让人觉得要么酒店欺骗了CTRIP的考察组，要么就是CTRIP没有负责任，这么多年对CTRIP的信任一下荡然无存，大声呼吁取消对这家“脏店”的推广，避免更多的会员受到欺骗！！！！！！！！！！！！！！补充点评2008年7月17日：刚刚接到酒店高层的的致歉电话，态度非常诚恳，再三承诺将规范服务质量提高软硬件水平。由衷希望他们能言出必行，在举国欢庆奥运之际把富凯打造成名副其实的四星酒店，让国内外旅客快乐而至满意而归。,"The facilities are very poor, the taste is unpleasant, and the worst is the worst. Is there a porn phone call to the customer service to ask the massage service?But when he heard that female passengers hung up, people felt that the so -called massage was normal.I really don't think about how CTRIP promotes such a hotel? It really makes people feel that either the hotel has deceived the CTRIP inspection team, or CTRIP is not responsible.

The attitude is very sincere. It repeatedly promises to standardize the quality of the service to improve the level of software and hardware.I sincerely hope that they can say that they will become a veritable four -star hotel when they celebrate the Olympic Games, so that domestic and foreign tourists are happy and satisfied."
0,总体来说不怎么样的，进入当天需要门童帮助拿行李也是很不情愿的样子，服务员比你还要早就洗好澡了，在你对面的房间看电视。延住几天的卫生打扫也是很马虎，第二天觉得卫生间很臭还要请她们在你眼皮底下再打扫一遍。这家酒店是原来对内的招待所改建、扩大的所以很多酒店该有的实施基本上不具备的，出这个价很不值的！,"Generally speaking, it ’s very reluctant to help getting luggage on the day of entering the day. The waiter has taken a shower earlier than you, watching TV in the room opposite you.The hygienic cleaning that extends for a few days is also very sloppy. The next day, I feel that the bathroom is very stinky and ask them to clean it under your eyelids.This hotel was originally rebuilt and expanded to the internal guest house, so many hotels should be implemented basically. This price is not worth it!"
1,"装修前也住过几次,现在感觉完全不一样,非常不错的一家4星酒店,早餐也很丰盛,下次去嘉善还会考虑住,出来就是市中心,就是房间的隔音差了点,隔壁的电视声音也听得见,还有浴室的灯是感应式的,但感应范围好像不大广,人在浴缸基本感应不到,会熄灯...","I also lived several times before the decoration. Now I feel completely different. A very good 4 -star hotel, breakfast is also very rich. Next time I go to Jiashan, I will consider living. It is the city center, that is, the sound insulation of the room is a bit worse. Next doorThe sound of the TV can also be heard, and the bathroom lamp is induction, but the induction range does not seem to be wide. The basic sense of people in the bathtub will not be able to turn off the lights ..."
0,"推荐天目湖宾馆,各方面设置比这家好多了.值得推荐的是他们的餐厅还算过得去,鱼头还能吃吃.但是前台小姐的服务太差了。","It is recommended that Tianmu Lake Hotel, which is much better than this. It is worth recommending that their restaurant is still too much, and the fish head can still eat. But the service of the front desk lady is too bad."
1,出行非常方便，离地铁很近，酒店后面就有酒吧一条街，房间还不错没有想象中小，被子超软，很舒服！以后我还会住这里！,It is very convenient to travel. It is very close to the subway. There is a bar in the back of the hotel. The room is not bad. I do n’t think of small and small. The quilt is super soft and comfortable!I will live here in the future!
1,6月7、8住了2天，已经是第三次来住了，因为是政府办事处，让人感觉很安全，总的感觉还不错，房间卫生、服务态度很好，提的要求也能满足，就是没有纱窗，容易进苍蝇。虽然没有早餐，但门口的一个小店做的2元一个的卤蛋夹饼很好吃。明年我还会来住的,"I have lived for 2 days in June 7 and 8. It has been for the third time, because it is a government office, which makes people feel safe. The general feeling is good. The room is healthy and the service attitude is very good.Satisfaction is that there are no screens, and it is easy to enter the flies.Although there is no breakfast, a small shop at the door of the shop is delicious.I will live next year"
0,路边有点吵，而且房子结构很不合理，窗户很小而且居然贴近地板...空调有很重的味道，几乎不能忍，房间也很小。以后实在不想住这里了,"The roadside is a bit noisy, and the structure of the house is very unreasonable. The windows are small and are actually close to the floor ... The air conditioner has a heavy taste, almost unbearable, and the room is very small.I really don’t want to live here in the future"
0,从没见过如此残旧的五星级酒店，电梯、走廊、房间内铺设的地毯，可以用惨不忍睹来形容，电梯内的地毯块边缘起毛破烂，打个不好听的比喻，我们家用来垫狗屋的地毯块看起来都比它干净整齐，房间和走廊上的地毯给人感觉至少用了十年以上似的；卫生间里的墙面瓷砖一看就是低档得不行的东西，沟缝的白水泥开始出现一个个的小孔洞，象是蚂蚁窝的大门；水龙头和毛巾架铜锈斑驳、颜色可疑，洁具的牌子让人无从考究，倒是放洗澡香皂的香皂盒的牌子清清楚楚地显示是“COTTO”，这是什么等级的东西，相信对建材稍微有点了解的人都知道，卫生间的毛巾品牌不详，但是感觉又干又硬，似乎至少是三岁以上的年纪了，更可怕的是窗帘，上帝啊，我怀疑这酒店的窗帘是从来没有清洗过的，颜色晦涩不堪，我只是拉开并关上两次，洗手时居然肥皂泡就隐隐发黑，我住的是1520房间，似乎里面曾经淹过水，地毯颜色怪异不算，地脚线的木板很明显地不是同一次装上去的。本来这酒店大堂的服务还挺让我满意的，不管是登记还是入住服务员们的微笑都让我很开心，但是房间的服务就有点不知道怎么说好，我是下午四点左右入住的，在房间小睡了一个小时后才出去应酬，结果应酬完九点多回酒店时，赠送的水果已经放在酒吧台上了，而床，我起来时是什么样的，还是那么自然的乱成一团保持在那里，让我顿时象吞吃了个苍蝇似地倒了胃口，好感全消。而门口的保安及门童服务等管理，也是非常糟糕，门前广场是个圆圈，进来的的士在圆圈的任何位置都可以停下来上客下课，小小的入口经常是从各个角度分别停几量车在那里上下客，而酒店方也置之不理，根本没有人维持秩序，酒店门口打车也是一样，没有设置排队廊，大家全站在门口等车，前后左右那么一排开，实在是说不清楚先来后到的，不时有些因打车先后顺序而起的小纠纷！这酒店最大的特色就是销售，房间里随处可见卖东西的价目表和怂恿住可加入他们积分计划的推广牌，连文具和个人用品居然都有销售价目单竖在床头柜上，让我实在不知道这究竟是提供方便呢还是为了将销售最大化。而免费的东西，因为我出差习惯自己带洗漱用品，所以不知道他们的洗漱用品质量如何，但是那一次性拖鞋的质量，咳，难道是义乌小商品城那里购买的吗？啧啧，难得一见啊，赠送的水倒是怡宝的，但是怕吃亏似地加上了酒店的广告。该酒店停车场上来的电梯是在四川宾馆的门口，我入住时上来一出门口就看到登记台，过去登记得差不多完了才知道那是四川宾馆的前台，于是道个歉转过来假日酒店的前台重新办理了登记入住的手续，结果，咳，结果让我非常后悔应该在开始就将错错好了，据成都的朋友说，四川宾馆的硬件条件还略微好过皇冠假日，价格只是皇冠假日的一半而已，两家挨在一起并有门共通，这都是啥和啥呀？我已经是携程的钻石级会员，从来没有任何酒店做过任何评价，此次四川之行，先是在绵阳的富乐山九州国际酒店入住，精美得让我叹为观止，舒服得不行，因行程改变在成都临时住了这么一次皇冠假日，同是五星级酒店，让我感觉是从真正的五星级酒店一下子搬到了火车站的招待所，还比真正的五星级酒店多付了一倍的住宿费。赚钱不能就靠搞定些什么评选机构弄到五颗小星星后就那么黑心地赚啊！五星级的大车铺啊，永别了，我是再也不会去了，套用句流行词：赚钱，要厚道些！,"I have never seen such a disabled five -star hotel. The carpets laid in elevators, corridors, and rooms can be described as a terrible.The carpet block of the house looks cleaner and neat than it. The carpets in the room and the corridor feel that it has been used for at least ten years. The wall tiles in the bathroom are low -grade.Began to appear small holes, like the gate of ant nests; the faucet and towel rack copper rust and mottled, suspicious in color, and the brand of the sanitary ware made people unspeakable, but the sign of the soap box with a bath soap was clearly displayed as ""COTTO""What level of things are this? I believe everyone who knows a little bit of building materials knows that the towel brand in the bathroom is unknown, but it feels dry and hard. It seems to be at least three years old.Ah, I suspect that the curtain of this hotel has never been cleaned. The color is obscure. I just pulled it away and closed it twice. When I washed my hands, I was faintly black. I lived in Room 1520.Water, the color of the carpet is weird, and the wooden board on the ground line is obviously not installed on the same time.Originally, the service of this hotel lobby was quite satisfied. Whether it was registration or the smile of the waiters, I was very happy, but the service of the room was a bit good. I didn't know how to say. I stayed at around 4 pm.After a small sleep of the room, I went out to entertain. As a result, when I returned to the hotel nine o'clock at 9 o'clock, the fruits I presented were placed on the bar.There, I immediately swallowed my appetite like swallowing a fly, and my favor disappeared.The management of security and door children at the door is also very bad. The square in front of the door is a circle. The taxi who come in can stop at any position of the circle.The car is there, and the hotel is also ignored. No one maintains order at all. The same is true for the hotel at the entrance of the hotel. There is no queuing corridor. Everyone stands at the door and waits for the cars.From time to time, there are some small disputes that start in the order of taxi from time to time!The biggest feature of this hotel is sales. The price list of things selling things everywhere and encouraging the promotion cards that can join their points plan can be used.Is this convenient or to maximize sales.And free things, because I get used to it with my own toiletries, so I do n’t know how the quality of their washed products, but the quality of the one -time slippers, cough, was it bought at the small product city of Yiwu?Alas, it is rare to see it. The water given is Yibao, but I am afraid that it will add the hotel's advertisement.The elevator from the hotel's parking lot was at the door of the Sichuan Hotel. When I came up, I saw the registry at the door when I got in. I was almost done in the past.The front desk re -completed the procedures for registering and staying. As a result, cough, the result made me very regretful that I should be wrong at the beginning. According to friends from Chengdu, the hardware conditions of the Sichuan Hotel are still slightly better than the crown holiday. The price is just Crown Holiday Day.Just half, the two are together and have the same door together. What are these and what?I am already a Diamond -level member of Ctrip. I have never made any evaluations of any hotel. This trip to Sichuan first stayed at the Fuleshan Kyushu International Hotel in Mianyang.I temporarily lived in such a crown holiday, and the same five -star hotel, which made me feel that I moved from a real five -star hotel to the railway reception. I also paid doubled more than a real five -star hotel.fee.You ca n’t make money by making money. You can make it so dark after getting five little stars!Five -star big car shop, farewell, I will never go anymore. Set out of the sentence popular words: make money, to be more kind!"
1,服务不错，位置也比较方便，坐地铁、去虹桥机场都很方便。设施有点旧，隔音不好。房间还比较干净。,The service is good and the location is relatively convenient. It is very convenient to take the subway and go to Hongqiao Airport.The facilities are a bit old and the sound insulation is not good.The room is relatively clean.
1,长城酒店的外形很壮观。是嘉峪关里两家四星酒店之一。不过太陈旧了。优点1.离雄关广场走路10分钟。那吃饭、购物都很方便。2.毕竟是四星级酒店，房间设施还是比较齐全的。3.每天服务员都送两瓶热水到房间，另外还有一瓶凉的开水。挺温馨的。缺点1.卫生间手纸太糙了:(2.服务中心电话经常无人接听。不过，接听后响应速度还是很快的,"The appearance of the Great Wall Hotel is spectacular.It is one of the two four -star hotels in Jiayuguan.But too old.Advantages 1. Walking 10 minutes away from Xiongguan Plaza.It is convenient to eat and shop.2. After all, it is a four -star hotel, and the room facilities are relatively complete.3.

The price / performance ratio is still available, it is worth recommending. I have always been satisfied with the service of the coroutine."
1,因为离客户很近所以觉得非常方便，说实话房间没怎么注意过，因为一天中只有早上是比较清醒的，其他时候都醉着。早餐还不错，房间也挺干净。很可惜住了两天半很匆忙没去看看那个全市最大的冲浪游泳馆。,"Because it is very close to the customer, I feel very convenient. To be honest, the room has not been noticed, because only the morning is relatively sober in the morning, and it is drunk at other times.The breakfast is not bad, and the room is quite clean.It is a pity that I stayed in a hurry for two and a half days and did not go to see the city's largest surfing swimming pool."
1,当地最好的酒店！但是五星级酒店不是地方标准，所以在硬件一般的情况下，还得在服务上狠下功夫，向优秀的五星级饭店看齐。,"The best local hotel!However, five -star hotels are not local standards, so in the case of hardware, they have to work hard on the service and watch the excellent five -star hotels."
1,第一次用携程订这个酒店，还给了一点代价券，可以抵现金的，冲掉几十房费后，价格在4星级酒店里面来说是相当可以的了，这次住的新楼，比较安静。,"For the first time, order this hotel with Ctrip, and also give a little price coupon. If you can get the cash, after the tens of room fees can be reached, the price is quite available in the 4 -star hotel., Quietly."
0,时隔2年又住这家宾馆，当时给了4～5分的评价，可今天再也看不到2年前正在申请3星时的服务和环境了，服务员没了微笑，早餐没了品种，设施正在老化，失望啊。,"After 2 years, I lived in this hotel again. At that time, I gave a 4 to 5 points of evaluation, but today I never saw the service and environment when I was applying for 3 stars 2 years ago. The waiter has no smile.The facilities are aging and disappointed."
0,"去住的时候是考虑到拜访客户方便，因为离的很近。但一进房间，发现床单上有个鞋印。刚换好了，发现在电视机没有电源线。因为很晚了，也不想换了。那时的服务员好象没有培训过，换床单的时候还打打闹闹的。还要一男一女两个人换。晕。餐厅还不错，饭菜也不错。招待客户在那还是可以的。宾馆反馈2008年7月18日：非常感谢您选择常熟凯悦国际酒店作为下榻场所!您的宝贵意见我酒店非常重视,已对当班人员作出严肃处理,同时加强对全体员工的星级服务培训.并真诚希望你能再次选择我酒店入住.我们将以全新的面貌为您提供优质的服务.","When going to live, it is considering the convenience of visiting customers, because it is very close.But as soon as I entered the room, I found a shoe print on the sheets.Just changed it and found that there was no power cord on the TV.Because it's very late, I don't want to change it anymore.At that time, the waiter didn't seem to have trained, and when he changed the sheets, he was still making trouble.Also, one man, one woman and two people change.faint.The restaurant is not bad, and the meals are also good.It is still possible to entertain customers there.Hotel feedback on July 18, 2008: Thank you very much for choosing Changshu Hyatt International Hotel as a place to stay!

0,酒店的怪味根本无法忍受，设施也不方便，全然不是如家的风格，住了一晚就迫不及待地逃跑了，若不是酒店不肯退当天的钱，我连这一晚也决不会呆。,"The strange smell of the hotel was unbearable at all, and the facilities were not convenient. It was not the style of the family. After staying for one night, I couldn't wait to run away. If it wasn't for the hotel to refund the money on the day, I would never stay in this night."
1,非常宽大的房间，非常宽大的床，足有1.5米，非常宽大的卫生间，去云台山只有12公里，自驾车住中州宾馆是最好的了。,"A very wide room, a very wide bed, 1.5 meters in a full, very wide bathroom. It is only 12 kilometers to go to Yundai Mountain. It is the best to drive in the Zhongzhou Hotel by car."

1,去郑州好几次，都在这里住。有一次免升，住大堂左侧一层的房间。酒店很安静，服务也好。前台小姐虽然不漂亮但服务很到位。退房速度极快。下飞机来酒店时免费班车，退房后去机场要付费。下次来就住这里。,"Go to Zhengzhou several times and live here.There was no rise, living in the room on the left side of the lobby.The hotel is quiet and the service is good.Although the front desk lady is not beautiful, the service is in place.The check -out speed is extremely fast.When you get off the plane to the hotel, free shuttle bus, and pay for the airport after checkout.Live here next time."
0,3楼是ktv，很吵；前台服务一般，退房时还莫名其妙有了99的国外长途费，房间内没有宽带，有个adsl猫，他,"The 3rd floor is KTV, which is very noisy; the front desk service is average, and there are 99 foreign long -distance expenses when checking out. There is no broadband in the room. There is an ADSL cat. He"
0,酒店服务非常差，设备一般，加床是硬板床且收费很高，服务员态度很差，就像没有经过培训，业务也不熟练，根本不像三星级的酒店。,"The hotel service is very poor, the equipment is average, the bed is a hard bed and a high fee, the waiter has a poor attitude, just like it has not been trained and the business is not skilled. It is not like a three -star hotel at all."
1,这次到莫干山自驾游，住在德清县的这个酒店里。先说说好的方面，酒店的地理位置不错，紧邻免费开放的春晖公园。开车到莫干山有两条路，大约40分钟。作为挂牌四星级，门面还是很气派，客房是中式的布置，房间很大。酒店内的工作人员对客人有求必应，服务态度较好，就连门口指挥车辆的保安也会很热情地给我们指路。不太满意的地方，一、酒店大堂因为节能不开空调，走廊里有因长期不通风造成的霉味，而且地毯看上去也很脏；二、浴室热水比较小，但设施还算干净；三、入住和结账的速度比较慢，但也可能是因为入住客人多的原因。德清县环境不错，离杭州、湖州都比较近，酒店还有班车发往这两个城市，适合短途旅行。,"This time I went to Mogan Mountain to travel by car and live in this hotel in Deqing County.Let's talk about good aspects first, the hotel's geographical location is good, close to the free and open Chunhui Park.There are two ways to drive to Mogan Mountain for about 40 minutes.As a four -star list, the facade is still very elegant. The rooms are Chinese -style, and the rooms are large.The staff in the hotel have a good response to the guests, and the service attitude is better. Even the security guards who command the vehicle at the door will be enthusiastic to point us.Where is not very satisfied, the hotel lobby does not turn on the air conditioner because of energy saving, and there is a moldy smell caused by long -term non -ventilation in the corridor, and the carpet looks dirty; second, the bathroom hot water is relatively small, but the facilities are clean;Third, the speed of staying and checkout is relatively slow, but it may also be due to the many guests.The environment of Deqing County is good, and it is closer to Hangzhou and Huzhou. The hotel also has a shuttle bus to these two cities, which is suitable for short -distance travel."
1,"房间设施比较陈旧,特别是电视机比较老,遥控器一直不好用,虽然经过服务员修理但是还是不太好用,服务态度还可以,大堂很气派,但是房间感觉没有四星的标准,房间内也没有食物,很不方便,需要的时候要给服务员打电话,时间较久,但是江景很美,交通确实不很方便","The room facilities are relatively old, especially the television is relatively old. The remote control has been difficult to use. Although it is repaired by the waiter, it is still not easy to use. The service attitude is okay. The lobby is very elegant.There is no food, it is very inconvenient. When you need it, you have to call the waiter. It takes a long time, but the Jiangjing is beautiful and the traffic is not very convenient."
1,宾馆的地理位置有点偏，整体环境不错，宾馆设施不算很新但是蛮干净的，房间还提供台式电脑可以免费上网。机场到宾馆打车议价30元左右。打车到市中心10元左右。到北戴河打车议价45元左右。附近有公交车25路可以到第一关。,"The geographical location of the hotel is a bit biased, the overall environment is good, and the hotel facilities are not very new but quite clean. The room also provides desktop computers to access the Internet for free.The price of a taxi from the airport to the hotel was about 30 yuan.Taxi to the city center is about 10 yuan.The price of a taxi at Beidaihe is about 45 yuan.There are bus 25 nearby to reach the first level."
1,酒店刚刚装修好时我就去住过，时隔一年，已经显得有些旧了，可能维护不够。服务人员态度很好，不过硬件是差一点儿。在郑州这种地方不算是便宜了。早餐不够丰富。,"I went to live when the hotel was repaired. After a year, it seemed a bit old and might not maintain enough maintenance.The service staff attitude is very good, but the hardware is a little bit.It is not cheap in Zhengzhou.Breakfast is not rich enough."
0,"酒店不管是外观还是内部设施都已经落后了,提醒一下,酒店2007年装修,那只是10-14层,恐怕携程的客人是无缘入住了.其实地理位置也一般,虽然步行15分钟到步行街,但每天的往返还不如住在附近.总之,488的价格太不值了.","Both the hotel's appearance and internal facilities are already backward. Remind that the hotel was decorated in 2007, it was only 10-14 floors, I am afraid that Ctrip's guests have no chance to stay in. In fact, the geographical location is also average. Although walking for 15 minutes to the pedestrian street, it is walking on the pedestrian street, but it is walking to the pedestrian street, but it is walking to the pedestrian street, but it is walking to the pedestrian street, but it is walking to the pedestrian street, but it is walking to the pedestrian street, but it is on the pedestrian street, but it is walking to the pedestrian street.It's better to live nearby every day. In short, the price of 488 is too worthless."
1,好！！当时看到有人评价说什么骚扰电话多，我还心有余悸呢，结果好的不得了吗哪里有电话？我们自己人打电话，总台还会仔细核对身份呢而且房间也好服务也非常的好真的是徐州最号的酒店！,"good!IntersectionAt that time, I saw some people commented on what harassment phone calls, and I still have a lingering heart. Is there any call?We call by ourselves, and the main station will check our identities carefully, and the room is good for the room. It is really the most popular hotel in Xuzhou!"
0,"可能是酒店比较老的缘故,房间看起来很一般,设施也比较一般.","It may be because the hotel is older, the room looks very average, and the facilities are relatively average."
1,打电话到酒店问路，总机说不知道，转礼宾部，几个小伙也不熟悉，连东向西向也分不清，不过总算说了个标志性建筑，让我有了方向。问商务中心买份地图让送上来，居然说礼宾部忙，在替别的客人下行李，要等半小时。等就等吧，但足足等了一个半小时，还是电话催了才送的。房间还算干净，但卫生间小的转不过身。退房时落东西了，服务员查房也没发现，还是自己发觉了打电话回总台再查才找到的。总体来说在吉林能住到这样的酒店还不错，但价格一点也不便宜。无论硬件还是服务都是四星的标准。,"I called the hotel to ask the road. The headproke said that I did n’t know. I was not familiar with a few guys, and I could n’t tell even the westward direction. However, I finally said that I had an iconic building that gave me a direction.Ask the Business Center to buy a map for sending it, and actually said that the Ritual Department was busy and waited for half an hour to get the luggage for other guests.Wait, wait, but after waiting for an hour and a half, I was sent by the phone.The room is quite clean, but the bathroom is small.When I got out of the room, I did not find that the waiter's inspection room did not find it. I still found out that I called back to the head station before I found it.Generally speaking, it is not bad to stay in such a hotel in Jilin, but the price is not cheap at all.Both hardware and service are the standards of four -star."
1,酒店位置离火车站很近，走路10分钟不到就能到。。。服务不错，有送果篮，但是部分水果有点烂烂的。。。我觉得既然要送，就送好一点的，不然干脆就别送了。。。酒店整体不错，房间也很好。。,"The hotel location is very close to the train station, and it can arrive in less than 10 minutes by walking.EssenceEssenceThe service is good, there are fruit baskets, but some fruits are a bit rotten.EssenceEssenceI think that since I want to send it, I will give it better, otherwise don't send it.EssenceEssenceThe hotel is good as a whole, and the room is very good.Essence"
1,前前后后住了好多次，位置方便，周边有很多吃饭的地方。就是房间有点小。,"I have lived many times before and after, and the location is convenient. There are many places to eat around.The room is a bit small."
1,因为要去高新园区，图个方便，门口交通还不错，有轨道交通。商务旅行，网络能让人满意。早餐令人失望，没啥吃的。还有最近似乎涨价了。,"Because it is convenient to go to the high -tech park, the picture is convenient, the traffic at the door is not bad, and there is rail transit.Business travel, the Internet can make people satisfied.Breakfast is disappointed and has nothing to eat.There seems to be price increase recently."
0,酒店环境与照片完全不一样，而且设施也比较旧了，服务也不怎么好。,"The hotel environment is completely different from photos, and the facilities are relatively old and the service is not very good."
1,"酒店环境很不错,服务也很好,前台的接待很亲切,连每一个遇到的清洁工都会主动和你说""你好"",很好的感觉.我的房间在20楼的高级湖景房,景色也真的不错.唯一的遗憾是酒店的空调只出风不制冷.我入住的时间是4.4~4.6,没空调真的有点热!补充点评2008年4月7日：还有,酒店的免费接送机服务也是我选择入住的原因之一!省时省心!好!","The hotel environment is very good, the service is also very good, the reception on the front desk is very kind, and even the cleaner you encounter will take the initiative to tell you ""hello"", very good. My room is in the high -end lake view room on the 20th floor.The scenery is really good. The only regret is that the hotel's air conditioner is only out of the wind and refrigerate. The time for me to stay is 4.4 ~ 4.6, and there is no air conditioner. It is really a bit hot! Supplementary reviews on April 7, 2008: Also, the hotel’sFree pick -up machine service is also one of the reasons I choose to check in! Save time and worry! OK!"
0,大家都说平湖君悦酒店床铺太小，很不幸我中招了，我是预订完了之后才看到大家评价的。这家酒店的内部设施偏老，早餐不好吃，房间有点小，设施还算全，卫生间也很旧！补充点评2008年6月3日：我建议大家在平湖多走走，比君悦酒店性价比高的宾馆多得是！,"Everyone said that the beds of the Junyue Hotel in Pinghu were too small. Unfortunately, I was recruited. I saw everyone evaluated after I booked it.The internal facilities of this hotel are old, breakfast is not delicious, the room is a bit small, the facilities are quite complete, and the bathroom is very old!Supplementary comment on June 3, 2008: I suggest everyone walking more in Pinghu, more cost -effective than Junyue Hotel!"
0,评价说得花好稻好，也就是一个偏僻的小酒店，酒店规模十分小，房间勉强可以，但是窗口对面不到5米就是破旧的居民楼，这个性价比好像也太差了些。几乎付了5星级豪华酒店的价格（定的是商务套房），实在性价比不高。宾馆反馈2008年6月3日：尊敬的客人，感谢您对星逸酒店提出的宝贵意见。星逸酒店是国家旅游局核定的四星精品商务酒店。我们希望通过最优质的服务让您再次体验到细致入微、彰显尊贵的感受。,"The evaluation is that it is good to spend good rice, which is a remote small hotel. The hotel size is very small and the room is barely.Almost the price of 5 -star luxury hotels (the business suite is determined), which is really cost -effective.Hotel feedback on June 3, 2008: Dear guests, thank you for your valuable opinions on Xingyi Hotel.Xingyi Hotel is a four -star boutique business hotel approved by the National Tourism Administration.We hope to let you experience the meticulous and honorable feelings through the best service."
1,"房间保养不错.前台服务也算不错.房间送餐服务非常好,味道也很地道.","The room maintenance is good. The front desk service is also good. The room delivery service is very good, and the taste is also authentic."
1,还可以，楼下餐厅的东西一点也不贵，可以挂房费，,"Okay, the restaurant downstairs is not expensive at all. You can hang up the house."
0,"该酒店虽然价格不高,但服务实在太差,房间例行送的水果和报纸要打电话问才送过来,早餐结束的时间被提前到9点也没有任何通知,最可气的是我投诉没早餐时,前台还不肯承认错误,骗我早餐在我下楼之前刚结束,是我自己下楼晚了.这种服务的四星级酒店我还从来没住过.","Although the hotel is not high, the service is too bad. The fruits and newspapers given by the room will be called before they are delivered. The breakfast is at the end of the breakfast to 9 o'clock.When I had no breakfast, I refused to admit the mistake at the front desk. I cheated me for breakfast just before I went downstairs. I was late for myself. I have never lived in a four -star hotel for this kind of service."
1,酒店设计古色古香，很喜欢外面的花园，位置于相当方便，十分近苍山门。早餐还可以，款式不少，服务亦称心。,"The hotel is designed with antique incense, and I like the garden outside. It is quite convenient and close to Cangshan Gate.Breakfast is okay, there are many styles, and services are also known."
1,已经住过几次这家酒店，感觉非常好。服务员态度友善，又够专业，客房的装设时尚、舒适，配套设施齐全，使用起来很方便。总之，来郑州，住索菲特是个很好的选择。,"I have lived a few times this hotel and feels very good.The waiter is friendly and professional enough. The rooms of the rooms are fashionable, comfortable, complete facilities, and are convenient to use.In short, coming to Zhengzhou, living in Sophot is a good choice."
1,很一般的酒店，因为定不到赣电了勉强入住下吧,"Very ordinary hotel, because you can barely stay in Gan Dian"
1,已经是第二次来仙湖酒店，感觉没有上次好了。这次住的是438的豪华房，生态游套票。酒店房间住的算是最好的了，还是觉得旧，不舒适。游泳池不错。早餐实在差。去农庄滑草还是很好玩的。祈福轩的中餐味道好，价钱也不贵。,"It was the second time I came to Xianhu Hotel, and I felt that I didn't last.This time I lived in the luxury room of 438, ecological toupers.The hotel room is the best, but I still feel old and uncomfortable.The swimming pool is good.Breakfast is really bad.It is very fun to go to the farm.The Chinese food in praying is good and the price is not expensive."
0,酒店位置就在火车站对面，车流密集，环境也很嘈杂，不适合女士前往。入住时，要注明住贵宾楼的，房间装修稍微好点。另外，服务人员的效率比较慢，不能太心急。,"The hotel location is opposite the railway station. The traffic is dense and the environment is very noisy. It is not suitable for women to go.When you stay in, you must indicate the VIP building, and the room decoration is slightly better.In addition, the efficiency of the service staff is relatively slow and should not be too anxious."
1,在当地绝对算不错的了，处在市中心，地理条件绝佳！交通非常便利！餐厅的德州扒鸡不错@,"The local area is definitely good, in the city center, the geographical conditions are excellent!Transportation is very convenient!The restaurant's Texas picking chicken is good@"
0,这个旅馆没有餐厅，服务员让我们到他们的4公里外的天天福饭店吃饭，结果我们被宰了耶。再去入住者千万别受骗上当啊。补充点评2007年11月24日：这个小旅馆非常差呀，你们千万不要再去入住这个酒店啊，虽然很远就能看见了在房子上的招牌，但到了房前转了3圈也找不到进入的小门，还被警察以违反交通处罚了。好容易到了房子前，一看是一片乱地，到处是建筑垃圾，车无法进入，无处停放轿车。这个旅馆没有餐厅，出去走了1000米也不能找到吃饭的地方，到处是大商场和购物商店。房间内的设施陈旧的很耶，白色的毛巾已经变了黄色也不更换，毛巾的四周都是线了，甚至还破了几个洞仍在给我们擦脸耶，一想就恶心死了。携程怎么还能将这种民工都不去住的小旅馆给我们推荐，太不负责任了吧。赶快从定房目录中删除掉。,"There is no restaurant in this hotel. The waiter asked us to eat at the Daily Fu Hotel 4 kilometers away. As a result, we were slaughtered.Do not be deceived again.Supplementary reviews November 24, 2007: This small hotel is very bad. Do n’t check in this hotel again. Although you can see the signboard on the house far away, you can find 3 laps in front of the house and find it.The small door that entered was also punished by the police for violation of traffic.It's easy to get in front of the house. At first glance, it was chaotic. There were construction garbage everywhere.There is no restaurant in this hotel. I can't find a place for meals after walking out for 1,000 meters. There are large shopping malls and shopping stores.The facilities in the room are very old. The white towels have changed yellow and they are not replaced. The towels are around, and even a few holes are still wiping our faces for us.How can Ctrip be recommended to us in a small hotel where this kind of migrant worker does not live, it is too irresponsible.Hurry up and delete it from the fixed -room directory."
1,该酒店环境和服务还有待提高，总体性价比还算挺高！,"The hotel's environment and services need to be improved, and the overall cost performance is quite high!"
1,"哈哈哈哈.....居然还可以继续评论啊那就给满分了下次去了继续住忘记说了,有房内按摸的服务的可惜没时间去试了,下次去还会住的......","Hahahaha ..... I can continue to comment on it, then I will go to the full score and continue to live and forget to say. Unfortunately, I have no time to try the service in the house. I will live next time.... ..."
1,环境很好，早餐也不错，服务一般般，房间设施一般般。不满意的一点是对携程预订的，喜欢安排在位置不太好的房间，这好像已成许多宾馆的通病了^o^，携程的公关部门需要加强。,"The environment is very good, the breakfast is also good, the service is general, and the room facilities are general.The unsatisfactory point is to book Ctrip and like to arrange in a room with a good location. This seems to have become a common problem in many hotels.^O^, Ctrip's public relations department needs to strengthen."
1,"这次去香港之前,我们就在携程上找酒店,后来定了朗豪酒店,因为看到对它的评价挺高的,入住后才发现真的很不错!前台和服务员态度都很好,CHECKIN和CHECKOUT的速度也快,整个酒店的装修很时尚,特别是房间卫生间的设计很前卫,非常喜欢!而且酒店地理位置也很好,交通十分方便,酒店直通对面的朗豪坊,下面就可以直接到达地铁站,去哪里都非常方便!酒店附近就是波鞋街,女人街,电器街,逛街也方便,下次去香港还住朗豪酒店!","Before going to Hong Kong this time, we went to Ctrip to find a hotel. Later, we set up the Ralai Hotel. Because I saw the evaluation of it very high, I found that it was really good after staying! The front desk and the waiter were very good.The speed of Checkout is also fast. The decoration of the entire hotel is very fashionable, especially the design of the bathroom in the room is avant -garde, I like it very much! And the hotel's geographical location is very good, the transportation is very convenient.It is very convenient to go to the subway station! Near the hotel is Bo Shoe Street, Women's Street, Electrical Street, shopping is also convenient. Next time I go to Hong Kong to stay in Langham Hotel!"
1,"大当办理入住和离店时间慢.工作人员服务差.意识也差,根本不管客人是不是派队的.宾馆反馈2008年8月4日：非常感谢您能选择入住我们饭店，也非常感谢您的意见和建议。就您所提到的问题，我们已经责成相关部门进行了改进。针对携程客人，我们特别开设了一条“绿色贵宾通道”，凡是在入住或退房高峰期，请您随时与我们的大堂副理或行李员联系，他们将协助您优先办理相关手续。再次感谢您的点评，衷心期待您的再次光临。","Dangdang is slow to check in and leave the store.

1,服人度良好安不人商物中心步行10分,"Good people's good people, no human business center walking 10 points"
0,尼斯酒店的几大特点：噪音大、环境差、配置低、服务效率低。如：1、隔壁歌厅的声音闹至午夜3点许、凌晨6时起又“享受”健身操场噪音；窗户破旧不隔音。2、电视无港、澳、凤凰、英文.....等台。3、前台服务人员少（2名），在早餐前已交房卡要求结算，待早餐后仍未算出来，无任何消费，而且只有我们在结帐，住店的客人极少。如此四星？少见。建议与“凯莱酒店”(尼斯附近)签约（全国连锁），价格也实惠。,"Several characteristics of the Nice Hotel: large noise, poor environment, low configuration, and low service efficiency.Such as: 1. The sound of the song hall next door is noisy until 3 o'clock in the middle of the night, and the noise of the fitness playground will be ""enjoyed"" from 6 am; the windows are dilapidated and sound insulation.2. There are no Hong Kong, Australia, Phoenix, English ..... Waiting for Taiwan.3. There are fewer service staff (2) at the front desk. The house card has been handed over before breakfast. It has not been calculated after breakfast. There is no consumption, and only we are at the checkout. There are very few guests in the store.So four stars?Rarely.It is recommended to sign a contract with ""Kaile Hotel"" (near Nice), and the price is also affordable."
1,每次到常州都是住这个酒店，各方面条件都不错！以后还会一直住在这里。要说缺点那么就是房间内的电视遥控器不够灵敏，面盆的水龙头设计不合理了。,"Every time I arrive in Changzhou, I live in this hotel, and all aspects are good!I will always live here in the future.The disadvantage is that the TV remote control in the room is not sensitive enough, and the faucet design of the basin is unreasonable."
0,千万不要相信酒店宣传的什么“环保”！！房间的味道非常重！如果你愿意不断地上楼下楼和总台交涉换房的话，可以考虑。,"Never believe what ""environmental protection"" promoted in the hotel!IntersectionThe taste of the room is very heavy!If you are willing to go upstairs and downstairs and negotiate and change the house, you can consider it."
0,索发票提供不及时，交涉时服务员态度不好！浪费电话费！,"The invoicing invoices are not timely, and the waiter's attitude is not good when negotiating!Waste phone bills!"
0,"房间很小,早餐应当是九点结束,但八点三刻左右餐厅内还有近二十人坐着时","The room is very small. The breakfast should end at nine o'clock, but there are nearly 20 people in the restaurant at about 8.3."
1,济南最好的酒店，服务也不错,"The best hotel in Jinan, the service is also good"
1,"该店的环境出乎我的意料,楼道里是有鼓很难闻的气味,早饭也不是很好,我就没吃.但是房间比较干净,我住得是单人房,网速也蛮快的,房间插头没欧式的,本人建议有电脑的朋友带个欧式过去.离王府井也就十来分钟的路程挺方便的.","The environment of the store is out of my expectation. There is a unpleasant smell in the corridor, and the breakfast is not very good. I didn't eat it. But the room was relatively clean. I lived in a single room.In the room, there are no European -style plugs. I recommend that friends with computer have a European style. It is convenient for ten minutes to get from Wangfujing."
1,"不错,变成常驻京酒店了,就是餐厅的餐太贵","Yes, it has become a resident hotel, that is, the meal of the restaurant is too expensive"
0,差的不能在差了，厕所垃圾桶旁边发现一只3厘米的蟑螂，床单被罩有血迹，打电话让换，服务员来了竟然说是刚换的，血迹是洗不掉的。,The difference cannot be worse. A 3 -centimeter cockroach was found next to the toilet trash bin. The sheets were covered with blood stains. They called to change. The waiter came and said that it was just changed.

1,"房间比较新,面积还算可以的,也很安静.关于前台服务:现在通过CTRIP预订是免上网费和正常服务洗衣费,但打单子出来就要客人付款,被质疑之后推脱为工作失误,该事已经有人在这里点评过,又被我碰到,因此可以怀疑其诚信.","The room is relatively new, the area is okay, and it is very quiet. Regarding the front desk service: Now the CTRIP booking is free of internet fees and normal service laundry fees, but if you call the list, you have to pay for the guest.

1,开车从成都到西安，中间边走边逛，在广元住了一天。在gps的帮助下，很容易就找到了广元国际大酒店。从楼道到客房，很多地方都让人感觉很舒适周到。楼道的拐弯茶几的烟灰缸上居然还放着火柴。走廊两边的墙上，挂着当地风景名胜的照片和水墨山水画，不是仿制品。房间很宽敞，得有3、40平米。迎面是落地的飘窗。大床看着就很舒服，而且，居然配了一白一粉两双拖鞋。抽屉里有介绍四川旅游的杂志。躺在床上，边翻杂志，边打免费长途，真舒服。第二天早上起来，拉开窗帘，外面是现成的山水美景。迎面是一排青山，山下流淌着一条据说是嘉陵江支流的大河。酒店就在距离河岸不远的地方。在一楼的餐厅用餐时，向左看窗外是城市的楼房街道，向右看却是一片青山绿水。真是个好地方。强烈建议驴友们以后来成都中途在这里落脚。,"Drive from Chengdu to Xi'an, walking around in the middle, living in Guangyuan for a day.With the help of GPS, it is easy to find Guangyuan International Hotel.From the corridor to the guest room, many places make people feel comfortable and thoughtful.There is still a match on the ashtray of the corner coffee table in the corridor.On the walls on both sides of the corridor, photos of local scenery and ink landscape paintings are not imitation.The room is very spacious, with 3,40 square meters.On the face is a bay window on the ground.The big bed looks very comfortable, and it is actually equipped with one white, one powder, two pairs of slippers.There is a magazine introduced in the drawer.Lying on the bed, turning around the magazine, it is really comfortable while playing for free long distances.Get up the next morning and open the curtains. The outside is the ready -made landscape.On the face is a row of green mountains, and there is a river that is said to be the tributary of the Jialing River under the mountain.The hotel is not far from the river bank.When dining on the restaurant on the first floor, look at the streets of the city outside the window, but to the right is a green mountain and green water.It's a good place.It is strongly recommended that donkey friends come here to settle here in the future."
0,"房间里的硬件设施还可以,周围环境太吵,早上不好打车.主要是前台的服务非常不好,Checkin的时间很长,办离店的时候也很费劲,说什么房间里的地毯有新烧了一个洞,但对天发誓我连火柴都没碰一下,也不会抽烟.让人感觉非常的不舒服,订房时的价格时不含早餐的,但结帐时却非说我们订了早餐,,,,真是让人感觉糟透了..这样的服务永远不会去第二次.","The hardware facilities in the room are okay. The surrounding environment is too noisy. It is not good to take a taxi in the morning. The main reason is that the front desk service is very bad. Checkin is very long time.I burned a hole, but I vowed to swear that I didn't even touch the match, and I would not smoke. It makes people feel very uncomfortable. The price does not contain breakfast at the time of reservation, but when I check outBreakfast ,,,,, really make people feel bad .. Such services will never go to the second time."

1,"交通不便,自己没车的话比较麻烦,而且周围吃饭的地方很少很少......","If the traffic is inconvenient, it is more troublesome if you have no car, and there are very few places to eat around ..."
1,说实话觉得比官房要好，房间不错，卫生间有个玻璃窗，虽说打不开，但感觉很好。,"To be honest, I feel better than the official room, the room is good, and there is a glass window in the bathroom. Although it can't be opened, it feels good."
0,"订的是豪华标准间,房间里的霉味让人简直不能呼吸,好在服务台给换了一个房,虽然霉味还是有,但比第一间好了很多.这,难道就是传说中的豪华标间?","The luxury standard room is booked. The mold smell in the room makes people breathe. Fortunately, the service desk is changed to a room. Although there is still a mildew, it is much better than the first room.Luxury Bidding Room?"
1,交通方便，周边也热闹，房间小在香港那是自然的了，总的说来是物有所值了。,"The transportation is convenient, and the surrounding area is also lively. The room is small in Hong Kong. It is generally worth speaking."
1,总的来讲还是不错的，但相对五星级标准房间过小了，服务还算可以，周边的环境一般，只是对于城市人来说还是比较新鲜的。,"In general, it is still good, but it is too small than the five -star standard room, and the service is okay. The surrounding environment is generally fresh."
0,房间的风景挺不错，望出去就是条古运河，很有古诗词意韵。但房间里的淋浴设施不好，淋浴门关不紧，水龙头出水很小，洗澡很不舒服。电视有两个遥控器，用起来很不方便。最主要前台小姐服务很不好，冷冰冰的，尤其是那个脸蛋胖胖的小姐，脸上象涂过糨糊一样，一点没有微笑。我去CHECKIN和CHECKOUT的时候，感觉很不舒服。感觉服务生的培训有待加强，服务意识太差！！！,"The scenery of the room is pretty good. Looking out is the ancient canal, which has the charm of ancient poems.However, the shower facilities in the room are not good, the shower door is not close, the water faucet is small, and the bathing is very uncomfortable.There are two remote controls on TV, which is inconvenient to use.The most important front desk lady has a bad service, cold, especially the fat lady with a fat face. She has no smile on her face.When I went to checkin and Checkout, I felt uncomfortable.Feeling the training of the waiter needs to be strengthened, the service awareness is too poor!IntersectionIntersection"

1,"各方面的硬件都不错，只可惜这么冷的天气房间没有暖气，有点冻！宾馆反馈2008年4月14日：让您受冻，酒店深表歉意，我们酒店有取暖器提供,在您入住期间，如有任何问题，请致电酒店大堂经理（电话52），由其做相应处理。","The hardware in all aspects is good, but unfortunately such a cold weather room has no heating, a bit frozen!Hotel feedback on April 14, 2008: Let you be frozen, the hotel is deeply apologized.

1,硬件还好，配有电脑可以游戏上网。但毕竟是山上的酒店，卫生条件不是很好，墙角有蜘蛛网。位置有点偏，进出不是很方便。总体来说在庐山还算个可以的酒店吧。,"The hardware is okay, equipped with a computer to play the Internet.But after all, it is a hotel on the mountain. The sanitary conditions are not very good, and there are spider webs in the corner.The location is a bit biased, and it is not very convenient to enter and exit.Overall in Lushan, there is a good hotel."
0,"房间临街，隔音很差，加上外面施工，吵得很！房间门锁似乎有故障，插入门卡显示绿灯但就是打不开，服务员的门卡插进去马上就好了。由于只在携程定了1天，临时有事要加一天，前台办理时不爽快，第二天总是催问何时退房，很烦。宾馆反馈2008年5月20日：您好,给您的住宿带来不便,酒店向您表示诚挚的歉意!您提到的问题,酒店都已作了改进和跟踪,并将尽最大努力减少影响您入住行程的小问题.并请您继续给予我们信任和支持!酒店周边的施工问题,我们已经进行了协商,夜间施工将得到有效的控制,我们一定会用如家真诚的服务理念,为您提供更好的服务.","The room is near the street, and the sound insulation is very poor.

0,酒店外观环境还好！进去后，一切都变得很杂！可能是娱乐场所太方便了，进进出出都是小姐与妈咪之类的（晚上七八点钟），后面的发廊液态夸张了点吧？绝对不能让太太们以为我们常住这种酒店！酒店中午和早上的时间环境还可以！酒店房间楼层还算可以吧？但是开着门打牌的房客使到整个走廊烟味很重！而且进出房间楼层的人也很多，感觉有点不很安全。,"The appearance environment of the hotel is okay!After entering, everything becomes mixed!It may be that the entertainment venue is too convenient. It is all like ladies and moms (seven or eight o'clock in the evening). The liquid liquid in the back is exaggerated?Master must not let our wives think that we live in such hotels!The time and environment of the hotel at noon and the morning!The hotel room floor is okay?But the tenants who opened the door to make the card made the whole corridor's smoke smell very heavy!And there are many people entering and leaving the room floor, and it feels a bit not safe."
1,"酒店服不,所浴室最正,自助早餐富,免享用泳池及健身室,只是酒店的地位置欠佳,建於工,什行街地方,只有坐酒店到常平火站,再到市行街,如果酒店有提供交通指示,即是坐什到什地方,就更好了,不是每人都有,及坐那些天的白牌的。","The hotel service is not, the bathroom is the most positive, the self -service breakfast is rich, and the swimming pool and the fitness room are avoided. It is just that the location of the hotel is not good.If the hotel provides traffic instructions, it is better to sit in what place, not everyone has it, and sit in those days."
0,不建议大家住该酒店，我就是没有看网上点评，入住后很窝火。,"It is not recommended that you stay in the hotel. I just did not watch online reviews. After check -in, I was very hot."
1,还可以，我住的标间368元，卫生间很大，设施比较齐全，热水器有的，床虽然不是大床但是软硬刚好合适，睡了个好觉。但有按摩小姐打骚扰电话，不过也属正常。,"Okay, the standard room I live in is 368 yuan, the bathroom is very large, the facilities are relatively complete, and there are water heaters. Although the bed is not a large bed, it is just soft and hard. I sleep well.However, there are ladies of massage making harassment calls, but it is normal."
0,"我在预定时要求房间一定要安静,但还是给了我一间靠马路的房间,并对我的要求挂断电话,我对这个四星的号称没有冬天的酒店很失望.同样是在携程订的武汉酒店,我只是要求楼层高一点,酒店没办法达到我的要求,携程主动联系我,和我解释,我心情很愉快的接受了.所以环境不是主要,服务才是王道啊!","I asked the room to be quiet when I was scheduled, but I still gave me a room that rely on the road and hung up the phone for my request. I was disappointed with the hotel that claims to be in this four -star.In the Wuhan Hotel, I just asked the floor to be a little higher. The hotel could not meet my requirements. Ctrip took the initiative to contact me and explained to me. I was very happy to accept it. So the environment is not the main, and the service is king!"
1,前台服务挺热情的，周围交通也还方便。只是酒店卫生间相临的地毯潮湿，有点发霉。但是价格便宜，性价比还过得去。,"The front desk service is very enthusiastic, and the surrounding traffic is also convenient.It's just that the carpet of the hotel's bathroom is wet and moldy.But the price is cheap, and the cost performance is still possible."
1,大堂不怎么样，可房间住得很舒服。最满意的地方是酒店的大堂副理和客服人员，对顾客的要求可以及时，尽心尽力的去完成。让人有家的感觉。借此感谢一下他们。,"The lobby is not very good, but the room is very comfortable.The most satisfactory place is the deputy manager and customer service staff of the hotel. The requirements for customers can be completed in a timely manner.It makes people feel at home.Thanks to them."
1,房间还不错，古典而又现代！前台服务一般，基本见不着笑容！地理位置还不错，尤其是喜欢数码产品的年轻人！,"The room is not bad, classical and modern!The front desk service is average, and you can't see a smile!The geographical location is not bad, especially young people who like digital products!"
1,整体看还行，只是相对这个价位，酒店提供的服务还不够。早餐太简易。所谓的湖景不湖景的根本没有区别，因为看不到。,"The overall perspective is OK, but the service provided by the hotel is not enough.Breakfast is too simple.There is no difference in the so -called lake scenes, because it cannot be seen."
1,环境好，在公园内，300元的价格也不贵。用餐一般，还是出去吃，在聚福林吃了两餐，真好。,"The environment is good. In the park, the price of 300 yuan is not expensive.It ’s nice to go out for dining and go out to eat two meals in Julin."
0,可以说是比较差的一个酒店，酒店走道昏暗，走道和房间内都有一股浓浓的霉味，床单看上去摸上去也是不很干净的，卫生间味道更难闻，里面的设施也是发霉的。最恼人的是晚上楼下的KTV的音乐声，难以入睡。,"It can be said that it is a relatively poor hotel. The hotel walkway is dim. There is a strong mildew in the aisle and the room. The sheets look not very clean. The taste of the bathroom is even more unpleasant, and the facilities inside are moldy.The most annoying is the music of KTV downstairs at night, which is difficult to fall asleep."
1,酒店的设施稍显陈旧，但优质贴心的服务弥补了这次不足，前台入住及退房服务很迅捷有效，很赞。check-in的时候旁边有位客人在抽烟，我被呛了一下，前台马上问我是不是对烟味敏感并立即打电话对我的房间进行无烟处理。酒店送的小苹果很好吃，烟台苹果名不虚传啊。由于所定房间只含单早，叫餐厅把早餐送了上来，量不多但搭配还过得去。车子要经过一个陡坡才能开进酒店后面的停车场，挺悬的，而且停车场对着厨房的大抽油烟机出口，很怕车子熏一晚上油烟的，建议能改进停车场地。,"The hotel's facilities are slightly old, but high -quality and intimate services make up for this shortcoming. The front desk staying and check -up services are very fast and effective.When check-in, there was a guest from smoking. I was stunned. The front desk immediately asked me if I was sensitive to the smell of smoke and immediately called my room to smoke.The little apple sent by the hotel is delicious, and Yantai apples are well -known.Because the final room contains only a single early, the restaurant is called the restaurant to send the breakfast, and the amount is not large but the match is still.The car must pass through a steep slope to drive into the parking lot behind the hotel. It is quite suspended, and the parking lot is exported to the large range hood in the kitchen. It is afraid that the car will smoke the oil fume for one night. It is recommended to improve the parking lot."
1,酒店环境不错，不过饭店什么的很贵，稍稍消费就要1000元左右。江景房的视野开阔，很漂亮。他们有的是室外泳池，有2-3个池，很大，很干净，后悔没有带泳裤。,"The hotel environment is good, but the hotel is very expensive. It costs about 1,000 yuan for a little consumption.The vision of Jiangjingfang is wide and beautiful.Some of them are outdoor pools with 2-3 pools, which are very large and clean. I regret not bringing swimming trunks."
1,"八月初入住两天,感觉极好.幽雅的庭院式格局与众多的现代高楼酒店相比,给人一种苏州园林式的恬静与悠闲.服务快捷且有求必应.地处闹市却静如田园.喜欢酒吧的出门左手数步HARRIS'BAR晚间十点以后热闹非常,有菲籍BAND演奏.饮食与购物天堂仅一街之隔.通过携程订房有送雪碧及可乐各一.早餐质差,68元价无所值.酒店周围美食多多,可尽情享受.强力推荐!","Two days in the early August, it feels very good. The elegant courtyard format is compared with many modern high -rise hotels, giving a kind of tranquility and leisure in Suzhou garden -style. The service is fast and the demand must be.The left hand of the bar is very lively after 10 o'clock in the evening after 10 o'clock in the evening, with the Philippine BAND performance. The diet and shopping paradise are only separated by one street. Through Ctrip booking, there are Sprite and Cola one.It's worthless. There are a lot of food around the hotel, you can enjoy it. Strong recommendation!"
1,1.非常安静，客厅听不到一点杂音，连老妈都说上海还有这样的房间！2.服务人员素质好。我印象中上海服务员总是扑克脸爱理不理的，她们让我改变对上海酒店的看法。房间两室两卫一厅。很适合全家住。3.楼下有小超市，东东挺多的。总之，上海3天很开心。4.唯一的缺点：中饭晚饭不能算入房费中宾馆反馈2008年8月5日：非常感谢您的评价！欢迎您和家人再次光临！,"1. Very quiet, I can't hear a noise in the living room. Even my mother said that there are still such a room in Shanghai!2. Good quality of service personnel.In my impression, Shanghai waiters are always ignorant of poker faces, and they let me change their views on Shanghai Hotel.The two bedrooms and two guards in the room.It is very suitable for the whole family to live.3. There is a small supermarket downstairs, and there are a lot of stuff.In short, Shanghai is very happy for 3 days.4. The only disadvantage: Chinese meal and dinner cannot be counted as the housing fee. Chinese Hotel feedback on August 5, 2008: Thank you very much for your evaluation!Welcome you and your family to come again!"
1,"酒店的服务不错,给人亲切感.很适合一家人度假.如果喜欢放风筝的人记得一定要带上它,酒店前的大草坪可是免费的哦!坐在沙发上一边看书一边喝杯下午茶还能晒到太阳真的是很惬意的事.阳台真的是很大很舒服,洗好的衣服还可以晾在阳台上.如够套房能够含两份早餐的话那就更好.","The hotel's service is good, giving a sense of intimacy. It is very suitable for a family vacation. If people who like to fly a kite must remember to bring it, the large lawn in front of the hotel is free! Sitting on the sofa while reading a book while drinking a glass of tea teaIt is really very pleasant to expose the sun. The balcony is really very comfortable, and you can also dry it on the balcony. If the suite can contain two breakfast, it is better."
1,看不出与5星酒店有多大关系，有虚的成分。50元的早餐，完全的名不副实，我看撑死值30元。,"I can't see much about it with the 5 -star hotel.50 yuan breakfast, completely name is not true, I think the dead value is 30 yuan."
0,地段还不错，但作为一家4星级宾馆，设施方面实在是不敢恭维。主要问题在卫生间。我住的是标间，可能其它房间会好一点。卫生间实在是太小了，打开门在里面转个身都困难，从来没看到过这么小的卫生间。其它地方倒也还好。但就这一点，我想我以后是不会去住了。当然好的地方也是有的，自助餐还不错，内容比较丰富，味道也不错，特别是那个什么虾。,"The location is not bad, but as a 4 -star hotel, the facilities are really dare not compliment.The main problem lies in the bathroom.I live in the standard room, and maybe other rooms may be better.The bathroom is too small. It is difficult to turn the door to turn inside. I have never seen such a small bathroom.It is okay elsewhere.But this point, I think I will not live in the future.Of course, there are also good places. The buffet is good, the content is relatively rich, and the taste is good, especially what shrimp."
0,"救命呀，遇到黑店了,房间小而且脏呀,服务态度也差(员工都是上海人，没有客人的时候保安,前台服务员都坐在一起聊天),天拉!怎么给推荐这种酒店呀!","Help, I met the black shop, the room was small and dirty, and the service attitude was poor (the employees were from Shanghai, and the security guards were when there were no guests."""
1,虽然说是四星的，实际上比某些号称五星的强很多，占地面积非常大，分三个大区，酒店整体上也算豪华，设施什么的都很好，靠海边就是舒服，视野好，价格上没什么优势，不便宜也不算太贵，餐厅的自助餐还不错，算便宜的。,"Although it is a four -star, it is actually much stronger than some of the five -star, covering a very large area. It is divided into three large areas. The hotel is also luxurious. The facilities are very good.Okay, there is no advantage in the price. It is not cheap and not too expensive. The buffet of the restaurant is not bad, which is cheap."
0,"这个如家实在是太小了,房间很小很小,就不舒服了","This home is too small, the room is very small, so I feel uncomfortable."
0,应该是一个教会的附属招待所吧．房间一般，床很硬，不舒适，最糟糕的是夜晚非常嘈杂，因为窗外的半山路上很多人在飙车，令人难以入睡．前台服务态度一般，较冷淡．一楼餐厅服务迟缓，一些老头作服务生，脸色苍白，而且也是面无表情，仿佛感觉象是来到阴间吃饭，挺恐怖的．一千多元也不便宜啦．下次肯定不会去住了．,"It should be a church's affiliated guest house.The room is general, the bed is very hard, uncomfortable, the worst is that the night is very noisy, because many people on the half mountain road outside the window are racing, which is difficult to fall asleep.The service attitude of the front desk is average, and it is relatively cold.The dining room on the first floor is slow. Some old men are waiters, with pale faces, and they are expressionless, as if they feel like they come to the yin to eat, which is very scary.It is not cheap for more than a thousand yuan.I will definitely not live next time."
0,房间设施太旧、太差，环境也不好，房间大而无用。非常不喜欢,"The room facilities are too old, too bad, the environment is not good, and the room is large and useless.I don't like it very much"
1,"房间设施不错,隔音也很好,是疲惫的我美美的睡了一觉,我已经很久没有睡的那么好了,服务也不错,我要的是送餐服务,由于忘了点咖啡,致使服务员跑了两次态度很好,房间的咖啡机不会使,说明的不清楚,总的来说还是不错的.","The room facilities are good, and the sound insulation is also very good. It is tired and I sleep beautifully. I have n’t slept as well for a long time, and the service is good. I want meals. Because I forgot some coffee, the waiter made the waiter.I have a good attitude twice, the coffee machine in the room will not make it, it means that it is unclear, in general, it is still good."
1,房间还不错，够大也够舒适（住的是豪华间），服务需要进一步改进，离店居然没人给叫出租车，就没见者门童,"The room is not bad, it is big enough and comfortable (living in luxury room). The service needs to be further improved. No one leaves the store called a taxi."
1,"酒店位置在罗湖万象城附近一栋大楼里，很不起眼。但是酒店内部装修很温馨，很不错。服务也体贴到位。早上出去，我扔在写字台上的电脑线，服务员也帮我整理好。唯一的缺点就是没有VIEW,窗外没什么风景。适合情人度假和商务旅行出差。","The hotel is located in a building near Luohu Vientiane City and is inconspicuous.But the interior of the hotel is very warm and good.The service is also considerate.When I went out in the morning, I threw it on the computer line on the office, and the waiter helped me sort it out.The only disadvantage is that there is no view and there is no scenery outside the window.Suitable for lovers and business trips."
1,比较满意，房间很干净，不过卫生间的水龙头有漏水现象。还有点遗憾的是前台接待有个女（30多的样子）的态度一般，不知道是不是那天客人比较多的缘故。,"It is relatively satisfactory, the room is very clean, but the faucet in the bathroom has water leakage.It is a bit regrettable that the attitude of a woman (more than 30) at the front desk is average. I do n’t know if it ’s because there are more guests that day."
1,因为有了去年的经验，去之前我和酒店联系了一下，得知相比豪华商务间还是标准间相对安静，所以在携程更改了订单，携程方面处理得很快，马上和我取得了联系并了解了情况。酒店比我想象中要好，挺宽敞、挺干净的，服务人员素质不错。标间一大床、一小床，空调用的果然是大金，效果不错，噪音几乎没有，房间里的宽带是免费的，不过我不知道怎么连接：P值得一提的是房间还有跳窗：）另外，房间隔音还好，就是走廊来往的人声很吵，不过我凌晨2点睡下的，没影响。旁边有景江大厨不过我没去，就不评价了。关于交通方面，由于我是退房前电话叫的士的，所以没遇到什么不便。总之，270块钱能住成这样已经很满足了。,"Because with the experience of last year, I contacted the hotel before I went. I learned that compared with the luxury business room, the standard room was relatively quiet, so I changed the order in Ctrip.Understand the situation.The hotel is better than I imagined. It is spacious and clean, and the quality of the service personnel is good.There is a large bed and a small bed in the standard room. The air conditioning is really golden, the effect is good, there is almost no noise. The broadband in the room is free, but I don’t know how to connect.Window :) In addition, the sound insulation of the room is okay, that is, the voices of the corridor are very noisy, but I sleep at 2 am and it has no effect.There was a chef Jingjiang next to me, but I didn't go, so I won't evaluate it.Regarding traffic, because I was a taxi call before checking out, I didn't encounter any inconvenience.In short, 270 yuan can be satisfied."
1,我是今天退房的502的客人，非常感谢酒店昨天的服务和对本人的照顾和关心，由于昨天午餐吃坏了肚子，下午从医院回来时，前台服务看我脸色不好，并且看到我手上还留有打点滴的胶带和酒精棉球，就很关心的问我是不是不舒服，需要他们什么帮助，并且在我回到房间后，酒店餐厅部经理（负责人）打电话问候，并且在晚上和服务员一起亲自送来了热热的稀饭和小菜，以及水果，服务员也来帮忙烧水，再三嘱咐我如有需要请及时联络他们，这些让出差在异地的我感到异常的温暖，觉得自己不在孤独，真的非常感谢酒店的工作人员，谢谢你们！！,"I am a 502 guest who checks out today. Thank you very much for the hotel's service and care and care for myself. Since the lunch was broken yesterday, when I came back from the hospital in the afternoon, the front desk service looked at my face was not good, and I saw me.There are also tapes and alcohol cotton balls in my hand, I care about whether I am uncomfortable, what help is needed, and after I returned to the room, the hotel and restaurant department manager (person in charge) called to greet it, andIn the evening, I personally sent hot porridge and side dishes, as well as fruits, and the waiter to help burn water. I told me to contact them in time if necessary.I am not lonely, I really thank the hotel staff, thank you!Intersection"
0,"通过携程定的每晚240元标间，性价比真的比较差。一、酒店通道和房间的异味特别浓烈，晚上久久无法入睡。二、房间设施过于简易，淋浴的水流特别小，在家洗澡的时间等于在酒店洗头发的时间。房间没有吹风机,洗好头发后需要向客服借用(客服竟然说全酒店只有2个吹风机,已经都借出去了没有了～)三、早晨起床后，发现洗漱间的水都是热水，孩子无法忍受热水索性就没洗漱。四、早餐一般也无所谓，服务生只负责撤盘子不负责换台布，台布很脏吃的倒胃口。第二天立刻换了酒店。","Through Ctrip's 240 yuan bidding room per night, the price / performance ratio is really worse.First, the odor of the hotel channel and the room is particularly strong, and it cannot fall asleep for a long time in the evening.Second, the room facilities are too simple, and the water flow of the shower is particularly small.There is no hair dryer in the room. After washing your hair, you need to borrow from customer service (customer service said that there are only 2 hair dryers in the hotel, and you have borrowed it.) Three, after getting up in the morning, found that the water in the washing room was hot water.I couldn't wash the hot water without washing.4. Breakfast is generally indifferent. The waiter is only responsible for withdrawing the disk and not responsible for changing the tablet. The tablet is dirty.I changed the hotel immediately the next day."
1,住了一次，还算可以。不过携程的房间一向不好,"Living once, it's okay.But Ctrip's room has always been bad"
0,9/11因出差住过，酒店太差了，最糟的是酒店环境，旁边没有一家商店或饭店，旁边是一个不运营的火车站，马路上都是灰，不时有驴车经过，从酒店内部装修看根本不是06年开业，至少开业也有10几年了，地毯其脏，卫生间没有独立淋浴房，只是用浴帘拉一下，洗澡水会蔓延到整个卫生间，毛巾也旧得不敢用，第一天的洗澡水很冷，大约水温30度都不足，同事的房间蟋蟀叫了两晚，房费中含的早餐更是差，总共品种大约只有六七个，粥里找不到几粒米，只能喝粥汤水，其余的东西都冷掉了（我们起得并不晚，是7：30吃的早饭），想吃个小馒头，又冷得硬梆梆的，我的另一个同事拿了个盘子兜了一圈又放回去了，真是差到不想吃。可以说这个酒店唯一可能还尚可的是服务了。,"9/11 Due to a business trip, the hotel is too bad. The worst is the hotel environment. There is no shop or restaurant next to it. Next to it is a non -operating railway station.The interior decoration is not opened in 2006. At least 10 years have been opened. The carpets are dirty, and the bathroom does not have an independent shower room. It just pulls it with the shower curtain. The bath water will spread to the entire bathroom.The bath water on the first day was very cold, and the water temperature was insufficient by about 30 degrees. The colleagues' room was called for two nights. The breakfast contained in the room fee was even worse. There were about six or seven varieties.Mi, you can only drink porridge soup, the rest of the things are cold (we do n’t get up late, it is a breakfast for 7:30), I want to eat a small steamed bun, and it ’s cold and hard.The colleague took a plate and put it back. It was so bad that I didn't want to eat it.It can be said that the only one may still be service in this hotel."
1,我为国外客户预订了三个房间，其中一个客人住过该酒店，虽然酒店设施都有不同层次的提高，但他提出服务水平已经不如一年以前，评定：硬件4星，服务3星,"I booked three rooms for foreign customers. One of the guests has lived in the hotel. Although the hotel facilities have improved different levels, he proposed that the service level is not as good as one year ago. Assessing: hardware 4 stars, 3 stars in service"
0,有幸住过一次，因为是和老板一起，所以当然想住的好一点。主要有以下几点缺陷，请朋友们千万不要去住。1，酒店不能刷visa卡，因为随行有一个老外，最后只好由我买单；2，我们是8点到的，居然已经不能点餐了，害得我们只好在外面吃的垃圾饭；3，服务超级差，明明知道三楼装修，还把我们安排在三楼，破破烂烂的像贫民窟。我老板虽然没有说什么，但是我真的很难过定了这么一家酒店，我对携程也很有意见。,"Fortunately, I lived once, because I was with the boss, so of course I wanted to live better.There are mainly the following defects. Please do not live.1. The hotel cannot swipe the VISA card, because there is a foreigner at accompanied by me, and finally I have to pay it by me.Super poor, knowing the decoration on the third floor, and arranging us on the third floor, like a tattered slum.Although my boss didn't say anything, I was really sad to set up such a hotel, and I also had opinions on Ctrip."
0,从去年开始，我上广州都住这酒店，开始感觉还不错，地点好，吃住方便，缺点是卫生间太小；后来就越来越差，12月这次尤为不爽：晚上睡觉，隔壁房间客人在洗澡水声特大，那声音就像隔壁在装修；酒店餐厅服务态度极差，可能是我们是拿了住酒店送的早餐券，部长的脸色象欠她钱似的，点了一份最普通的拉肠，等了半个钟头还没上，最后不吃走人；前台的态度也不好，从头到尾没见一个笑容，下次肯定不住这里。,"Since last year, I have lived in this hotel in Guangzhou. I started to feel pretty good. The location is good, convenient to eat and live, and the disadvantage is that the bathroom is too small; later it is getting worse and worse. This time in December, I was particularly uncomfortable: sleeping at night, guests next door, guests next door.The sound of bathing water is very loud, and the sound is like decoration next door; the service attitude of the hotel and restaurant is very poor. It may be that we took the breakfast coupon sent by the hotel.The intestines, after waiting for half an hour, have not been on, and finally do n’t eat away; the attitude of the front desk is not good. I do n’t have a smile from beginning to end. I ca n’t stop here next time."
1,外出时一般都会先看看当地的如家。这家店挺不错的。性价比高，服务也足够周到仔细，反应也很快。不过不怎么喜欢他们的制服啦，花花的，很难看。对了，只是离车站不是很近，边上那家超市，食品怀疑过期(面包)，离恐龙园也远，但是门口就有公交站台，还算交通方便。补充点评2008年1月28日：说错了，是虎丘，哈哈~~,"When you go out, you usually look at the local home.This shop is pretty good.The price is high, the service is thoughtful enough, and the response is fast.But don't like their uniforms very much, it's ugly.By the way, it is not very close to the station. The supermarket on the side, the food suspicion is expired (bread), and it is far from the dinosaur garden, but there is a bus platform at the door, which is convenient.Supplementary comment on January 28, 2008: Said wrong, it's a tiger hill, haha ~~"
1,"交通很方便,就是酒店地处居民区中,不是一眼就能找到.订的大床房,床超大,酒店服务也不错.出门周围有些商店及小吃街可以逛逛.","The transportation is very convenient, that is, the hotel is located in the residential area. It can not be found at a glance. The large bed is large, the bed is large, and the hotel service is good. Some shops and snack streets around you can go shopping."

When I arrived at the hotel at night, I said the room was said, and I did not find my order. Later, I called Ctrip and said that the hotel had already passed the order.It was only given the room in ten minutes. After arriving at the room, there were still the remaining garbage left by others. The environment was not good. The outside was the road, and it was noisy. Anyway, it was quite unpleasant."

1,2月11日在这里住了两天，优点：1位置很好，吃饭、玩都很方便2饭店包车服务比在街上找出租车便宜3酒店内部环境很美4我住的房间出门就可以看见雪山缺点：1房间门漏风，还会被风刮的很响，如不找东西顶上几乎睡不着2我住的那个楼离门口好远，几乎要迷路3早餐团队的人很多，但早餐尚可,"I lived here for two days on February 11. The advantages: 1 position is very good. It is convenient to eat and play. 2 Hotel charter services than finding a car rental on the street. The internal environment of the hotel is beautiful. 4 The room where I live in. I can go out when I go out.Seeing the disadvantages of Snow Mountain: 1 room door leaks, and it will still be scratched by the wind. If you do n’t find something, you ca n’t sleep on the building. The building I live is far away from the door.Still"
1,优点：房间条件简洁、气氛温馨，住宿环境比较安静，价格比较合理，服务态度好；不足：窗户几乎与后面的房顶等高，加上没有防盗窗（网），安全感不高。,"Advantages: The conditions of the room are simple, the atmosphere is warm, the accommodation environment is relatively quiet, the price is reasonable, and the service attitude is good; inadequate: the window is almost high as the roof behind, and there is no anti -theft window (net). The sense of security is not high."
1,定了两个标准房，总体还满意。早餐还不错。前台服务也不错。,"Two standard rooms were set, and they were all satisfied.Breakfast is not bad.The front desk service is also good."
1,五一住了这里，作为三星级硬件还可以。前台经理赞一个，我们一行在隔壁吃饭，发票中了奖，但饭馆就是不肯帮我们兑，态度也很无理。我们将此事说与宾馆，前台张颖经理说帮我们处理，并为我们邮回北京，虽然钱还没收到，但是我们心里很愉快，毕竟这种专业的责任意识与服务意识，在中华大地是值得提倡的。,"May Day lived here, and it can be used as a Samsung hardware.The front desk manager praised one. We ate next door and won the award in the invoice, but the restaurant was unwilling to help us, and the attitude was very unreasonable.We will say this matter with the hotel and the forefront of Zhang Ying said to help us handle it and post back to Beijing for us. Although the money has not been received, we are very happy. After all, this professional sense of responsibility and serviceIt is worth advocating."
1,酒店房间很好，浴室在房间中间，但要小心一定要把窗帘拉下，对面就是办公楼。酒店服务非常到位。绝对超值。,"The hotel room is very good. The bathroom is in the middle of the room, but be careful to pull the curtains down, opposite the office building.The hotel service is in place.Absolute value."

0,类似于80年代的招待所，要自己下到一楼打开水，开水瓶看的倒是挺结实的。没有电话，叫服务生只能靠人工。洗澡水据说要放20分钟凉水后才会热，我们确实很有耐心放了20分钟，还是冻人。实在心疼水就凑合冲了。空调只有冷风。两张超小的床。总而言之是我住过最为辛苦的房间。,"Similar to a guest house in the 1980s, you have to go down to the first floor to open the water, and the water bottle is quite solid.Without a phone, the waiter can only rely on manual.It is said that the bath water is said to be hot for 20 minutes before it will be hot. We really have patiently put it for 20 minutes, or froze.It's really distressed that the water is made up.The air conditioner is only cold wind.Two super small beds.All in all, I have lived the hardest room."
0,这家店比市里的莫泰态度上稍微好点，不过房间也很小，住在里面不是特别舒服。服务员多数是生手，明显就不是很熟练的员工。我想也许压缩成本吧，莫泰也只能这样了。一夜情专用的旅馆，为的就是图个方便，快，他们也不指望多少回头客的。,"This shop is slightly better than the Motai attitude in the city, but the room is also small, and it is not particularly comfortable living inside.Most of the waiters are raw, obviously not very skilled employees.I think maybe compressing costs, and Mo Tai can only do that.The one -night love hotel is convenient, fast, and they don't expect how many returning customers."
1,意外，入住时给了早餐券和一张50元餐券。用完自助早餐后，中午在旋转餐厅用了个行政套餐，还余3块钱，可惜不退给我。不错，酒店包两餐，社会主义啊。,"Accidentally, breakfast coupons and 50 yuan coupons were given during check -in.After using the buffet breakfast, I used an administrative package in the rotating restaurant at noon, and it was 3 yuan, but I would not refund it.Yes, there are two meals in the hotel, socialism."
1,"第一次去香港,住帝豪奥运.之前也看了大家的评论,还是没有实际感受来得真切呵.我和老婆的一致评论如下:优点:1.酒店","For the first time to Hong Kong, I lived in the Emperor Olympic Games. I also read everyone's comments before. I still did n’t have the actual feelings. The unanimous comments with my wife and I are as follows: advantages: 1. Hotel"
1,"性价比非常好的酒店，房间设施超好，前台服度超好,商房配,床稍硬...","The cost -effective hotel, the room facilities are super good, the front desk is super good, the house is good, the bed is slightly harder ... the bed is slightly harder ..."
1,"Chexkin倒是蛮快,Chexkout用了近半个小时,11:00-12:00的时候,工作台却只有一个小姐.","Chexkin is quite fast. Chexkout took nearly half an hour. When 11: 00-12: 00, there was only one lady in the workbench."
0,"很典型的型酒店就是房很小,生也不大。并且设施非常的简陋。空得了些",A typical hotel is that the room is small and the life is not large.And the facilities are very simple.Be empty
1,"这里的房间是比较舒适,只是地理位置不如解放杯和江北了,也就算了吧,这也不算hotel的错,只是服务上,大堂的人永远比较冷漠,服务生缺少微笑,连要一张停车拳他都会向警察一样用审问的态度问很多问题:比如房间号,车牌号,然后看到房间是我先生登记的,看我又是个女的,表示完全不相信,要我说我先生的生日....不就是个停车拳么?事实上这个hotel","The room here is relatively comfortable, but the geographical location is not as good as the liberation cup and Jiangbei, so it ’s okay. This is not the wrong mistake. It’ s just a service. The people in the lobby are always indifferent.He will ask a lot of questions to the police like the police like the police: such as the room number, the license plate number, and then see that the room is registered by my husband.Birthday ... isn't it a parking boxing? In fact"
0,好烂的酒店，到前台登记的时候只有一个服务员，服务员对我同事直呼其名，同事还臭美说感觉是他大学的美女同学在叫他，我们住的所谓的商务房在7楼，电梯只能到6楼，到了房间一看，这7楼应该是后续改建成客房的，甚至可能是违章建筑，洗手间很小，是买的飞机上用的那种一体化产品。房间上不了网，电话打了一下按键就跳不起来，到同事的房间打电话叫服务员，过了半天跑上来两个愣头愣脑的东北小妹，态度热心，但是完全可以看出来是菜鸟。,"There is only one waiter when you register at the front desk. The waiter calls his colleagues directly. The colleague also said that it was the beauty classmate of his university.You can only go to the 6th floor. When you look at the room, the 7th floor should be converted into a guest room in the future. It may even be illegal buildings. The toilet is very small. It is the integrated product used on the aircraft.The room couldn't be on the net. After calling the key, I couldn't jump. I called the waiter in the colleague's room. After a long time, I ran up two northeast girls with my head."
0,这应该是我在用携程订房以来所遇到的最烂的酒店了，居然还是4星的。理由如下：1，酒店所提供的房间是临窗的，下面就是一座立交桥，虽然是在10楼，但是还是非常吵，特别是上下班的时候，简直就像住在菜场里面。2，房间的淋浴室花洒没有办法调整，站在淋浴房里你就得准备先享受享受冷水浴3，门有时会发出神经质的报警声音，估计是报警器的接触不良，修了也修不好。4，电梯太慢5，整个酒店的小姐特别多，而且完全不分白天黑夜的到处乱窜，简直不得了6，停车就不用说了，还要拿个票到前台盖章。有时候忘记了，好不容易开车出来到门口，发现没盖章，保安说什么都要你交停车费。再有就是你办事回来的时候千万不要遇上上下班，要不然，你就得和轿车、卡车、公交车、摩托车、自行车、行人甚至是动物争抢每一寸马路（真不知道立交桥下怎么会有这样的交通状况，就像是10年以前的中国县城）6，而且，礼品有圈套的。携程写明有礼品赠送，其实就是一瓶水。我们刚刚入住酒店，酒店的前台经理（后来才知道）打电话告诉我们：酒店冰箱的可乐和鲜橙多是免费的。想着有携程的描述，还不错。哪知道一结帐，告知我们消费30元，因为我们消费了冰箱的饮料。后来前台经理才说，只赠送一瓶，可乐和鲜橙多任选。你想想，我两个人入住，只让喝一瓶，这是什么狗屁规定！一瓶10元，别说赠送1瓶，送3瓶都有赚的了。不知道携程有份参与没有，只是酒店坚持必须买单我们就非常不舒服，哪有星级酒店这么干的，客户与酒店产生异议的时候，从来都是酒店主动让步的，切！补充点评2007年10月19日：看到了下面的评价，我马上查了一下信用卡帐单，果然是预授权还没有取消，我的天哪，2400呀，就算冻结了，真是要命！,"This should be the worst hotel I have encountered after using Ctrip. It is actually 4 stars.The reason is as follows: 1. The room provided by the hotel is near the window, and the following is a overpass. Although it is on the 10th floor, it is still very noisy, especially when you get up to get off work, it is like living in the vegetable market.2. There is no way to adjust the shower shower in the room. Standing in the shower room, you have to enjoy the cold water bath first. Sometimes the door will make a neurotic alarm sound. It is estimated that the alarm is poor.Essence4, the elevator is too slow. 5. There are many ladies in the entire hotel, and they are completely scrambled around the day and night. It is almost incompetent 6. Needless to say, you need to take a ticket to the front desk to stamp.Sometimes I forgot that I finally drove out to the door and found that I did n’t stamp it. The security guard said that you need to pay the parking fee.Then there is, when you come back, do not encounter get off work. Otherwise, you have to compete with cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, bicycles, pedestrians, and even animals.How can there be such a traffic situation, like the county's county 10 years ago) 6, and gifts have a trap.Ctrip states that there are gift gifts, but it is actually a bottle of water.We just stayed at the hotel. The front desk manager of the hotel (later known) called us: The cola and fresh orange of the hotel's refrigerator are free.Thinking of Ctrip's description, it's not bad.Do you know that we will consume 30 yuan because we spend a refrigerator drink.Later, the front desk manager said that only one bottle, cola and fresh orange options.If you think about it, the two of me stay in and only let a bottle of drinking. What kind of shit regulations are!One bottle is 10 yuan, let alone give 1 bottle, and 3 bottles are made.I do n’t know if Ctrip has any participation, but the hotel insists that we must pay for it. We are very uncomfortable. When there are star hotels, when customers and hotels have objections, they have always given the initiative to concessions, cut!Supplementary comment on October 19, 2007: After seeing the following evaluation, I immediately checked the credit card bill. It really was pre -authorized that has not been canceled. My God, 2400, even if it was frozen, it was terrible!"
1,说实话初次到绍兴，住这个酒店比较好，为什么呢，因为离景点都比较近，条件还不错，房子比较有特色，只是楼道慢陡的，接送的师傅人比较好，服务员也还不错。,"To be honest, I arrived in Shaoxing for the first time. It is better to stay in this hotel. Why? Because the attractions are relatively close, the conditions are good, the house is more distinctive, but the corridor is slow, the master who picks up and drops off, and the waiter is good."
0,房间设施很一般、也很陈旧了。宣传册上说是“三星待评”，估计凭这种硬件设施想评三星基本上是不可能的。度假村内没有餐厅，用早餐需步行10多分钟到贵宾楼，还要另外付费，成人20元每人，儿童10元每人。,"The room facilities are very ordinary and old.The brochure is said to be ""Samsung to be reviewed"". It is estimated that it is basically impossible to evaluate Samsung with this hardware facilities.There are no restaurants in the resort. You need to walk to VIP building for breakfast for more than 10 minutes, and pay separately. Adults are 20 yuan per person, and children are 10 yuan per person."
0,酒店设施老化严重。作为一家五星级酒店，居然没有无烟楼层（这是前台登记的时候酒店服务员说的）,"The hotel facilities are serious.As a five -star hotel, there is no smoke -free floor (this was said when the hotel waiter said when the front desk was registered)"
1,比想象的要好。看来金钥匙联盟还是有一定的质量控制的。房间设施还可以，就是烟味太重。回来睡衣上全是烟味。早餐很一般，可选择的东西少。不过那个巴基斯坦服务生态度倒是很好。就在鸭绿江边上，周边环境到还可以,"It's better than imagined.It seems that the Golden Key Alliance still has certain quality control.The room facilities are okay, but the smell of smoke is too heavy.The smell of smoke on the pajamas.Breakfast is very average, there are few choices.However, the Pakistani service ethics is very good.Just on the side of the Yalu River, the surrounding environment is okay"
1,酒店位置非常好，周围购物很方便。房间还算干净，就是毛巾被单稍旧。晚上房间没暖风，这季节，冷！,"The hotel location is very good, and it is convenient to shop around.The room is quite clean, that is, the towels are slightly old.There is no warm wind in the room at night, this season, cold!"
1,近火站，位置方便中。以三星之酒店尺度及格置，平心而，委不，中中距之，直超值，是程的好推介，。大堂不豪，但敞舒，坐得久了，服奉茶。花停，客房外望，野空，不促，而且恰化。提供免上，偶有故障，服都迅速有地助，度友善文，殊堪嘉。客房足，生，是踏的良好服。大理而又不持住入古城者，考。补充点评2007年10月22日：同意先前有友推介餐服亦算不，但菜色欠吸引。,"Near the fire station, convenient location.With Samsung's hotel scale and compatibility, fairness, no, mid -range, direct value, is a good promotion of Cheng.The lobby is not proud, but it is open, sitting for a long time, serving tea.Passing, looking out of the guest room, wild air, not promoting, and just right.For exemption, there are occasional faults, the service is quickly helped, and the friendly text is good.The guest room is full, and it is a good service for stepping.Dali and not staying in the ancient city, test.Supplementary comment on October 22, 2007: Agree with an previous friend to promote meals, but the dishes are not attracted."
1,感觉比较温馨，价格也比较适合于一般商务。,"It feels more warm, and the price is more suitable for general business."
1,酒店位置离虹桥机场很近.硬件也好.自租餐服务尚待提高.,The hotel location is very close to Hongqiao Airport. The hardware is good. The self -rented meal service is to be improved.
1,周末和朋友骑单车到佘山一游，入住该酒店。个人感觉该酒店从设施到服务均有4星水准（可能某些硬件设备还达不到4星要求）。全部房间均在大幢的别墅内，每幢别墅共3层，每层房间均可！服务员及保安态度都很好（我们入住的为该酒店最便宜的房间290/天）！佘山附近的环山路骑单车游完很舒服（每天16：30以后可骑车上山不收门票），附近的佘山小镇吃东西很便宜，还有一家很不错的羊肉面馆（只做白切羊肉面/红烧羊肉面两种面食，专业！）。就是旅游区的商业气氛过于浓烈，还好我们单车游，可以不理会这些！,"On the weekend, I rode a bicycle to Laoshan and stayed in the hotel.I personally feel that the hotel has 4 stars from facilities to services (maybe certain hardware equipment does not meet the requirements of 4 stars).All rooms are in large buildings, with 3 floors in each villa, and each floor is available!The waiter and security attitude are very good (we stay in the hotel's cheapest room 290/day)!The cycling of Huanshan Road near Laoshan is very comfortable (after 16:30 every day, you can ride up the mountain and do not collect tickets). The nearby Town of Laoshan is very cheap, and there is a very good mutton noodle restaurant (only white -cut muttonNoodles/braised lamb noodle noodles, professional!).That is, the business atmosphere of the tourist area is too strong. Fortunately, our cycling tour, you can ignore these!"
1,"总的来说,这家店不错,就是环境有点吵闹,设备坏了也不维护,我洗澡的时候,差点被懂感冒,洗浴室的窗户把手坏了,冷风直灌,哎,不过早餐还行.","In general, this shop is good, that is, the environment is a bit noisy, and the equipment is not maintained. When I take a bath, I almost understand a cold.Then, then"
1,进房的第一感觉就是窗户很大，视野非常宽阔，仿佛就是挂了幅画在墙上似的。各种设施比较齐全，有点遗憾的就是房里没有大灯，可能另有考虑吧。,"The first feeling of entering the house is that the window is large and the field of vision is very wide, as if it is hanging on the wall.Various facilities are relatively complete. It is a bit regrettable that there are no headlights in the room, and you may consider it."
1,一个不错的酒店，如果不抽烟的话就住4层的无烟客房，适合一家人度假住，我在那里住了4个晚上，当然海滩和酒店园林就不如亚龙湾的天域度假酒店的漂亮，三亚湾吊床都没有的，天域就有，三亚湾假日好像俄国人比较多，,"A good hotel, if you do n’t smoke, live in 4 floors of smoke -free rooms, suitable for a family vacation. I live there for 4 nights. Of course, the beach and hotel garden are not as beautiful as the Tianyu resort hotel in Yalong Bay.There are no bay hacks, there are Tianyu, and there seems to be more Russians on Sanya Bay holiday."
1,前台服务较差，不为客户着想。房间有朋友来需要打扫，呼叫了两个小时也未打扫。房间下水道臭气熏天，卫生间漏水堵水。,"The front desk service is poor, not for customers.There are friends in the room who need to clean up, and after two hours of calling, it has not been cleaned.The waterway in the room was smelly, and the bathroom leaked water."
1,"印象最深的是,拉开窗帘时的感觉--外面是一高尔夫球场--很惬意!房间也不错,就是停车不太方便--太远了,刚好又碰到下雨.","What impressed me most was the feeling of opening the curtains-a golf course outside-very comfortable! The room is also good, but it is not convenient to park-too far, just happen to hit the rain again."
1,第一次去郑州出差就住的这家，总体感觉还是不错的。房间的一次性用品相对给的是这些酒店中质量最好的。卫生意设计的很有意思，空间利用非常合理。坐便的私密性处理的很好。,"The first time I went to Zhengzhou to live on a business trip, I felt good.The disposable supplies of the room are relative to the best quality in these hotels.The design of health is very interesting, and the use of space is very reasonable.The privacy of sitting is very good."
0,"我可以负责任的说,这是我住过最差的号称""三星""级的宾馆.与其说是家宾馆不如说是个农家乐之类的比较贴切.所有服务人员基本是一些农村家庭妇女.二楼房间的地板不知道是用什么东西拼凑成的,小孩一跳几乎地动山摇,房间的墙壁最多也就是层三合板,我毫不夸张的说,隔壁有人放个屁都会听的一清二楚.为了推销他们那又贵又难吃的饭菜,居然骗我们说,枯岭街没有饭店,只是几家卖衣服的......靠!啥也不说了,天亮赶紧走人!","I can say responsiblely that this is the worst hotel I have lived in the ""Samsung"" -class hotel. It is better to say that the hotel is a more appropriate. All service personnel are basically some rural housewives.The floor of the room does not know what is made up. The child jumps almost in the mountains. The wall of the room is at most the layer three -in -board board. I do n’t exaggerate. Some people next door will be listened to it.In order to promote their expensive and unpalatable meals, we lied to us that there were no restaurants in Duckling Street, just a few of them selling clothes ... Damn! Say nothing, dawn, hurry up!"
1,"总体还不错的.房间很大,很干净.价格能再优惠点就好了.",The overall is not bad. The room is very large and very clean. The price can be preferentially preferential.
0,这个酒店啊，不务正业!奉劝该管理层，心思用到正地方。,"This hotel, do not do business! I advise the management, and use the place to use the place."
1,国庆期间携程特价入住该酒店豪华房，这是第一次入住沈阳的该酒店，以前一直入住青年公园附近的凯宾斯基，有以下几点印象――1、从硬件设施来讲，黎明酒店非常不错，和凯宾斯基有一比，比我们上海的五星酒店的硬件都要好，特别是卫生间，明亮、宽敞、干净；2、虽然环境略显荒凉，但距离沈阳的中街商业区步行也只需25分钟，交通很方便；3、从软件来讲，携程预定时标明房间的宽带是免费的，可是入住后发现要收费，随即与携程取得联络，告知免费（这里表扬一下携程，有职业操守！很好！）；4、不过入住酒店后发生了一件本来很不愉快地经历，让我差一点从此放弃日后入住该酒店；由于我的老父亲头发乌过了，因此，弄脏了酒店的枕套，客房清理人员随即让我赔偿50元，这是我第一次入住五星级酒店让我赔偿，在结账时告知了前台，并打算把那个天价枕套拿走留个纪念，也许前台的小姐也觉得实在不好意思，随即不知道和谁打了电话，告知不用赔偿了，并诚恳地向我表示希望下次继续入住黎明酒店。我这里并不是说这区区50元，只是这50元背后显示了酒店的服务意识和服务理念。沈阳的经济虽然落后，但服务行业的服务态度普遍不好，但这次入住黎明酒店使我明显感觉到了沈阳这个最大的东北城市的服务意识与服务态度的提高。相比较而言，服务行业服务最好的城市当首数深圳市，就连上海都没法和深圳比，但尽管如此，上海仍然可以排在第二位，但与深圳的服务质量的差距很大；沈阳和北京的服务态度其实差不多，但这次入住黎明，使我感受到了一点不一样，也许我们的老工业基地真的在发生巨变。希望如此！再多说一句，服务行业，服务的态度和质量是服务行业的生命！通过这次入住，赞扬携程、赞扬黎明酒店。,"During the National Day, Ctrip specially stayed in the hotel's luxury room. This is the first time in the hotel in Shenyang. He had been staying in Kaboski near the Youth Park before.Very good, compared with Kobezki, better than our hardware in Shanghai's five -star hotel, especially the bathroom, bright, spacious and clean; 2. Although the environment is slightly desolate, it is also walking from the Zhongjie commercial district in Shenyang.It only takes 25 minutes, and the transportation is very convenient. 3. From the perspective of software, the broadband of the room is marked by Ctrip in terms of scheduled. However, after check -in, I found that we need to charge.Conflict! Very good!); 4. But after staying at the hotel, a very unpleasant experience happened, which made me almost abandon the hotel in the future; because my old father's hair was black, so I dirty the hotelIn the pillow, the guest room cleansing staff immediately asked me to compensate 50 yuan. This is the first time I stayed in a five -star hotel for me to compensate me. I informed the front desk at the checkout and planned to leave the sky -high pillow.The lady also felt embarrassed, and then didn't know who called with, informing me that she would not need to compensate, and sincerely expressed her hope to continue to stay at the Liming Hotel next time.I do n’t say that this area is 50 yuan, but the hotel ’s service awareness and service concept are displayed behind the 50 yuan.Although Shenyang's economy is backward, the service attitude of the service industry is generally not good, but this time staying at the Liming Hotel, I obviously feel the improvement of the service consciousness and service attitude of this largest Northeast city in Shenyang.In comparison, the city with the best service in the industry is Shenzhen, and even Shanghai cannot compare with Shenzhen, but despite this, Shanghai can still rank second, but the gap with Shenzhen's service quality is veryBig; Shenyang and Beijing's service attitude is actually similar, but this time I stayed in dawn, which made me feel a little different. Maybe our old industrial bases have really changed.hope so!One more thing, the attitude and quality of the service industry, the service attitude and quality are the life of the service industry!Through this check -in, praise Ctrip and praise the Liming Hotel."
1,每次住这个酒店的时候，总是给我免费升级，很有意思。房间很好，服务也不错。下次来还会住在这里。,"Every time I live in this hotel, I always upgrade me for free, which is very interesting.The room is very good and the service is good.I will live here next time."
0,这应该是我见过能称为五星最恶心的酒店了，服务不好，房间不好，早点不好，听说是个没老板开的，太不讲究了，好好改改吧！麻烦携程推荐好的酒店！,"This should be that I have seen the most disgusting hotel that can be called five -star. The service is not good, the room is not good, and the room is not good. I heard that it was a boss who opened it.Trouble Ctrip recommended a good hotel!"
0,"房间还算干净,卫生间很大,但没有设施。提供的毛巾每人只有一条，还是破的。总体来说不太令人满意。","The room is quite clean, the bathroom is very large, but there is no facility.There is only one towel provided by the provided, but it is broken.Overall is not very satisfactory."
0,"这个宾馆真是神奇:1,从早上7点多开始放大声的背景音乐一直到晚上11点多,而且一直是同一张CD,简直会让人发疯.我和朋友开玩笑说,宾馆应该给每个入住的客人都发一个耳塞,这样客人不会发疯.我们第二天就搬家了.天哪!2,宾馆宣传的照片跟实际完全不符.照片上看房间超豪华,五星水准.实际是3星水准.空调除了发出噪音外,根本不制热.房间的门是关不上的,宾馆解释说只有在冬天的时候,门缩水了才能关上.电视机是不能看的.所以说平遥的星级是不能相信的.但是如果不是自己亲自来,真的想象不出差距会这么大.3,早餐上的咖啡比速溶咖啡都差,牛奶是掺水的.4,房价是780元.大家自己决定去不去住吧.后来我们搬到天元奎去了.好了很多,价格也便宜.里面的服务生也特别好.云锦诚在当地排场挺大,但是口碑不怎么样.我们这种不是政府官员的人不太适合这种地方.我从来没住过这么差的宾馆.","This hotel is really amazing: 1. From 7 am, the background music of loudly until 11 o'clock in the evening, and it has always been the same CD, which will make people crazy.The guests all send a earplug, so that the guests will not go crazy. We moved the next day. God! 2, the photos promoted by the hotel are completely inconsistent with the actual. The room is super luxurious in the photo.In addition to the noise of the air conditioner, no heating at all. The door of the room cannot be closed. The hotel's explanation said that only in winter, the door can be closed.Can't believe it. But if you don't come by yourself, you really imagine that the gap will be so big .3, coffee on breakfast is worse than steaming coffee, milk is mixed with water. 4, house price is 780 yuan.Don't live. Later, we moved to Tian Yuankui. Okay, the price is also cheap. The waiters in it are also very good. Yun Jincheng is quite large in the local punch, but the reputation is not good. We are not government officials.People are not suitable for this kind of place. I have never lived in such a bad hotel."
0,"准备带一家人来过年的,订了两天两个套间,就为了图个清净.可是除夕下午患了感冒,晚上房间里的空调根本不热,而且声音奇响.结果第二天只能匆匆提前离开.酒店位置很偏僻,自己没车进去了就出不来,周围好象有些象游乐场的设施,但冬天好象不开放,不知夏天怎么样.","Those who are going to bring the family for the New Year, booked two sets for two days, just to make a pure New Year's Eve. But there was a cold on New Year's Eve.Leaving in advance. The hotel location is very remote. If you do n’t go in, you ca n’t get out. It seems that there are some facilities in the playground, but it does n’t seem to be open in winter. I do n’t know how it is in summer."
1,我从06年开始几乎每月都有一次出差，山西很多酒店都住过了，印象最深的就是三晋国际，其他还有龙城国际，华苑宾馆，黄河京都，还有一个叫什么交通大厦的，下面我对这些酒店做个最真实、准确地点评：三晋国际――这是我认为最让太原市骄傲的酒店，我们衡量一个酒店的最直接的就是你能够得到什么服务，在这家酒店里，我感觉到了家一般的照顾，第一次来这里，感冒了，嘴里冷不丁说了一句，服务生就听到了，然后熬了一碗姜汤到我房间，当然也是免费的，很感动；洗澡时，一不小心摔倒了，副总经理、总监等等都慰问了我，其实这也不完全是酒店的错，但是从那以后，我发现每个房间浴室都放置了防滑垫和塑料拖鞋；有一次我把袜子之类的放在洗手间了，谁知道我回来后竟然发现服务员帮我免费清洗了，还把我不小心掰断的心爱的梳子还用胶给我粘好了，还留了言给我，真的很让我意外也有点不敢相信！对一个出差特别频繁，时间特别紧张的人来说，办理入住和退房就是一个最让人烦躁的时间，但是我算过了，三晋国际前台办理退房、入住的时间没有超过一分钟！！！在北京都很难有这样的待遇！其他的，比如前台接待、门厅服务之类的就不用说了，真的很好；当然我也有建议：1、酒店的被子能否换厚一点的，冬天冷啊；2、一些房间的电话没有免提，不是很方便；3、外面的电话打不进来，可能是酒店为了安全考虑吧，但还是希望能够有外线拨入的功能。龙城国际――不知道五星级是谁给的评价？！酒店一般，还不如华苑宾馆，无法容忍的是，前台接待服务态度太差了！唯一的优点是，早餐挺好吃。华苑宾馆――06、07年都挺好的，今天偶尔又住了一下，发现时间长了，枕头、被子不是很干净，其他倒是挺好的，服务态度、环境都还不错，早餐有点单一。黄河京都――地方太偏了！看起来挺好，住进去不咋地，无法容忍的是，也给大家提个醒，我退房的时间整整用了29分钟，快半个钟头了，我差点晕倒！结帐的服务员只顾打电话，不理我。交通大厦――噩梦般的酒店，我再也不会住了！！隔音效果太差，还不幸地让我听到了隔壁小两口的闺房密语，哈哈，让我坐噩梦的是，半夜不知道什么单位来查房，从好多房间带走了好多女孩子，好怕怕地说……还有就是前台一个戴眼镜的，白白的女孩子，态度可真差啊，郁闷！太原还有好多酒店，可能我不会一一住到，但还是希望所有的酒店都能够像三晋国际一样，给山西人长脸！,"I have been on a business trip almost every month since 2006. Many hotels in Shanxi have lived. The deepest impression is Sanjin International. Others are Longcheng International, Huayuan Hotel, Yellow River Kyoto.Well, I made the most authentic and accurate comments on these hotels: Sanjin International -This is the hotel I think is the most proud of Taiyuan City. The most direct thing we measure is what you can get.In the hotel, I felt the home -like care. For the first time, I came here. I caught a cold. When I said coldly, the waiter heard it, and then boiled a bowl of ginger soup to my room. Of course, it was also free.I was very moved; when I took a bath, I accidentally fell. The deputy general manager, director, etc. all condolences to me. In fact, this is not entirely the hotel's fault, but since then, I found that the bathroom in each room was placed without slippery slip rooms.Cushion and plastic slippers; once I put the socks and the like in the bathroom. Who knew that when I came back, I found that the waiter helped me clean it for free.It was left to me, so it really made me surprised and couldn't believe it!For a person who is particularly frequent and time is particularly nervous, handling and checking out is the most irritable time, but I have calculated that the time of checking out and staying at Sanjin International's front desk is not more than one minute!IntersectionIntersectionIt is difficult to have such treatment in Beijing!Others, such as the front desk reception, the entrance room service and the like, it is really good; of course, I also have suggestions: 1. Whether the quilt of the hotel can be thicker, cold in winter; 2. The phone number in some rooms has no phone callsIt is not very convenient for removal; 3. The outside phone cannot be made. It may be that the hotel can consider it for security, but I still hope that it can have the function of dialing the outside.Longcheng International -I don't know who given the evaluation of the five -star?IntersectionThe hotel is generally not as good as Huayuan Hotel. It is unbearable that the attitude of reception services at the front desk is too bad!The only advantage is that breakfast is delicious.Huayuan Hotels -06 and 07 years are very good. Today I lived occasionally. It was found that the pillows and quilts were not very clean. The others were good.EssenceYellow River Kyoto -The place is too biased!It looks pretty good.

0,酒店实在很糟糕，墙上贴着不能把四巾带走，说实话白给都不要，旧的只能擦地板。不是一次性拖鞋，淋浴喷头水很稀。床单和被子也不十分干净。房间不隔音，半夜被隔壁奇怪的咳嗽声惊醒，再也无法入睡。订了两个房间同时接到骚扰电话，可能是我们都是女士接听的，对方没有出声就挂断了。最糟糕的就是地下车库了，阴暗潮湿，蚊子巨多，汽车自行车混在一起没有分区，入库也没人看着，出库时现找人开门。其实车库并不大，而且只有一层，只要稍加装修就能改变现在的状况，只可惜没人重视这些细节。中午和前台打招呼要退房，上去取行李之后又被打电话说我们超时，服务简直太差了。蓬莱没有什么满意的住处，建议先到蓬莱游览完之后去烟台或威海住比较好。补充点评2007年8月1日：离海还隔着几条街呢怎么还说有海景房？真不知他们怎么想的！,"The hotel is really bad. The four towels can not be taken away on the wall. To be honest, the old one can only rub the floor.It is not a one -time slippers, and the shower head is very sparse.The sheets and quilts are not very clean.The room was not soundproof, and was awakened by the strange cough of the next door in the middle of the night, and could no longer fall asleep.I ordered two rooms to receive harassment calls at the same time. Maybe we all answered by women, and the other party hung up without a voice.The worst is the underground garage, dark and humid, there are many mosquitoes, and the car bicycles are mixed with no partitions. No one watched when entering the warehouse.In fact, the garage is not large, and there is only one layer. As long as it is slightly decorated, the current situation can be changed, but unfortunately no one values these details.Gels at the front desk to check out at the front desk. After getting up his luggage, he was called to say that we timeout, and the service was too bad.Penglai has no satisfactory residence. It is recommended to go to Yantai or Weihai after going to Penglai first after visiting Penglai.Supplementary comment on August 1, 2007: How many streets are there in separation of the sea? Why is there a sea view room?I really don't know what they think!"
0,酒店的装修比较陈旧，房间的隔音，主要是卫生间的隔音非常差，只能算是一般的,The decoration of the hotel is relatively old. The sound insulation in the room is mainly the sound insulation in the bathroom is very poor. It can only be regarded as average.

1,"携程这次不错，订的行政房给我免费升级到了8号楼的山景房。对于酒店，总结一下：超5星的环境4星的房间3星的设施和服务酒店分栋依山而建，酒店里有专门的散步路线图，要把整个酒店的山景从容走完至少1小时，期间山水桥路，鸟叫虫鸣，空气清新，心旷神怡！8号楼是酒店最好的一栋楼了（价格最贵），进入房间，房间宽大，落地窗外就是山景翠色。但其大床一看就知不会很舒服，床很低，床垫质量不好，床上用品虽然干净但明显成色已经旧了灰扑扑的颜色，摸上去硬邦邦的，家具电器以及卫生间用品都很一般。68一位早餐品种还是比较丰富，吃饱没问题，精致美味就谈不上了。各处的服务员态度还是很好但服务意识和服务质量应提高，酒店有宽阔的停车场，不过无论住店客人均收费。宾馆反馈2008年7月10日：您好!感谢您对红珠山宾馆提出的宝贵意见,我宾馆现已经将布草全部更换,您的意见我们已经交给相关部门进行处理,我们诚恳地期待您的下次光临!","Ctrip is good this time.

0,入住经历：由于临时到邯郸，时间较晚，酒店都订满了，只好住这，以前通过携程订住过邯郸宾馆，设施非常齐备，就觉得邯郸大酒店应该也不会差到哪去，一进大厅就感觉有种陈旧的感觉，一个服务生马上迎来要帮我拎包，被我婉拒，但仍跟在我身边，到前台办理入住手续，给我4、5个本子让我在上面签字，给我一张房卡和押金单，上楼，服务生仍未离开我身边要帮我拿包，再次婉拒，一路上服务生不停的给我介绍他们酒店是国营的云云。我住在4楼，刚一进走廊，就有特别浓的炒菜油烟味，进房间后第一感觉就是上当了，房间潮湿、有股霉味，狭小，破旧，电视也就14、15寸吧，黑白、外加雪花，一想办完事就走顶多1、2天，忍了。因为晚上要出去见个朋友，习惯性的检查一下门窗，发现窗户竟然都没有锁，而且从卫生间浴缸迈过窗台外面就是一个连通的缓台，找服务员询问万一离开房间电脑和贵重物品得不到安全保证，得到蛮横答复：我们这就这样。从入住算起，前后不到10分钟时间，态度截然相反。心情不爽，但忍了......第二天早上想吃点早餐然后出去办事，因为没有送来早餐券，打电话咨询是否用房卡就可就餐，得到答复是昨晚登记时我已经在本上签字，一口咬定给过我早餐券了，经过反复强调、解释，最终勉强让我去吃早餐，但极其不情愿就像我骗他一顿早餐，欠他个人情似的，心情相当不爽，决定不去吃了，退房。到前台服务生爱理不理，退房找钱，押金600，一天房费234，找给我66元，虽然生气，钱还是要单面点清楚地，发现差的也太离谱了，询问后又退给我300元，怒火快要爆发了。退给我的三张百元钞票中有一张残缺了三分之一的面积，当即让她换，服务生上下左右看看确认是少了三分之一的面积才换。气晕。拎包头也不回地大步迈出大门，认可露宿街头（当然也不至于这么惨）也不在这受气，最后在携程的帮助下定了燕赵之星酒店，非常满意，携程的态度我认为是非常好的，服务也非常周到，我也是一直支持携程，是忠诚用户，给携程提一点建议，希望携程在选择合作酒店时能认真筛选，像这种收费与服务极不相符的酒店，坚决拒绝门外，宁少勿滥。,"Checking experience: Due to the temporary arrival in Handan, the hotel is full, so I have to live in this. I used to book Handan Hotel through Ctrip. The facilities were very complete.I feel old when entering the hall. A waiter immediately ushered in helping me with a bag. I was declined by me, but I still followed me and went to the front desk to check in. I gave me 4 or 5 books to let me sign it on it.Give me a room card and deposit list. When you go upstairs, the waiter has not left me to help me get a bag. I rejected it again. The waiters kept introducing me to the hotel.I live on the 4th floor. As soon as I entered the corridor, I had a particularly strong oil fume smell. After entering the room, the first feeling was to be fooled., Black and white, plus snowflakes, take the top 1 or 2 days as soon as you want to do it, and endure it.Because you have to go out to see a friend at night, check the doors and windows habitually, and find that the windows are not locked, and it is a connected platform from the window sill from the bathroom of the bathroom.To security guarantee, get a brutal reply: we are that.Starting from check -in, less than 10 minutes before and after, the attitude is completely opposite.I feel uncomfortable, but I endure it ... I want to have some breakfast the next morning and go out to do business, because I did not send breakfast coupons, I can call whether to use a house card to eat. I received a reply. I registered last night. I registered last night. I registered last night. I registered last night.I have already signed it on my book, and I have given me a breakfast coupon. After repeated emphasis and explanation, I finally barely asked me to have breakfast, but I was very reluctant to lie like I cheated him for breakfast, owed him personal feelings, mood in mood, and mood.It's quite unhappy, I decided not to eat it, and check out.At the front desk, the waiter cares about it, check out the money, the deposit is 600, and the house fee is 234 a day. Find me 66 yuan. Although I am angry, the money still has a clear one -sided one -sided.Retreating to me 300 yuan, the anger is about to outbreak.One of the three hundred yuan banknotes returned to me was one -third of the area of one -third. Immediately let her change it. The waiter looked up and down to confirm that it was one -third of the area before changing.Qi dizziness.Bao Toutou stepped out of the door without looking back, and recognized that the streets (of course are not so miserable) are not so angry. Finally, the help of Yan Zhaoxing Hotel was set up with the help of Ctrip.The service is also very thoughtful. I have always supported Ctrip. It is a loyal user. I give Ctrip some suggestions. I hope that Ctrip can carefully screen when choosing a cooperative hotel.Ning Shao should not be abused."
1,确实是有不断的进步，前台＼礼宾的服务有了明显提高，以后还会继续住在这里！特别感谢的是这次入住商务间收到了一小盒６瓶装食醋口服液，当天晚上喝掉一瓶，余下的原想带走的，由于特殊时期火车上不许带液体，就赠送给了服务员。但还是要谢谢酒店！,"Indeed, there are continuous progress. The service of the front desk has improved significantly, and it will continue to live here in the future!I am particularly grateful to receive a small box of 6 bottles of vinegar oral liquid this time in the business room. I drank a bottle that night.EssenceBut do you want to thank the hotel!"

1,非常好的酒店，服务没的说。到店后知道我们是第一次入住，给免费升级成公寓房，房内设施很好，装修格调我很喜欢。前台给送进房间，服务员帮我们换好拖鞋，泡好咖啡。唯一遗憾的是停车场比较小，大堂里面沙发很少，显得很空旷。下次有机会一定还来这里。,"Very good hotel, if you don't have the service.After arriving at the store, we know that we are staying in for the first time. I have upgraded to an apartment room for free. The facilities in the room are very good. I like the decoration style.The front desk was sent to the room, and the waiter helped us change his slippers and soaked coffee.The only regret is that the parking lot is relatively small, and there are few sofas in the lobby, which looks very empty.I will come here next time."
1,德宝饭店装修很过时，估计是上世纪90年代装修过的，配套实施更老。尤其是卫生间的淋浴居然放的很低，让我不能站着洗澡，喷头居然在腰的位置。门口打车很不方便，在早晨9点左右要等10分钟左右。除了地理位置比较好以外，没有什么优势。补充点评2008年3月5日：而且在二会期间，房价在飞涨,"Debao Hotel's decoration is very outdated. It is estimated that it was decorated in the 1990s, and the supporting facilities were older.Especially the bathroom shower was very low, so that I couldn't take a bath, and the spray head was in the waist.It is inconvenient to take a taxi at the door. It takes about 10 minutes at about 9 am.There is no advantage except for the better geographical location.Supplementary comment on March 5, 2008: During the second meeting, house prices are soaring"
1,在宽带和早餐服务方面略有不快，好在大堂经理和餐厅领班及时出面解决了问题。我住的是豪华大床房，房间宽敞、布局合理，很不错。总的来说很满意。,"It is slightly unhappy in broadband and breakfast services.

There are domestic sheep miscellaneous shops for the door, which is absolutely authentic.In addition to the price is slightly more expensive, it is still very satisfied"
0,绝对能评上最差如家了！！1，第一间房：入住后发现网络不能用，找人维修后被告知线路坏了，让我自己重新整理行李下楼换房。2，第二间房：一开门就是一股异味，明显很久每人注了一股强烈的霉味！！我在走廊上找服务员根本没人理我，只能再次换房！我在前台提出意见根本就不理我！3，第三间房：发现“不间断电源”是没电的，但我实在不想再换房了。谁知道等我放好行李准备出门办事时发现房门居然是锁不上的，关门后只要稍微用力一推门就开了！天哪！这是什么酒店啊！！再次找人维修。我问维修的师傅这里哪间房是好的，我就换那间，但师傅给我的回答就是这个破酒店只是在原来的基础上稍微改了一下，他都不知道还有哪间房是好的。4，我入住的那天有下雨，走廊的地毯、卫生间什么的全都有渗水的现象，楼层通风不好导致一股霉味。5，我点了两菜一汤，一共花了一小时才上齐！,"It can definitely be the worst home!Intersection1. The first room: After check -in, I found that the network could not be used.

0,这是一家住宿房间设施极差的度假村，我提前在携程网订了一间5号楼的房间，但是，当我入住时前台因为没有房间，竟然说没有接到订单，然后给了6号楼，空调很响，隔音又差，隔壁房间的一举一动都听见，原计划住两天，吓得第二天赶快逃。离开后发现，其实附近的好的宾馆还是不少的。不过度假村的环境在当地还是可以。,"This is a resort with poor accommodation room facilities. I book a room 5 in Ctrip.com in advance. However, when I stayed in the front desk because I had no room, I said that I did not receive an order. Then I gave it to Building 6.The air conditioner was very loud and the sound insulation was poor. Every move in the room next door was heard. It was originally planned for two days, scaring the next day to escape.After leaving, I found that there are still many good hotels nearby.However, the environment of the resort is still available in the local area."
0,上海Motel268酒店的失望之旅2008年4月7日-12日参加上海新国际博览中心的一个展览会，通过携程定了酒店，一共17间房间，定在位于上海市羽山路166号（桃林路口）的Motel268。但在此酒店住的6天非常不愉快，发生了纠纷，虽然经过一段时间的交涉，至今未解决。这家酒店的服务实在是不敢恭维，情况如下：1、刷银行卡不给凭条，导致退房时发生纠纷。我在4月7日、8日、9日分别有定房，7、8日我刷的是信用卡，因为定的房间比较多，9日又新开的房间因为信用卡额度不够，我刷的是借记卡，二次刷卡都不给刷卡凭条，并说这是酒店的规定（前台当时是把条放在了我订房的文件袋里）。11日中午，我退16个房间，前台只承认我7/8日有刷卡，居然不承认我9日银行卡刷过押金，并且一口拒绝我没有付过，（前台小姐匆忙找了一段时间后，估计是刷卡底单遗失）。从另一个角度来讲，如果一个房客订房不付押金，能平白给房客入住吗？？？可能吗？？！2、服务态度太差，没有一个以客户为中心的意识。出现纠纷之后，没有及时做出相应的解决办法，酒店财务拒绝当面交涉，只能电话沟通，效果非常不理想，并且拒绝与银行核查纠纷款项是否有划入酒店帐户，理由是：今日出纳不在。3、后续跟进服务速度太慢，并根本没给解决解决问题。4月11日我返回宁波，即在当地银行查询帐户交易清单，才发现800元被冻结在帐户里，于是又与上海Motel酒店沟通相关事宜，经过携程的沟通和协调，此酒店最终与4月15日才与我核对开户行及帐号，并在4月18日给我电话说已和银行取消了冻结。但我前5月初电话至银行，银行小姐说根本没有收到他的取消函，否则如果收到，银行马上会解除。直至今日问题仍未解决，只好等待一个月后银行的自动解除此笔款的冻结。4、酒店性价比太低。前台人员太少（退房排队+退房+查房=1小时）。标准间288元/天，不含早。自助早餐28元/位（早点品种少的可以）。周围也找不到吃早餐的地方。配套设施非常不齐备。引起我们的深思：对于我们一个出差在外的商务旅行者来说，所需求的就是酒店的服务。如果一个酒店的服务有问题，并发生了问题并不给予解决，那我们还如何去享受此酒店的服务呢？其实做为身在异地的游客，需要的仅仅是在解决问题的态度，加上一些诚意，毕竟我们不会吹毛求疵地要求酒店做出多大的赔偿之类要求，更可能花费太多时间处理这些纠纷，而酒店应当主动的主导事件的解决。反观Motel268酒店，非但没有主动、积极的处理事件的解决，甚至一直推卸酒店的责任。直到今日，我仍然未收到任何关于Motel268酒店相关部门、人员的解决电话或者邮件，我的帐户依然被冻结着，我的电话始终未曾响起，而我失望的心，早已随着黄浦江的水，缓慢的淌着…………。,"The disappointment journey of Shanghai MOTEL268 Hotel participated in a exhibition at the Shanghai New International Expo Center from April 7th to 12th, 2008. The hotel was determined through Ctrip. A total of 17 rooms were set at 166 Yushan Road, Shanghai (Tao LinIntersection) Motel268.However, the 6 -day stay in this hotel is very unpleasant and disputes have occurred. Although it has been negotiated for a while, it has not been resolved so far.The service of this hotel is really dare not compliment. The situation is as follows: 1. Swipe the bank card without the bob, resulting in a dispute during check -up.I have a fixed house on April 7th, 8th, and 9th. On the 7th and 8th, I swiped a credit card, because there are many fixed rooms, and the new room on the 9th is not enough because the credit card quota is not enough.The debit card, the second swiping card is not given the card, and said that it was the hotel's regulations (the front desk was placed in the file bag of my booking at the time).At noon on the 11th, I retired 16 rooms. The front desk only admitted that I had a card on the 7/8 on the 197/8. I did not admit that I had a bank card with a deposit on the 9th, and I did not pay it in one bite.It is estimated that it is lost to the bottom of the card).From another perspective, if a tenant does not pay the deposit, can it be paid to the tenant?IntersectionIntersectionis it possible?IntersectionIntersection2. The service attitude is too poor, and there is no customer -centric awareness.After the dispute occurs, there is no timely solution. The hotel's finance refuses to negotiate in person. It can only communicate with the phone. The effect is very unsatisfactory. It also refuses to check whether the dispute with the bank is scheduled to enter the hotel account. The reason is that today's cashiers are not there.3. The subsequent follow -up service speed is too slow and did not solve the problem at all.On April 11, I returned to Ningbo, that is, inquiring the account trading list in the local bank, I found out that 800 yuan was frozen in the account, so I communicated with Shanghai MOTEL Hotel.On the 15th, I checked the account opening and account with me, and called me on April 18 that I had canceled the freezing with the bank.But I called the bank early in early May. Miss Bank said that he did not receive his cancellation letter at all, otherwise the bank would be lifted immediately if you received it.Until today, the problem has not been resolved, so I have to wait for the bank to automatically lift the freezing of this pen a month later.4. Hotel cost performance is too low.There are too few personnel at the front desk (checkout and queue+check -out+inspection = 1 hour).The standard room is 288 yuan/day, not early.The buffet breakfast is 28 yuan/person (if there are fewer varieties).There is no place to eat breakfast around.The supporting facilities are very uneven.It causes our thoughts: For a business traveler who travels abroad, what is required is the service of the hotel.If there is a problem with the service of a hotel and the problem is not solved, how can we enjoy the service of this hotel?In fact, as a tourist in a different place, what we need is just the attitude of solving the problem, plus some sincerity, after all, we will not ask the hotel to make a lot of compensation.The hotel should actively resolve the leading event.In contrast, the Motel268 hotel not only did not actively and actively handle the resolution of the incident, but even shirk the responsibility of the hotel.To this day, I still did not receive any solution or email on the relevant departments and personnel of the Motel268 hotel. My account was still frozen. My phone has never sounded., Slowly flowing ............"

0,前台服的貌有待改善，做事欠效率，因三名服竟同理一位客人的，其他客人站在服台前，竟不加理，而且的欠佳、冷淡，不，不能符合四星的酒店服。酒台房的施，尤其是生，我想比三星要差，整晚睡得不好。唯一可以美的是bellboy，他的服度良好，笑容可掬。如果要500元住一晚的，在不划算。,"The appearance of the front desk service needs to be improved, and it is not efficient in doing things. Because the three clothes actually ignore the same guest, other guests stand in front of the table, but they are not reasonable, and they are not good, cold, no, not in line with the four -star’s’s’s.Hotel service.The right of the wine table is especially born. I want to be worse than Samsung and sleep well all night.The only thing that can be beautiful is Bellboy. His clothes are good and smile.If you want 500 yuan for one night, it is not cost -effective."
1,在香港的五天我把富豪东方酒店称为家，工作人员的服务态度非常好，三楼的房间是新装修的，虽然很小却相当温馨．酒店每天由收拾屋子的阿姨给免费咖啡包，红茶包享用，打个电话任何事情高效率完成．酒店周围的环境比较热闹，因为九龙城是美食天堂，所以不用担心饮食问题，周围甜品店，茶餐厅多的眼花缭乱，价格合理，服务周到．虽然离地铁不近，但是公交车四通八达，远比地铁换乘方便，酒,"In the five days in Hong Kong, I called the rich Oriental Hotel as a home. The staff's service attitude is very good. The room on the third floor is newly renovated. Although it is very small, it is quite warm.The hotel is enjoyed by the aunt who packed the house every day to enjoy the free coffee bag and black tea bag.The environment around the hotel is relatively lively. Because Kowloon City is a gourmet paradise, there is no need to worry about dietary problems. The surrounding dessert shops and tea restaurants are dazzling, reasonable, and thoughtful.Although it is not close to the subway, the buses are in all directions, which is far more convenient than the subway transfer."
1,第一次住这个酒店，感觉还不错，特别是酒店里面和周边的环境非常好！我们一家三口入住的是行政楼（四合院）标准间，（我原来订的是标准间，运气好，给我免费升级了）房间很宽敞，从房间就可以直接走到户外的庭院，早上起来走出去感觉很舒服。酒店的康乐设施也很齐全，带儿子玩了儿童乐园，沙狐球，（酒店有池塘可以钓鱼，我们没来得及去）值得一提的是酒店游泳池，很大，很舒服，据说是直接从双溪景区的水引进来净化的。晚上我们3个人到中餐厅吃饭，消费算是实惠，吃了不到200块，有一道毛笋干烧肉味道很好。总体来说，性价比很高，600多点的价格住这样一个五星（在总台看到了五星的牌子）还是很值的，推荐大家周末去度假。,"I felt pretty good for the first time, especially in the hotel and the surrounding environment!The family of three of our family is the standard room of the administrative building (courtyard courtyard).It feels comfortable when going out.The hotel's recreational facilities are also very complete. I took my son to play the children's playground, sand fox ball, (the hotel has a pond to fish, we did not have time to go).The water in the creek scenic area is introduced to purify.In the evening, we went to the Chinese restaurant to eat. The consumption was affordable. After eating less than 200 yuan, there was a dried bamboo shoots and dried meat.Generally speaking, the cost performance is very high. The price of more than 600 points is worth such a five -star (seeing a five -star brand on the head station). It is recommended that everyone go on vacation on weekends."
0,真的是一家最最不适合入住的酒店！先是服务态度的恶劣程度就不适宜入住！举个前台的小事为例：因为是海宁人，在观潮节期间有客户过来，订了二间房，先是刷卡预授权，结帐时说刷不出来了，换别的机子重新直接扣款，刷了有七八次卡才算成功，（前后大概有二十分钟吧，一点歉意也没有，反到好象是我做错了什么，不该给她出难题似的）我让她一定记得要把预授权取消，她说是30天后会自动取消，今天收到银行对帐单，扣了二次款，还得去和他们交涉。真真是烦~~再也没有下次了，海宁宾馆！,"It is really the most unsuitable hotel!First, the degree of bad service attitude is not suitable for check -in!As an example, because of Haining, a customer came over during the trend watching and ordered two rooms. First, the card was pre -authorized.It ’s successful after swiping seven or eight cards. (There are about 20 minutes before and after, there is no apology, but it seems that I have done something wrong, I should not give her a problem) I let her definitely make her definitelyI remember to cancel the pre -authorization. She said that it would be canceled automatically after 30 days. Today I received a bank statement, deducted the second paragraph, and had to negotiate with them.It's really annoying ~~ I haven't been next time, Haining Hotel!"
0,订了一房间，保险链是坏的，叫了半天没人来，还是自己修的！里面的设施显得旧了点！据说就要翻修成汉庭了，不会房价也要跟着涨吧,"After ordering a room, the insurance chain was bad. After calling for a long time, no one came, but I still repaired it myself!The facilities inside look older!It is said that it is going to be renovated into the Hanting, and the price of houses will not rise."
1,"宾馆的服务是可以的,房间的硬减设施也可以,就是电视好象应该换了!酒点的地理位置在市中心,出行非常方便!","The service of the hotel is okay, and the hard reduction facilities in the room are also possible, that is, the TV seems to be changed! The geographical location of the wine point is in the city center, and it is very convenient to travel!"
0,住了几次，价格高，房间差，床又小。要不是在携程上宜宾就这几个宾馆，我早不住了。今天去了，服务态度极差，我发誓再也不去了。郁闷,"I lived several times, the price was high, the room was poor, and the bed was small.If it weren't for Ctrip in Yibin, I wouldn't be able to stay early.I went today, and the service attitude was very poor, and I vowed never to go again.depressed"
1,"提醒大家每年10月份最好不要去香港,比平时贵太多拉!","Remind everyone that it is best not to go to Hong Kong in October each year, much more expensive than usual!"
1,一个月内已经是第二次入住了。很满意。可放设施一般，如果不是服务非常好的话，300多的价格觉得贵了。就是很好的服务让人觉得即使价格贵一点也值了。服务真的是很好，服务员都很真诚热情，你有什么要求都能得到满足。如果要提点意见的话，就是服务虽然很好，但不是很专业。,"It was already the second time in a month.very satisfied.The facilities are generally available. If the service is not very good, the price of more than 300 is expensive.It is a good service that makes people feel that even if the price is more expensive, it is worth it.The service is really good, the waiters are very sincere and enthusiastic, and you can be met if you have any requirements.If you want to make some opinions, the service is not very professional, but it is not very professional."
1,自然环境一流，宾馆内部装饰（附楼）也相当不错，说不上豪华，但是很整洁清爽。总体感觉是宁静写意。,"The natural environment is first -class, and the interior decoration of the hotel (attached building) is also quite good. It is not luxurious, but it is neat and refreshing.The overall feeling is quiet and freehand."
1,"那个廊灯确实很恐怖,半夜经常会亮起,还关不掉,问服务员,她说那灯就那样.晕","That gallery lamp is really scary, and it often lits in the middle of the night, and it can't be turned off. Ask the waiter, she said that the light is like that."
0,本以为该酒店象其名字一样豪气万千，谁承想却是名不副实。我是五一去的，酒店设施陈旧，卫生环境差。房间设备简陋陈旧，色调灰暗。算不上星级标准，也就是个旅馆，早餐品种很少，将就能吃饱，下次绝对不会再住！,"I thought the hotel was as good as its name, but whoever thought was unrealistic.I went to May Day. The hotel facilities were out of place and poor sanitary environment.The room equipment is simple and old, and the color is dark.It is not a star standard, that is, a hotel, there are very few breakfast varieties, you will be full, and you will never live again next time!"
1,香港马可最吸引人的地方当然是她便利的条件啦；附近的美心酒楼早茶很不错（就在文化中心里头），挺有特色的；马可的服务有一项细心体贴之处就是当我们办理退房手续后存包继续逛街，当大包小包拎着回到酒店取行李时，服务员很会心地把我们请到行李房最深处的一角，那里有宽大的桌椅，让你可以避免在酒店大堂中开箱、合并、装袋的尴尬举动，从容的把行李整理好再整洁的出门，真是一项贴心之举呀。,"Of course, the most attractive part of Mark Hong Kong is her convenient condition; the nearby Meixin Restaurant morning tea is very good (in the cultural center), which is quite distinctive; Marco's service has a careful consideration to be us as us as us as us.After checking out the check -up procedures, the deposit bag continues to go shopping. When the big bag is carried back to the hotel to pick up the luggage, the waiter will invite us to the deepest corner of the luggage room.Opening, merging, and bagging in the hotel lobby, it is really a thoughtful move to sorting out luggage and reorganizing."
1,房间干净、舒适、典雅，地理位置绝佳，携程的价位合理，值得入住。卫生间稍小，块头不要太大的人，应该没有问题，呵呵。,"The rooms are clean, comfortable, elegant, with excellent geographical location. The price of Ctrip is reasonable and worthy of check -in.The bathroom is slightly smaller, and people who do not have too much head should have no problem, haha."
1,酒店挺干净的，工作人员也比较热情，在楼道遇见经常面带笑容。酒店花园也比较干净。P.S非常感谢该酒店财务部门的工作人员！由于忘记拿酒店明细，我回北京以后几次打电话给该酒店前台，希望酒店能够传真给我住宿明细单，以便报销用。前台工作人员一开始说无法提供，说财务已经封帐了。后来我联系了财务部门的一位男工作人员，给了我极大的帮助，最终提供了明细单，向他表示感谢！！给前台工作人员服务分4分，给财务部门工作人员服务分10分！！！,"The hotel is very clean, and the staff is more enthusiastic, and often smiles in the corridor.The hotel garden is also relatively clean.P.S is very grateful to the staff of the hotel's financial department!Since I forgot to take the hotel details, I called the hotel front desk several times after I returned to Beijing, hoping that the hotel can fax the details of the accommodation for reimbursement.At the beginning, the staff of the front desk said that it was unable to provide it and said that the finance had been closed.Later, I contacted a male staff member of the financial department and gave me great help. Finally, I provided a detailed list and thanked him!IntersectionServe 4 points for the front desk staff and 10 points for the staff of the financial department!IntersectionIntersection"
1,感觉不错，舒适、卫生、安全方面都不错，只是晚上夜深时外面马路的汽车路过声扰人。,"It feels good, comfortable, hygienic and safety are good, but the cars on the outside of the night are passing by the road outside the night."
0,友好，干净－－太讽刺了！一进房间看到马桶的水是黄色的。因为想要个能上网的电源插座，被前台数落了一顿。说如果我是刚入住时要求可以帮我想办法，现在没办法了。所以一晚上无法开电脑工作。其它细节相对这两点来说就好多了。比如电视不能用遥控器彻底关掉，要下床关，床头灯一个不亮，半夜有人敲对面的门从睡梦中被敲醒看表12：58分，电梯里面有人吸烟，开发票不给写抬头。,"Friendly, clean -too ironic!As soon as I entered the room, I saw that the water in the toilet was yellow.Because I wanted a power socket that could access the Internet, a number of front desk was counted.It is said that if I just moved in, I could help me find a way, but now there is no way.So I couldn't turn on the computer for a night.Other details are much better than these two points.For example, the TV cannot be completely turned off with a remote control. You need to get off the bed. The bedside light is not bright. Someone knocked on the opposite door in the middle of the night and woke up from the sleep to see Table 12:58.Write up."
1,饭店后面正在建贵宾楼，而酒店本身内部有些陈旧，不过总体酒店硬件还行，房间的地毯较脏，卫生间洗手池下方惨不忍睹；早餐是中西自助式，尤其是羊杂做得很好吃。但是酒店的服务水平和服务人员的素质离4星的水准还相差太远。,"The hotel is built behind the hotel, and the hotel itself is a bit old, but the overall hotel's hardware is okay. The carpet in the room is dirty, and the bathroom washing pool is terrible. The breakfast is a Chinese and Western self -service type, especially the sheep is delicious.However, the level of the hotel's service and the quality of the service personnel is too far away from the level of 4 stars."
1,入住的是商务套房，虽然没有协程上写的72平米那么大，但是52平米的布局和装修等等都非常得满意。套房里还有免费软饮，免费洗衣(一定的金额内)，所以说还是物有所值。地方虽然不靠海，但是我住的32楼可以看到海，而且离青岛最有名的美食街云霄路可以不行，所以说虽然没有海边度假村的那么休闲，但是地理位置还是相当的不错。,"The business suite is checked. Although there is no 72 square meters written on the coroutine, the layout and decoration of 52 square meters are very satisfied.There are also free soft drinks, free laundry (within a certain amount) in the suite, so it is still worthwhile.Although the place is not dependent on the sea, I can see the sea on the 32nd floor of I live, and it can not be done from the most famous food street in Qingdao. Therefore, although it is not as casual as the seaside resort, the geographical location is quite good."
0,"定的行政房间正对杂物间,们一直敞着,别提多脏乱.要求换房后,房间空调不制冷,冰箱向推土机,要求再换,门口楼道铺了块巨大脏布,因为隔壁在装修,不知携程和这个酒店有什么过节,总感觉是在故意让你难受,另外所有房间的电话没有内线指示,竟让客人用长途打回酒店转接,我靠!还有五星级的小姐怎么那么..真是影响北京市容和奥运的和谐环境,房间的餐厅送餐味道会叫你吐出来的.这是本人目前住过的最让人""难忘的""酒店.这些话本人已经在克制了.","The fixed administrative room is facing the debris room, and we have been opening up, not to mention how dirty.

In addition, all room ’s phone has no inside instructions, and the guests are allowed to go back to the hotel with long distances.Why so .. It really affects the harmonious environment of Beijing Rong and Olympic Games. The food delivery taste of the restaurant in the room will be called you vomiting. This is the most memorable ""hotel.

1,"关于PriorityClub之事,当时承诺1个月卡会寄存","Regarding PriorityClub, at the time, the card was promised to be stored for one month."
0,"肯定我不会再住这里了,太陈旧了,霉味太重,感觉不好!","I certainly won't live here anymore, too old, the moldy taste is too heavy, it feels bad!"
1,大堂有点小，房间还不错，定的是商务套，客厅很大，还有小厨房可以根据需求使用，卧室很小。饭店出去，沿右手一条小区里的小路一直走到路边左拐，有个茶餐厅，还不错。,"The lobby is a bit small, the room is not bad, the business set is set, the living room is large, and the kitchen can be used according to needs, and the bedroom is small.When the restaurant goes out, walk along the small road in a community on the right hand to the side of the road. There is a tea restaurant, which is not bad."
1,"不错,住过几次了,值得推荐!酒店外就有超市买东西挺方便的:)","Yes, I have lived a few times, it is worth recommending! It is convenient to buy things outside the hotel :)"
1,感觉还不错，虽然不算新也不算豪华。地下一层的桑那按摩（当然应该是独立经营的）骗钱，故意不说要加房间钱。,"It feels pretty good, although it is not new and not luxurious.The Sanga massage (of course should be operated independently) to cheat money on the first floor of the ground, and deliberately said it to add room money."
0,"这不是星级酒店,而是一间很差的招待所.早餐很","This is not a star hotel, but a poor guest house. Breakfast is very good"
1,"周末刚从阳朔回来,住了三天,感觉性价比还可以.地理位置不错,西街和新西街交界口,吃饭逛街都很方便;服务也很好,前台和客房都彬彬有礼的,房间也算干净;中式早餐还凑合.美中不足是房间不大,设施和床具毛巾等都旧了一些,空调开久了房间还有点不太好的味道.总体来说比较满意,我和老公一致认为可以给四分.","I just returned from Yangshuo on the weekend. I lived for three days. It feels that the price -performance ratio is okay. The geographical location is good. West Street and Xinxi Street junction.

The shortcomings of the United States are not large in the room, the facilities and bedding towels are older. The air conditioner has a bad taste after a long time.Can give four points."
1,在宜昌算是还不错的酒店，大堂也很漂亮，房间都还ok．如果将来来看三峡，应该是不错的选择．不过携程的价格没什么优势，朋友通过当地的公司代定的房间，跟携程的价格相比差了差不多一百块．,"It is a good hotel in Yichang, and the lobby is also very beautiful, and the rooms are OK.If you look at the Three Gorges in the future, it should be a good choice.However, the price of Ctrip has no advantage. Friends have been compared with the price of Ctrip through the price of the local company."
0,严重的名不副实，所谓的准四星级差距太大。入住豪华大床间，房间小的只有一张床的位置，卫生间小的淋浴空间甚至转不开身。房屋隔音太差，隔壁两人说话的声音清晰入耳，楼道中服务员交谈的声音远远就能听到。餐厅小强横跑，哪儿还有心情吃得下去？这儿根本就不是个酒店，感觉像是KTV改造的，不行不行，太差了！,"The serious name is not true, and the so -called quasi -four -star gap is too large.In the luxury bed, there is only one bed in the small room, and the small shower space of the bathroom cannot even turn around.The sound insulation of the house is too poor. The voice of the two people talking about the sound is clear, and the voice of the waiter talked in the corridor can hear.The restaurant Xiaoqiang runs horizontally, where can I still feel mood?It's not a hotel at all. It feels like KTV transformation."
0,我是今年三月在这家酒店入住的，没想到被骗了，我睡到半夜的时候房间的空调就“嗒嗒“。。。地响个不停，象拖拉机一样。当我打电话去前台的时候，服务员说你描述一下怎么个响法，我只有把电话拿到空调旁边让他听，谁知道他说你等等吧，我让电工过去给你看看修修就好了（老大，当时零晨4点啊，晕死），然后早餐时我见过最烂的早餐，连街边的地摊都不如，下次大家千万不要入住，切忌切忌。宾馆反馈2008年4月23日：首先感谢您对本酒店提出的宝贵意见，关于空调噪音只是个别现象，对于我们服务不周之处还请谅解；另外关于您对我们西餐的意见，我们将对西餐厅进行装修整改，全面丰富西餐菜式，相信下次入住一定可以让您满意，期待您的再次光临。,"I stayed at this hotel in March this year. I didn't expect to be deceived. When I slept until midnight, the room's air conditioner was ""tight"".EssenceEssenceThe ground rang constantly, like a tractor.When I called to the front desk, the waiter said that you described how to say. I only had to take the phone next to the air conditioner and let him listen.That's it (boss, at 4 am at the time, fainted), and then I saw the worst breakfast during breakfast. Even the street stalls were not as good as the street. Do n’t check in next time, do n’t take care of it.Hotel feedback on April 23, 2008: First of all, thank you for your valuable opinions on the hotel. Regarding the noise of air conditioning is only individual phenomenon, please forgive me where we have no services;The restaurant is rectified and rectified to comprehensively enrich the western meal. I believe that the next time you stay will definitely make you satisfactory and look forward to your visit again."
1,在市中心，逛街吃饭都挺方便。服务不错，标间设施略旧。,"In the city center, it is convenient to eat and eat.The service is good, and the bidding facilities are slightly old."
1,出差过去，这店离开发区近，离机场也近，离市区太远，订了套房，外面刮风，呼呼的想，有点害怕，饭店设施还行，但生意冷清，没有多少人气，早饭比较差，基本没什么可吃的东西！,"In the past, this shop was close to the development zone and was close to the airport. It was too far from the city. I booked a suite. It was windy outside. I thought it was a bit scared. The restaurant facilities were okay, but the business was deserted.Breakfast is poor, basically there is nothing to eat!"
1,房间非常宽畅，服务也很好，喜欢住酒店式公寓。离李公堤、金鸡湖很方便，开车5分钟。室内游泳池不大，但水温挺高，适合小孩子玩。金鸡湖很漂亮，周边餐厅、酒吧、还有OUTLETS，无论中午还是晚上，选择在靠窗望湖的座位用餐，让人心情放松而愉快。,"The room is very wide and the service is also very good. I like to live in a hotel -style apartment.It is very convenient to leave Li Gongdi and Jinji Lake, 5 minutes by car.The indoor swimming pool is not large, but the water temperature is very high, suitable for children to play.Jinji Lake is very beautiful. The surrounding restaurants, bars, and outlets. Whether at noon or at night, choose to eat at the seat of the window to look at the lake, which makes people feel relaxed and happy."
0,强烈不推荐本酒店。通过携程预定了一间大床房，房价580元，单早，增加一份早餐68元，当时我们以为五星标准。晚上飞机误点，到达酒店已经11点多了，以为在郊县，外面看酒店灯光昏暗，真没看出五星标准，相比上海的一些三星还不如。壮着胆子进了酒店，只有一位女服务生在前台。然后在只有我们两个人的情况下，花十几分钟给我们办好了入住手续。我们因为没吃晚饭，打算去市区吃宵夜。居然--酒店外面没有出租车了。当时晚上十二点左右。而且马路上没人没车。（烟台机场到酒店的时候，叫的出租车的驾驶员说华美达酒店到市区车程大约三十分钟，我们从机场到酒店花了二十分钟。）只好先进房间叫餐，幸亏还有叫餐服务。进了房间，真的吓一跳，装修还不错，可是面积奇小，一张普通大床加床头柜居然占据了房间一半的面积。打开窗户，看到的是酒店内部中庭。叫餐也是单子上的几乎没有，只有几种炒饭和面。我们恍惚不是身处城市。但是这可是我出发前认真选择的，大家好评如潮的酒店呀。吃饭的时候我找到了原因：写字台上有一张广告，上面内容是购买我们入住的酒店，可以代为管理营业，又可以每年用于自住N天，是一种理想的投资方式。原来这个酒店是由很多个人购买的，由酒店集中管理经营的，收益是回报那些购买者的。这大概就是好评如潮的原因了：谁不想自己的投资有个好回报啊。至于次日68元一份的早餐，五星收费，三星标准。我们第三天在威海的四星酒店早餐，比这里好些，收28元每位。概况地说：酒店交通不便，服务一般，装修较新较时尚，如果房价在三百以下，客人又不需要去市区的，还是可以入住的。宾馆反馈2008年8月7日：23点以后，酒店外的灯只保留照明路灯；夜间总台有两名员工当班，出现1名员工服务，是因为另一名员工暂时有事离岗；希望客人谅解！酒店的西餐厅提供送餐服务，西餐品种较多，酒店会考虑适时增加部分中餐品种。,"This hotel is not recommended.A large bed room was scheduled through Ctrip, with a house price of 580 yuan, and a single breakfast was added to 68 yuan. At that time, we thought the five -star standard.At night, the plane was wrong. It was more than 11 o'clock in the hotel. I thought that in the suburbs and counties, the lights were dim at the hotel outside. I did not see the five -star standard. Compared with some Samsung in Shanghai, it was not as good.Strongly entered the hotel, only one female waiter was at the front desk.Then, in the case of only two of us, spent more than ten minutes for us to check in.Because we didn't have dinner, we planned to go to the urban area for supper.Actually-there is no taxi outside the hotel.At around 12 pm.And no one on the road has no cars.(When Yantai Airport arrived at the hotel, the driver of the taxi said that the Huameda Hotel arrived in the urban area for about 30 minutes.Meal service.After entering the room, it was really startled. The decoration was not bad, but the area was very small. A ordinary large bed with bedside table actually occupied half of the room.Open the window and see the internal atrium of the hotel.There are almost no meals on the list, there are only a few kinds of fried rice and noodles.We are not in the city.But this is what I chose carefully before departure. Everyone praised the hotel.I found the reason when eating: There is an advertisement on the writing desk. The above content is to buy a hotel we stayed in. It can be managed on behalf of the business and can be used for N -day self -occupation. It is an ideal way of investment.It turned out that this hotel was purchased by many individuals and was managed by the hotel centrally. The income returned to those buyers.This is probably the reason for the well -received: who doesn't want to have a good return.As for the breakfast of 68 yuan the next day, five -star charges, Samsung standard.On the third day, we had breakfast at the four -star hotel in Weihai on the third day than here.Overview: Hotel traffic is inconvenient, services are generally new, and decoration is relatively fashionable. If house prices are less than 300, guests do not need to go to the urban area, they can still stay.Hotel feedback on August 7, 2008: After 23 o'clock, the lights outside the hotel only retain the lighting street lights; there are two employees at night at night, and one employee service appears because another employee will leave the post for the time being.understanding!The hotel's western restaurant provides food delivery services. There are many varieties of Western food. The hotel will consider adding some Chinese food varieties in a timely manner."
1,房间比较宽敞，很干净；后面是小区，比较安静，但是前面是垃圾场我昨天住的时候，特价房没有了，还免费帮我升级到了商务房188这个价钱，太值了；我已经住了3晚，还准备再住如果前台的服务态度再好一些就好了宾馆反馈2008年8月15日：期待您的下次入住为您提供更加优质的服务!酒店祝您工作顺利!身体健康!,"The rooms are relatively spacious and clean; the neighborhood is relatively quiet, but when I lived in the dump yesterday, the special room was gone, and I helped me upgrade to the price of the business house for free.Three nights, you are going to live again. If the service attitude of the front desk is better, it is better. The hotel feedback on August 15, 2008: Looking forward to your next check -in to provide you with better service! Hotels wish you a smooth work! Good health!"
1,周围环境有些乱，但是很热闹吃饭的地方也比较多。房间还可以。,"The surrounding environment is a bit messy, but there are more places to eat.The room is ok."
1,作为4星酒店装修虽较陈旧但还可以。客房各等设备齐全。交通以的士为主。到火车站7元，关城10元，还算方便。餐厅服务态度不错，我们回来晚了，餐厅就要下班了，但仍给我们炒了拨鱼子。仅14元的生意，等了我们半天。对前台的服务就不敢恭维，非常不喜欢使用信用卡的旅客。要求我交现金，并告知使用信用卡授权无法取消。被逼无奈，我拿出钱夹给她看，里面只有130多元。这位前台登记人员竞要求我给她100元现金，就没想想我要出去吃个宵夜，打个车咋办？在我的一再坚持下，才使用了信用卡授权。其实在使用授权，及后来的取消授权和结账都非常快捷，没有丝毫的麻烦。但就不明白她为什么不让我用信用卡。就为这点事情足足耽误了好几分钟。还一再让我们在预定房价的基础上加10元可以什么随便打电话，难道我们来嘉峪关旅游就是为了在酒店里煲电话粥吗？我没同意，我告诉他我希望按预定的价格，她说那就没房了，但我说如果你不给我安排，我会去携程投诉。一听这话房子又有了。,"Although the decoration of the 4 -star hotel is more old but it is okay.The rooms and other equipment are complete.Traffic is dominated by scholars.At 7 yuan to the railway station, Guancheng 10 yuan, which is quite convenient.The restaurant's service attitude is good. When we come back late, the restaurant is about to get off work, but we still stir -fry the caviar.Only 14 yuan of business, waiting for us for a long time.I dare not compliment the front desk, and I don't like to use a credit card passenger.I asked me to pay cash and informed that the use of credit card authorization could not be canceled.Forced to be helpless, I took out the money clip to see her, there were only 130 yuan inside.The front desk registered staff asked me to give her 100 yuan cash, so I didn't think about me going out for a supper. What should I do if I get a car?With my repeated persistence, I used credit card authorization.In fact, the use of authorization, and the later cancellation authorization and checkout are very fast, without any trouble.But I don't understand why she doesn't let me use a credit card.It took several minutes for this matter.Let's have repeatedly let us add 10 yuan to the booked house price. Can we call it casually? Is it to come to Jiayuguan to travel in the hotel to make a phone porridge?I didn't agree, I told him that I wanted to be at the scheduled price. She said that there was no house, but I said that if you don't arrange for me, I will go to Ctrip to complain.When I heard this, the house was there again."
1,继续再次点评，其他都跟以前一样，只是对于前台的服务速度希望再快一点，多给人一点笑脸！亲和力不够！其他没什么，还是值得推荐！,"Continue to comment again, the others are the same as before, but the service speed of the front desk is faster, giving a little more smile!Not enough affinity!There is nothing else, it is worth recommending!"

It is inconvenient to go to the restaurant and the route is complicated. The breakfast is expensive, and there are no types of choice."
0,在北京住过不下10多家酒店，也喜欢住公寓，从凯宾斯基到建国饭店，从京广到美华再到星城亮马，而这个是我住过的有史以来最差的一个酒店公寓。难怪价格不上不下，不是因为临时有事绝对不住，希望这里那么多好评语不是枪手1、入口难找到要死不说，大堂感觉就是某个买小商品的商铺，checkin竟然要压证件，没有听说过，坚决不同意拿了我的证件去复印。私人住宿和旅客混杂，拖着箱子看着买菜回来的人一同电梯很奇怪。2、半夜接到骚扰电话3、房间设计装饰非常的“家常“，设施陈旧，非常像当年在江南古镇租住的农家房3、住的房间刚好在过道口，声音那叫一个大阿，谁说的房间隔音？楼上住户的动静镇清楚啊4、服务态度不好，和客人顶着说，铁板一样的语气。5，实在要找一优点出来的话：唯一就是小区里面比较安静，没有汽车闹声。,"There are no less than 10 hotels in Beijing, and I like to live in apartments. From Kobezki to Jianguo Hotel, from Beijing -Guangzhou to Meihua to Xingcheng Liangma, and this is the worst hotel I have lived in history.apartment.No wonder the price can't be up, not because there is something temporary, I hope so many good comments here are not the gunmen. 1. The entrance is difficult to find to die. The lobby feels like a shop that buys a small product.After, I resolutely disagreed with my document to copy.Private accommodation is mixed with passengers, and it is strange to drag the box and watch the people who buy food.2. Receive the harassment phone number in the middle of the night 3. The room design decoration is very ""home -often"", and the facilities are old. It is very similar to the farmhouse rented in the ancient town of Jiangnan. The room where the living room is just in the aisle.Speaking room sound insulation?The dynamic and quiet seal of the residents upstairs is clear. 4. The service attitude is not good, and they say the same tone as the guests.5. If you really want to find an advantage: The only thing is that the community is relatively quiet and there is no car noise."
1,在邯郸可能是最好的宾馆了，紧靠市政府，交通便利。但是政府或各组织的会议太多太多，经常都订不到房间。而且旁边在建新楼，外部环境不是很好。蚊子非常厉害，灭蚊片一片不起作用。强烈建议携程网在邯郸再签一个宾馆，国际饭店，也还不错，比另外一个邯郸大酒店好一些。但是要把她的房价压一点，就因为有宽带，在国际饭店就成了商务间，350元，控制在280元左右。,"It may be the best hotel in Handan, which is close to the municipal government and is convenient for transportation.However, there are too many meetings of the government or organizations, and they often cannot book a room.And the new building is under construction, the external environment is not very good.The mosquito is very powerful, and the mosquito extinguisher does not work.It is strongly recommended that Ctrip.com signed another hotel in Handan. The international hotel is also good, which is better than another Handan Hotel.But to press her house price a little, because there is a broadband, it becomes a business room in the international hotel, 350 yuan, and controls at about 280 yuan."
1,"酒店交通便利,房间早餐都很不错,但隔音效果不行.补充点评2007年12月22日：豪华双人间的床很大，舒服。在26的房间里看夜色还是不错的。","The hotel's transportation is convenient, the room breakfast is very good, but the sound insulation effect is not good. Supplementary reviews December 22, 2007: The luxury double room bed is very large and comfortable.It is still good to watch the night in the 26 room."
1,房间太小，服务不错。在王府井能这样就不错了,The room is too small and the service is good.This is pretty good in Wangfujing
1,酒店占地面积很大，号称花园式。住的迎宾楼，条件很一般，还算干净。一楼，没有宽带，据说三、四楼才有。因为提前订好，到达时一看，要求加的床已经提前加好，还不错。考虑到是在安庆，房价也还便宜，一切都不计较了。,"The hotel covers a large area and is known as a garden style.The conditions for living are very average and clean.On the first floor, there is no broadband. It is said that it is only on the third and fourth floors.Because it is booked in advance, and when you arrive, the bed that requires the addition has been added in advance, which is not bad.Considering that in Anqing, house prices are also cheap, everything is not counted."
0,刚刚入住就有服务员开门进来问是否要退房，搞到你欲哭无泪，管理肯定有问题，硬件也没有别人说的好，退房的时候遇到其他的退房客才200元一间，郁闷！下次不住这里了。,"Just now, some waiters open the door and ask if you want to leave the house. You must cry without tears, there must be problems with management, and the hardware is not as good as others. When you check out, you will only encounter other check -ups.,depressed!I can't stop here next time."
1,目前在江门的4星级酒店中性价比较高的。周边吃饭购物都比较方便。酒店设施比较旧。,"At present, the 4 -star hotel in Jiangmen is relatively cost -effective.It is more convenient to eat and shop around.The hotel facilities are relatively old."
1,我每次到惠州都住在这家酒店，今年发现有二点要改进：1、拖鞋太差，一穿就抽丝，还缠在脚上。2、床架要固定好一些，半夜里隔壁房间动静太大，影响邻居休息。,"Every time I go to Huizhou, I live in this hotel. This year I found that there are two points to improve: 1. Slippers are too bad. As soon as I wear it, I pump on my feet.2. The bed rack should be fixed. In the middle of the night, the movement in the room next door is too large, which affects the neighbor's rest."
0,非常不愉快的入住。朋友是晚上11：30左右到达的，此时的柜台服务只有1人，连服务生整个大堂只有3个人，因为年纪比较大，本来行李想让服务生帮忙，招手示意后他们竟然不理睬并且跑开。checkin的时候连刷两张信用卡竟然说信用卡不能用，很莫名其妙。房间的设施极差，灯光很暗，酒店的东西非常破旧，真是有损5星级的标准。难怪朋友会说这家酒店的客人非常少，都吓跑掉了。还是在繁华的南京路附近，真是丢人。,"Very unpleasant to stay.Friends arrived at around 11:30 pm. At this time, there were only one counter service at this time, and there were only 3 people in the entire lobby of the waiter. Because they were older, they wanted to help the waiter. After beckoning, they ignored and ran.open.When you checkin, swipe two credit cards even say that the credit card cannot be used, which is inexplicable.The facilities in the room are very poor, the lights are very dark, and the hotel's things are very shabby. It is really a standard for 5 stars.No wonder friends will say that there are very few guests in this hotel, and they are scared away.It is still shame near the bustling Nanjing Road."
1,从广州第四次来仙湖。仙湖不仅环境好，还可以随意停车。（主楼的停车场有保安看守）广州来这里几乎全程高速。渔人码头物美价廉，我儿子非常喜欢吃那里13元的扬州炒饭。而且餐厅外有停车场，并设有棚帐，不怕烈日炎炎。只是自助早餐一般般。总体来说，真不错！补充点评2008年8月4日：我们入住的是378元的悠闲高级房套餐，住在北楼。,"Come from Xianhu for the fourth time in Guangzhou.Xianhu not only has a good environment, but also can park at will.(The parking lot in the main building is a security guard) Guangzhou is almost at high speed here.Fisherman's dock is good and cheap. My son likes to eat Yangzhou fried rice at 13 yuan there.In addition, there is a parking lot outside the restaurant and a shed tent.It's just a buffet breakfast.Overall, it's nice!Supplementary comment on August 4, 2008: We stayed at a leisurely high -end house package of 378 yuan, living in the North Tower."
1,总体感觉还可以，就是觉得性价比不是很高！如果价格可以再低点就不错了。,"The overall feeling is OK, I just feel that the price / performance ratio is not very high!If the price can be low, it is good."
1,6月30日入住的。房间总体还行，就是有点旧。周围环境较好。服务方面，门童帮忙开车门倒是挺勤快，可惜不知道帮忙拎行李。特别表扬早餐比较好。总的来说，感觉可以是3星+的标准，但算不上4星,"Stayed on June 30.The overall room is okay, but it is a bit old.The surrounding environment is better.In terms of service, Men Tong helped to drive the door and was very diligent, but unfortunately I didn't know how to help carry luggage.It is better to praise breakfast.Overall, it feels like a 3 -star+standard, but it is not 4 stars"
1,"地理位置不,服务态度一般,房了,体普普通通","The geographical location is not, the service attitude is average, the room is, and the physical is ordinary"
0,因了地理位置不错，定了这家酒店，也曾上网看过其他人的点评，总不相信真有这么糟，待得自己亲自住了、感受了，才真的体会到，这里还真不能算是一家酒店！没有门头（门前一滩脏水），所谓的大堂和前台（只有一位服务员忙碌地守着电脑和电话），狭小的电梯，廉价且肮脏的地毯，这还不是最坏的。穿过幽暗的走廊，打开房门，房间很大，空空荡荡没什么家具，但卫生间搞得超小，洗手盆放在外面，所以洗澡时没地方搁衣服。冲淋房密封差，一个人用过后第二个人根本走不进，地上全是水！房间的墙壁有些剥落，还有斑斑血迹的蚊子尸体。勉强睡了一晚，第二天的早饭也惨不忍睹，还不如不含！,"Because the geographical location is good, I have settled this hotel, and I have seen other people’s reviews on the Internet. I do n’t believe it ’s so bad. I have to live and feel it in person.A hotel!There is no door (a dirty water in front of the door), the so -called lobby and front desk (only one waiter is busy guarding the computer and phone), a small elevator, a cheap and dirty carpet, which is not the worst.Passing through the dark corridor, opening the door, the room is large, there is no furniture in empty, but the bathroom is super small, and the washbasin is placed outside, so there is no place to put it in the bath.The sealing of the punching room is poor. After a person's use, the second person can not go in at all, and the ground is full of water!The walls of the room were peeled off, and the mosquito bodies with blood stains were peeled.I barely slept for a night, and the breakfast the next day was terrible, it might as well not include it!"
1,"总体感觉不错.只是入住时收音机调节钮不能使用,打电话请工程部维修后才能听音乐,5颗星不应该这样.地灯也不亮,没有再计较.",Overall feels good. It is just that the radio adjustment button cannot be used when check -in. Call the engineering department for repair before listening to music. 5 stars should not be like this. The floor lanterns are not bright and no more.
0,这家的位置还不错，去景点比较方便。老板很热情，店里搞网络的小伙子服务也很周到，还是那位可爱纯朴的服务员“葫芦”。但是设施实在是太差了，不知老板什么本事居然搞了牌三星，我看就是一个农家乐吧。饭菜的价格高得离谱，即使在景区也太过分了，而且口味很差。不过据说要新建和改造了，希望老板今后搞得要好一点。另外，我这次外出在景区都是通过携程订的，价格太高，一般的都要300左右一天。现在景区都到了淡季，房源宽裕，价格较低。自己到当地订的话只要100左右。建议携程在这方面要注意一下，不然今后真的不敢在你这儿订房了。,"The location of this house is not bad, it is more convenient to go to the attractions.The boss is very enthusiastic. The service of the young man in the store is also very thoughtful, and the cute and simple waiter ""Gourd"".But the facilities are too bad. I do n’t know what the boss actually has a brand Samsung. I think it ’s a farmhouse.The price of meals is high, even in the scenic area, and the taste is poor.However, it is said that it is going to be newly built and renovated. I hope the boss will make better in the future.In addition, this time I went out in the scenic area through Ctrip. The price was too high, and it usually took about 300 a day.Nowadays, the scenic spots are in the off -season. The listings are rich and the price is low.It only costs about 100 if you order it yourself.It is recommended to pay attention to Ctrip in this regard, otherwise you really dare not book a house in the future."
0,家庭式旅馆，吵架，不干净。莫干山庄很好，但是携程上没有，还有山上有10多家酒店，携程只有2－3家，选择的余地太小。携程你要加油啊！,"Family hotels, quarrel, not clean.Mogan Mountain Villa is very good, but there are no more than 10 hotels on the mountains. There are only 2-3 of Ctrip. The room for choosing is too small.Ctrip, you want to cheer!"
1,"呼和浩特的HOLIDAYINN绝对超过我的预期,原先以为内陆城市条件会差些呢.酒店感觉挺新的,住的是豪华房,它有专门的楼层,好象是六楼和七楼.八楼和九楼是行政楼层.房间挺大的,最令我吃惊的是,我的房间可以免费每天饮用4罐冰箱里的软饮料,另外可以每天免费洗两件衣服.CHECKIN&OUT的速度也挺快的,总体感觉挺不错.酒店内的中餐厅和西餐厅也不错,价格也合理.呼和浩特的HOLIDAY在中国的HOLIDAYINN里绝对是可以的,甚至比有些城市的CROWNEPLAZA还好些呢.","Holidayinn in Hohhot surpassed my expectations. Originally, the conditions for inland cities would be worse. The hotel feels quite new, and it is a luxury room. It has a special floor, as if it is the sixth floor and the seventh floor.The ninth floor is the administrative floor. The room is quite large. What surprises me the most is that my room can drink 4 soft drinks in the refrigerator every day for free. In addition, you can wash two clothes for free every day. Checkin & ut.It feels pretty good. The Chinese restaurants and Western restaurants in the hotel are also good, and the price is reasonable. Holiday in Hohhot is definitely OK in Holidayinn in China. It is even better than Crowneplaza in some cities."
1,"31号与同事分别入住新冀和温泉岛别墅.房间还是比较大,不过细节方面有点马虎,别墅浴室的里的壁灯都东倒西歪,毛巾架摇摇欲坠,让人看着有点难过.这么漂亮的别墅,有点像绣花枕头了.而且查房速度太慢.结帐等太久.让人生气.新冀离温泉谷比较远,不提供浴袍有点奇怪.温泉区想换条干爽的毛巾是一件困难的事.不理解","No. 31 and colleagues stayed in Xinji and Hot Spring Island Villas. The room was still relatively large, but the details were a bit sloppy.Like embroidered pillows. And the speed of the room is too slow. The checkout is too long. It makes people angry. Xinji is far from the hot spring valley. It is a bit strange to not provide bathrobes.Things. Don't understand"
0,"后悔!不值!唯一优点交通方便.在很深的小巷里,楼下浴足,恶心!建议取消","Regret! Not worth it! The only advantage of traffic is convenient. In a deep alley, the bath is full, nausea! It is recommended to cancel"
0,大堂太让人失望了.房间也很小.性价比超低.下次不会再住了.,The lobby is too disappointing. The room is also very small. The cost performance is super low. I won't live again next time.
0,春节期间入住，感觉硬件环境还马马虎虎，但是酒店服务太差，名为温泉度假村，但是对住店客人没有任何泡温泉的优惠和优先措施。1、住店客人与非住店客人一样需要购买温泉票，而且如果入住当晚上和第二天早上都想去泡温泉还需要买两张温泉票，按理对住店客人完全应该有去温泉的绿色通道，否则住度假村就没有意义了2、泡温泉还需要在前台换钥匙，我去换的时候有很多非住店的来泡温泉的人在排队，我就跟前台说应该给我们住店客人优先，但是前台小姐居然不愿意，我怒斥了几句后最终还是给我优先办了，真是岂有此理，住他们酒店还得不到应有的服务3、前台的服务意识淡薄，我入住时问前台小姐能不能第二天稍微晚点退房，并让她去问经理，结果她去问了经理之后根本就不回答我，我问她她还说以为了已经走了，我就站在她面前！总之，这个温泉度假村实在让人不敢恭维，服务质量绝对配不上它的外表，以后不太会再选择它了。,"During the Spring Festival, I felt that the hardware environment was still sloppy, but the hotel service was too poor. It was called a hot spring resort, but there were no preferential and priority measures for the guests in the store.1. Store guests need to buy hot spring tickets like non -residential guests, and if you want to go to the hot spring that night and the next morning, you need to buy two hot spring tickets.Green channels, otherwise the resort will have no sense. 2. Hot springs need to change the key at the front desk. When I change it, there are many non -living shops who come to the hot spring.The guests are preferred, but the lady at the front desk is unwilling. After I scolded a few words, I finally gave me the first one.Can the front desk lady check out a little later the next day and asked her to ask the manager. As a result, she did not answer me after asking the manager. I asked her that she said that she had gone, and I stood in front of her, so I stood in front of herIntersectionIn short, this hot spring resort is really dare not compliment. The service quality is definitely not worthy of its appearance, and it will not be able to choose it again in the future."
0,这是我住过的最差的4星级酒店，酒店原本是3星的，经过装修，但骨子里就是3星的，床，水龙头，房间的家具，地毯等等细节可以看出来。最可恨的是，我7月12日晚上和朋友喝酒，回到酒店已经3点多，在携程定了机票，要求明天早送过来，早上10点不到，携程送票员上酒店送票，可是门卫不给，说酒店只让他们的保安才可以送，其他人拒绝上门，要求我自己下去取票，我头痛得厉害，叫他们帮忙和自己协调，h后来了几个电话，但始终没有解决。最后只好投诉他们副理：酒店晚上2-3点还有小姐到处走，到处弄没有人管，人家为客人送票你们的狗就要管，什么酒店啊。后来才知道，那门口的狗是想索要小费。离开时，前台服务员的态度也不好。到了门口，狗来了要我坐酒店的车去机场，从150讲到80元，我告诉他，别人的我坐，你介绍的我就不坐。。。,"This is the worst 4 -star hotel I have lived. The hotel was originally 3 stars. After decoration, I can see the details of 3 stars, beds, faucets, room furniture, carpets and other details.The most hateful thing is that I drank with my friends on the evening of July 12 and returned to the hotel for more than 3 o'clock. I set a ticket at Ctrip and asked to send it early tomorrow.However, the gatekeeper did not give it, and said that the hotel can only send their security guards. Others refused to come to the door and asked me to go to pick up the ticket by myself. I had a headache and asked them to help them coordinate with myself.solve.In the end, they had to complain about their deputy manager: the hotel was walking around at 2-3 pm, and no one cared about it everywhere. People sent your dogs to your dogs to control the guests. What hotels?Later, I learned that the dog at the door wanted to ask for a tip.When leaving, the attitude of the front desk was not good.At the door, the dog came to the airport that I asked me to take the hotel. From 150 to 80 yuan, I told him that I would sit on the other people, and I would not sit.EssenceEssence"
1,服务态度不错。我住的是数码房，房间很宽敞，网速有点卡。建议以后在客人入住时即办理早餐券，避免早晨退房的和办早餐券的扎堆挤在一起。服务员忙得不可开交，客人们等得火冒三丈。宾馆反馈2008年7月16日：尊敬的宾客：您好！感谢您对酒店提出的宝贵意见。酒店今后会在高峰时间段适当的增加人手，以减少客人等待的时间，谢谢您对我们工作的理解和支持。,"The service attitude is good.I live in a digital room. The room is very spacious and the network speed is a bit stuck.It is recommended to apply for breakfast vouchers when guests stay in to avoid squeezing with the morning check -in and breakfast coupons.The waiter was too busy, and the guests waited for the fire.Hotel feedback on July 16, 2008: Dear guest: Hello!Thank you for your precious opinions on the hotel.In the future, the hotel will appropriately increase the hands at the peak period to reduce the time for guests to wait. Thank you for your understanding and support for our work."
0,图了离火车站近，不能太苛求。不过即使再住一定要住新楼。老楼好像属于文物一类，伪满时期建的？整体阴暗、楼道曲折、房间狭小、服务恶劣、还有骚扰电话。,"The picture is close to the railway station, not too demanding.But even if you live again, you must live in a new building.The old building seems to belong to cultural relics, built during the pseudo -Manchu period?The overall darkness, the twists and turns of the corridor, the small room, the bad service, and the harassment call."
1,朋友推荐的酒店，位置不错，交通很方便，酒店的服务也很贴心，入住时前台适时地送上一杯冰柠檬茶，让人感受到酒店的细心服务，夏日的夜晚坐在露天啤酒花园喝着啤酒，与朋友畅谈很是惬意。,"The hotel recommended by a friend is good in location, convenient transportation, and the hotel's service is very intimate. When you check in, you give a cup of ice lemon tea at the front desk to make people feel the careful service of the hotel. Sitting in the open -air beer garden to drinkBeing beer is very comfortable to talk to friends."
1,1、总体感觉有些旧，地毯上污迹比较多。2、服务等还可以。3、房间总带有一些烟味，不喜欢。,"1. Overall feel a little old, and there are more stains on the carpet.2. Service, etc.3. The room always has some smoke flavor and does not like it."
1,非常好的外部环境，美丽的云龙湖，度假感强烈，让人很放松，很惬意。只是湖景房要在总台申明，否则，湖景会有偏差哦。交通：有车的话很方便，否则出行还比较麻烦的。地下车库和安保人员让我觉得很安全。房间：非常舒适，硬件很好，最漂亮的是大厅，在市区的酒店很少可以见到这么有气势和视觉松爽的大厅，很棒。免费早餐要重点说一下，很不错，丰富也很有地方特色，但是如果你睡懒觉起晚的话，一定要进去就把吃的全部拿好，不然你有可能什么都吃不到了。因为服务员很可能不会和你打招呼就收餐了，等你再去取食，发现什么都没有了。本人就严重的感受了一次，当然事后，服务员的热情弥补让我没有投诉。除了这点，其他的都没话说，够得上五星水准。不管怎样，下次依然会选择开元名都。,"Very good external environment, beautiful Yunlong Lake, a strong sense of vacation, making people relax and comfortable.It is just that the lake view house will be stated at the head station, otherwise, the lake view will be deviated.Transportation: It is convenient to have a car, otherwise travel is more troublesome.The underground garage and security personnel make me feel safe.Room: Very comfortable, the hardware is very good, the most beautiful is the lobby. There are very few hotels in the urban hotels. It is great.The free breakfast must be focused on, very good, rich and local characteristics, but if you sleep lazily, you must go in and take all the food, otherwise you may not eat anything.Because the waiter is likely not to say hello to you, wait for you to eat, and find that nothing is.I felt it seriously once. Of course, the enthusiasm of the waiter made me have no complaint.Except for this, there is nothing else to say, it is enough for five -star level.In any case, the Kaiyuan name will still be chosen next time."
1,看了点评后要求入住可看到海景的山景房，前台服务非常周到，住在17层。房间很喜欢，床够大，风景很漂亮，特别是两侧的落地大窗，海景侧正对维多利亚湾，孩子兴奋极了。地点交通很便利，去各个方向都很方便，中环、铜锣湾、尖沙咀、海洋公园等等。上山顶也有15路可直接到（如选择缆车走到车站只需10分钟）。早餐很丰富，服务也相当周到。国语交流没有太大问题。没有前面说的旧的感觉，很满意，以后有机会还会入住。,"After watching the review, you need to stay in the mountain view room where you can see the sea view. The front desk service is very thoughtful and lives on the 17th floor.The room likes it, the bed is big enough, and the scenery is very beautiful, especially the large window on both sides. The sea view is facing Victoria Gulf. The child is very excited.Local traffic is very convenient, and it is convenient to go to all directions. Central, Causeway Bay, Tsim Sha Tsui, Ocean Park, etc.There are 15 routes on the top of the mountain (only 10 minutes to choose a cable car to the station).Breakfast is rich and the service is quite thoughtful.There is no big problem with Mandarin exchanges.Without the old feeling mentioned earlier, I am very satisfied, and I have the opportunity to stay in the future."
1,这次假期就是为了看江南小镇，所以在网上看到这家酒店就订了，感觉特别的好，就是晚上有点怕人，整个大院子被红红的灯光笼罩着，让我想起了[大红灯笼高高挂]，但白天就很好了，人不多，整个院子就是我们娘俩的了，而且房间里的布置也特别有味道，让我家老太太高兴得不得了。以后有机会再来同里，还要住这里。,"This holiday is to see Jiangnan Town, so I booked this hotel on the Internet. It feels particularly good, but it is a bit scared at night.High hanging], but it is very good during the day, there are not many people, the whole yard is from our mother, and the layout in the room is particularly flavorful, which makes my old lady happy.In the future, I have the opportunity to come in the same room and live here."
1,不是所有的房间都有阳台入住记得要问一下向马路的单床间两头的都没有阳台服务很好隔音很差尤其是晚上只要有人在走道说话一清二楚,"Not all rooms have a balcony. Remember to ask if there is no balcony service at the two ends of the single bed at the road on the road, especially at night as long as someone is talking about the aisle at night."
1,酒店总体来说还不错，行政套房比较宽敞明亮，面向大海，房间设施也很新，虽然距离海边肯定不止100米，但也不算太远，步行五六分钟吧，总之硬件不错。服务感觉稍差，尤其是前台，我是要两张大床的套房，出行前打了几次电话确认，都说没问题，可到了房间发现只有一张床，因为我们要住四个人，与前台协商告之所有房间全满了，连标间都没有了，可据我在大堂、餐厅及水疗会所的观察入住率肯定到不了100%，连续三天都去了水疗每次也就两三个人，没办法最后加了两张床，很不舒服。门童不错，开门、拿行李、记出租车牌号。楼层服务员稍差，第二天下午两点回来还没打扫房间。自助餐厅有些贵，88元/人，可吃的东西不多，不过当天三文鱼不限量，但个人感觉还是不值。游泳池水太凉，根本下不去，老公平时游泳都要游2000米，在这儿连50米都没游到就给冻上来了，我怀疑酒店到底想不想让人来游。总之硬件够4星，软件也就3星吧。,"The hotel is generally good. The administrative suite is relatively spacious and bright, facing the sea, and the room facilities are very new. Although it must be more than 100 meters away from the seaside, it is not too far away. Walk for five or six minutes. In short, the hardware is good.The service feels slightly worse, especially the front desk. I want two large beds of beds. I called several times before traveling to confirm. They said that there was no problem. I found that there was only one bed in the room.All the rooms that negotiated the negotiation were full, and even the standard room was gone, but according to my observation and occupancy rate in the lobby, restaurant and spa clubs, it must not reach 100%.There is no way to add two beds in the end, which is very uncomfortable.The door children are good, open the door, take luggage, and remember the taxi plate.The waiter of the floor was slightly worse, and the room did not clean up at two pm the next day.The buffet restaurant is a bit expensive, 88 yuan/person, there are not many things to eat, but the salmon was not limited that day, but the personally felt that it was not worth it.The water of the swimming pool is too cool, and I ca n’t go down at all. The husband usually swims to swim for 2000 meters. Here is a fresher without even you even if you swim 50 meters. I suspect that the hotel wants to make people travel.In short, the hardware is 4 stars, so the software is 3 stars."
1,酒店环境还可，价位也不错，我想以后还是会居住这里。,"The hotel environment is also available, and the price is good. I think I will live here in the future."
1,"距离川沙公路较近,但是公交指示不对,如果是""蔡陆线""的话,会非常麻烦.建议用别的路线.房间较为简单.","It is closer to the Sichuan -Sang Highway, but the buses are wrong. If it is ""Cai Lu Line"", it will be very troublesome. It is recommended to use other routes. The room is simpler."
1,住的特价房，总体不错。个人感觉比梅苑好一些。50元的早餐有些不值，东西做得很一般。其间两件事，不知道问题出在携程还是酒店。1.网上订房的时候，显示还有单人房，但是半个多小时之后携程打电话说没房了。此时我已经在去杭州的路上了。这个时候再调整我就很被动。2.晚上九点入住，十点多了也没见着“免费赠送欢迎水果1份”，电话询问才送来两个桔子和两个又小有脏的苹果（一般酒店要么送切好的果盘，要么送清洗过的水果，不会看起来脏兮兮的就送进房间）。当然这也都是小事，不影响入住。补充点评2007年4月6日：床头柜上25元的依云水。。俺喝了。。似乎放在这个位置上的都是赠送的水。。没想到。。喝完了才发现价格标签。。,"The special room for living is generally good.Personally feel better than Meiyuan.The breakfast of 50 yuan is worthless, and things are very ordinary.In the meantime, I don't know that the problem lies in Ctrip or Hotel.1. During online reservation, there are still single rooms, but Ctrip called more than half an hour to say that there was no house.At this point I was on the way to Hangzhou.At this time, I will be very passive.2. Check in nine o'clock in the evening, and at ten o'clock at ten o'clock, I did not see ""Free Free Fruit Free Fruit"". Two oranges and two small and dirty apples were sent by phone.Either send the washed fruits, and it will not look dirty and send it into the room).Of course, this is also a trivial matter, which does not affect the check -in.Supplementary comment on April 6, 2007: 25 yuan on the bedside table.EssenceI drank.EssenceIt seems that the water is given in this position.Essencedid not expect.EssenceAfter drinking, I found the price label.Essence"
1,地理位置相当好，离海港城走路只需五分钟，酒店房间灯光明亮，液晶电视够大，感觉很舒服。惟独酒店大堂小了点。下次我还是选择这酒店。,"The geographical location is quite good. It takes only five minutes to walk away from Harbor City. The hotel room is bright, the LCD TV is large enough, and it feels very comfortable.The hotel lobby is a little smaller.Next time I still choose this hotel."
1,价格比较低。房间很干净。感觉很不错。当然，整个东北在服务行业方面的意识，与沿海几个大地方还是有些差距。这个宾馆身处长春，能有这样，就不错了。这个宾馆绝对值。下次还会去的。,"The price is relatively low.The room is very clean.It feels very good.Of course, the entire Northeast's consciousness in the service industry is still a gap with several large places along the coast.This hotel is in Changchun, and it is good to have this.This hotel is absolutely valuable.I will go next time."
0,预订时已说明是一家三口人，可旅馆内的设施用品只有两套，要加收费才给第三套，前台的服务员一听说要开发票似乎不太满意，以致结帐花费了20分钟。,"It has been stated that it is a family of three, but there are only two sets of facilities in the hotel. It is necessary to add charge to the third set. The waiter at the front desk seems to be not satisfied when I heard that the invoicing is not satisfied, so it took 20 minutes to check the checkout."
1,"看了各位评论后，通过携程订了一个豪华间。如大家评述,房间装修和摆设洋气、干净、舒服。酒店服务还是非常好的。前台MM没有传说中那么漂亮，也许我去时人家没上班。不过前台的男服务生还是很帅滴。美中不足的是我要的大床房只有临街的了，房间的窗户不是隔音的那种，晚上被窗外的车声吵得半夜一两点钟才睡着。另外，现在3楼和5楼等还在装修，3楼还好，5楼的油漆味很重。建议订房前与酒店电话确认房间位置和装修进展情况再入住。","After reading the comments, I booked a luxury room through Ctrip.For example, everyone commented that the room decoration and furnishings were clean, clean, and comfortable.The hotel service is still very good.The front desk MM is not as beautiful as the legend, maybe people did not go to work when I went.However, the male waiter at the front desk is still very handsome.The disadvantage is that the big bed room I want is only the streets, and the windows of the room are not the kind of sound insulation. At night, the sound of the car outside the window was quarreled at one or two o'clock in the middle of the night before falling asleep.In addition, the third and fifth floors are still renovating. The 3rd floor is okay. The paint on the 5th floor is very heavy.It is recommended to confirm the location and decoration progress of the room before reservation."
1,临时决定到北京出差，很快就定好了，房间不错，住了两个晚上，在这附近这里算是最经济实惠的地方，而质量又是最好的了！,"The temporary decision to go to Beijing for a business trip, it will be settled soon. The room is good. I live for two nights. It is the most economical place nearby, and the quality is the best!"
1,前台楼层服务员都不错，房间安静整洁，交通方便，吃的周围也挺多．唯一不足，卫生间地漏设计不好，导致少量积水．,"The front desk floor waiters are good, the rooms are quiet and neat, and the traffic is convenient.The only insufficiency, the bathroom floor drain is not well designed, resulting in a small amount of water."
1,离机场很近，15分钟，不到20块钱，可是离市区实在太远了，而且中间有段路蛮荒凉旁边有个易初莲花，还有个明珠广场，环境还是不错的，房间也行。携程的价格很没有竞争力，我和朋友同时入住，我的房价是548，朋友通过她公司预定，房价仅为410。,"It is very close to the airport, 15 minutes, less than 20 yuan, but it is too far from the urban area, and there is a section of the road in the middle and there is a lotus lotus, and there is a pearl square. The environment is still good. The room is also in the room.OK.The price of Ctrip is very competitive. My friend and I stay at the same time. My house price is 548. Friends book through her company. The house price is only 410."
1,酒店位置比较偏僻，离东莞候机厅还有40分钟路程。但是酒店设施和环境还不错。房间够大，设施让人感觉舒服。配套餐厅的服务很好，菜的味道不错。不过缺点是通过携程预定的房间总是位置很差。要求无烟楼层说没有。虽然房间安排在7楼但还是能听到4楼夜总会的鬼哭狼嚎至深夜。实在气愤。更有甚者，两次要求服务人员提供擦鞋服务但都没有过来。。。这点感觉很差。。。本来想投诉的但是实在太忙就算了。。。还有要门童叫出租车会明目张胆的把他的20元小费加进去。。。综合来评，离五星级还差一点。补充点评2006年12月10日：看了楼下的点评补充一下，餐厅的菜是贵了点。地址也偏出入没车不方便。适合商务客居住，自己掏腰包的不建议住这里。通过携程定房的一定要在前台力争高层的房间，越高越好。有游泳池，确实很漂亮的，喜欢游泳的不要错过哦。,"The hotel location is relatively remote, and there are 40 minutes away from the Dongguan terminal.But hotel facilities and environment are not bad.The room is large enough, and the facilities feel comfortable.The service of the supporting restaurant is very good, and the dishes have a good taste.But the disadvantage is that the room scheduled by Ctrip is always poor.No smoke floors say no.Although the room was arranged on the 7th floor, the ghost crying wolf on the 4th floor of the nightclub was still late at night.Really angry.What's more, the service personnel are required to provide shoe -wipe services twice but did not come over.EssenceEssenceThis feels bad.EssenceEssenceI wanted to complain, but I was too busy.EssenceEssenceThere is also the child who calls the taxi to add his 20 yuan tip.EssenceEssenceComprehensive evaluation, it is a little worse than the five -star.Supplementary comment on December 10, 2006: After watching the reviews downstairs, adding it, the restaurant's dishes are a bit expensive.The address is also inconvenient.Suitable for business customers to live, it is not recommended to live here.Through the Ctrip's fixed house, we must strive to make high -rise rooms in the front desk, the higher the better.There is a swimming pool, which is really beautiful. Don't miss it if you like swimming."
1,"酒店设备老化,建议考虑更新,酒店电脑网络速度慢,下次不再入会该酒店,宾馆反馈2008年6月12日：酒店非常重视并立即让电脑房工作人员对该客人所住的房间进行网络测试，情况如下：该客房在打开主页时情况较好，但在下载邮件时速度较慢，酒店已联系维护酒店宽带的公司进行了整改。酒店的宽带速度较快且房内上网免费一直以来受到客户的好评，酒店对宽带问题会更加重视，做好维护工作。非常感谢客人对我酒店提出的宝贵意见.","The hotel equipment is aging, it is recommended to consider updating, the hotel's computer network is slow, and the hotel will not be entered next time.

The hotel has contacted the company that maintains the hotel broadband for rectification.The hotel's broadband speed is fast and the Internet access is well received by customers. The hotel will pay more attention to broadband issues and do a good job of maintenance.Thank you very much for the valuable opinions on our hotel."
0,"非常差的酒店!前台竟然把预授权取消做成了一般消费,现在还要通过银行来沟通.结帐的时候,不给看消费清单就要刷卡,还把房间号给搞错.入住用了一小时,退房用了一小时.太可怕了,下次坚决不住了.","Very poor hotel! The front desk has canceled the pre -authorization into general consumption. Now it is necessary to communicate through the bank. When checking out, you have to swipe the card if you do n’t give the consumption list.One hour, it took an hour to check out. It's terrible, and I can't help it next time."
1,入住丽晶，感觉很好。因为是新酒店，的确有淡淡的油漆味，房间内较新。房间大小合适，卫生间设备齐全，服务态度也很好。网速可能是提升了吧，感觉还好。有免费的插线板、水果刀。。。等一系列的日常用品免费提供，很细心。晚上的自助餐是每人68元，菜品一般、就算说的过去吧。酒店外有西贝筱面等几家饭馆。西贝的菜实在是量大的惊人，人多在酒店吃就不如去西贝吃了。酒店21：30-24点有广式晚茶，吃过几次，味道正宗，就是点心品种略少。哈。酒店地处青山区，包头分昆区、青山区。相对来说：昆区是最繁华的，青山区次之。像包百等大商场全在昆区，从酒店打车到包百商圈车费12元多。青山区也有一个王府井百货，相对来说比包百商圈的略小，从酒店打车8元多。银河广场离酒店有一段距离，打车9、10元吧，银河广场边上有“科丽珑”24小时营业的超市。酒店一楼有小卖部，周围基本没有超市。这次住正赶上有几家公司在这里开会，有时楼道里略吵，晚上还有几次有人敲错门，理论上与酒店管理没关系吧。希望以后还是尽量让会议团体住在一层，也许这样可以好些吧。总体感觉丽晶很好，以后来包头还会住这里。,"Check in Lijing, it feels good.Because it is a new hotel, it does have a light paint, and the room is relatively new.The room is suitable, the bathroom equipment is complete, and the service attitude is also very good.The network speed may be improved, it feels okay.There are free plug -in boards and fruit knives.EssenceEssenceWait for a series of daily supplies to provide free of charge, very careful.The buffet at night is 68 yuan per person. The dishes are average, even if you say it.There are several restaurants and other restaurants outside the hotel.Sibei's dishes are really amazing. It is better to eat in the hotel to eat.The hotel 21: 30-24 has Cantonese-style night tea. After eating several times, the taste is authentic, which is slightly less species.ha.The hotel is located in Qingshan District, and Baotou is divided into Kun District and Qingshan District.Relatively speaking: Kun District is the most prosperous, Qingshan District is the second.Large shopping malls such as Baobai are all in Kun District, from hotel taxis to Baibai commercial charges of more than 12 yuan.There is also a Wangfujing Department Store in Qingshan District, which is relatively smaller than the Baibai Shang District, and it is more than 8 yuan from the hotel.Galaxy Plaza is a distance from the hotel. Take 9 or 10 yuan for a taxi. There is a 24 -hour supermarket on the side of Galaxy Plaza.There is a small sales department on the first floor of the hotel, and there are basically no supermarkets around.This time, I was caught up with a few companies to meet here. Sometimes there were a little noisy in the corridor. There were several people knocked on the wrong door at night. Theoretically, it had nothing to do with hotel management.I hope that in the future, try to let the meeting group live on the first floor, maybe this can be better.Overall feels that Li Jing is very good, and then Baotou will live here."
1,虽说是4星，但服务绝对是5星的。从进入酒店就有人问候，入住和退房的速度都很快。房间的布置和设施也很让人满意，一进去就有舒适的感觉。住了很多次，每次选酒店都会选它。对于在开发区办事的人，绝对是首选。,"Although it is 4 stars, the service is definitely 5 stars.There are people greeting from entering the hotel, and the speed of staying and checking out is very fast.The layout and facilities of the room are also very satisfactory, and they feel comfortable as soon as they enter.I stayed many times, and I chose it every time I choose a hotel.For those who work in the development zone, it is definitely the first choice."
1,房间状况不错，较大，也很卫生。但是服务人员服务水平还需要进一步提高。下次还会选择。,"The room is in good condition, large, and very hygienic.However, the service level needs to be further improved.I will choose next time."
1,在上海这个价位住这样的酒店算很不错的了，我住的是标准间，房间是属于很宽敞的那种，卫生状况也不错，出门左转不远的路口有家南翔小笼很不错，可以解决早餐、午餐或晚餐，出门直走大约15分钟就到静安寺了，很方便。,"It is very good to live in such a hotel at this price in Shanghai. I live in a standard room. The room is a very spacious one. The hygiene is also good.You can solve breakfast, lunch or dinner, and go straight for about 15 minutes to Jing'an Temple, which is very convenient."
1,"酒店离市中心虽然远,但门口就是地铁站,对与没车或不喜欢坐出租车的朋友来说是个好地方.酒店房间设施不错,我定的是大床房,感觉很舒服.","Although the hotel is far from the city center, there is a subway station at the door. It is a good place for friends who have no cars or do not like to take a taxi. The hotel room facilities are good. I set a large bed room and feel very comfortable."
0,风格就是快捷酒店，不过服务和得到的优秀酒店称号相差好远，我住的是商务大床房，是最靠走廊尽头的单人间，房间异味很浓，灰色的沙发很脏，有好几个破洞，房内的网线是铁通的，但“铁定不通”周围没有商店，以后不会再住了。,"The style is the fast hotel, but the title of the excellent hotel and the excellent hotels are very far away. I live in a large business bed room. It is the single room at the end of the corridor. The room is strong. The gray sofa is dirty.In the cave, the network cable in the room is Tietong, but there are no shops around the ""ironing"" and will not live anymore in the future."
0,某些酒店人员对待顾客不诚恳。说给你换房间，骗你说是价钱贵的房间。其实是把你的房间档次调低了。没有房间就实话实说，别骗人啊，什么态度。有些房间的隐私性也不好,"Some hotel staff treat customers in dishonesty.Said to change your room and lie to you that it is a expensive room.In fact, the grade of your room has been lowered.To be honest without a room, don't lie, what attitude.Some rooms are not privacy"
0,房间和卫生间连在一起，晚上睡觉总是有心理阴影。即使最贵的房间也一样。水床房起码格个屏风呀。大床房就更一塌糊涂了，像在鸡笼里一样。房间和卫生间格一下成本很高吗？,"The room and the bathroom are connected together, and sleeping at night always has a psychological shadow.Even the most expensive room is the same.The sewing room is at least a screen.The big bed room is even more messy, as if in a chicken cage.Is the cost of rooms and bathrooms high?"
1,7月13日入住A区三楼豪华房间，景观不错能看到湖景，房间设施一般（可能是期待值有点高），卫生间倒是奇大，有点意外，床太软不太适应。走道里的制冰机不错，有点度假酒店的风格。酒店的外景类似三亚喜来登的风格，室内外的游泳池都很不错，很干净。早餐还是不错的，就是品种多点就更好。由于第二天是换到天清岛入住，感觉开元比天清岛强太多了，相比之下这里若是五星的话，天清岛只能算三星。,"On July 13, staying in the luxurious room on the third floor of Area A. The lake was good to see the lake view. The room facilities were average (maybe the expectation value was a bit high).The ice making machine in the aisle is good, a bit of a holiday hotel style.The hotel's location is similar to the style of Sanya Xilaiden. The indoor and outdoor swimming pools are very good and clean.Breakfast is still good, that is, there are more varieties.Because the next day was changed to Tianqing Island, I felt that Kaiyuan was much stronger than Tianqing Island. In contrast, if the five -star here, Tianqing Island can only be regarded as Samsung."
1,很不错的一家5星级酒店。房间也很干净，就是电视太小，而且离床比较远，看不太清楚。服务人员态度也很好。下次一定会再住。,"Very good 5 -star hotel.The room is also very clean, that is, the TV is too small, and the bed is far away, and it is not clear.The attitude of the service staff is also very good.I will live again next time."
1,"3月19日入住,共两晚.现在才上来做下点评,呵呵.1,定的是双人床大房,虽然是比较年头多的宾馆,但是整洁程度和环境还算不错了!2,服务人员比较热情,由于自己的充电器宾馆内使用不了.所以半夜的时候要求前台送个旅行充电器过来.但是前三个都不好用,服务生上上下下的跑了四五次!但没有一点厌烦!最后还一再向我表示歉意!很棒!!!3,餐饮方面西餐厅感觉还不错!价格和味道方面还算不错!至于中餐厅感觉一般!菜品没有特色,而且还比较贵!自己一个人一顿饭花了400左右,还没吃饱!4,整体的环境很不错!后面的绿化做的不错,有种幽深雅静的感觉!呵呵","Check in on March 19, two nights for two nights. Now I come up to make a review, haha .1, it is a double bed room. Although it is a hotel with a relatively many years, the degree of cleanliness and the environment is pretty good! 2, service serviceThe personnel are more enthusiastic, because they can't use their own charger hotels. Therefore, it is required to send a travel charger to the front desk in the middle of the night. But the first three are not easy to use, the waiter ran four or five times up and down!A little bored! Finally, I apologized to me again and again! Very great !!! 3, the western restaurant in the catering feels good! The price and taste are pretty good! As for the Chinese restaurant, the dishes are not unique, and it is more expensive!A person spent about 400 meals, not enough to eat! 4, the overall environment is very good! The later greening is good, there is a deep and elegant feeling! Haha"
1,"门童好像不错,其他不记得了晚上睡得还可以","Men -child seems to be pretty good, I don’t remember that I slept at night"
1,大年初一住了一晚，订的480的房间，相当相当不错。唯一的缺点，因为住的人少，显得有点冷清，但餐厅服务很好，没吃到自助餐，但点菜也很不错的，性价比很好(夫人是山西人，她说所有菜做得都没家里的好。那是当然的了)。宾馆就是个大公园，感觉非常好，但估计只适合开车去的朋友。打车去会很不方便，离市区也很远。美中不足的是离开的时候正好停电，前台居然就不能办checkout，可见员工应变能力较差。当时有一个应该是经理的在场，问了一下情况就让前台按客人自述退房(同时还有一家，都已经说明自己在餐厅有消费，没有其他消费)，但前台还是不给办，硬是等来电了才办理，多等了十五分钟。不爽!!服务给四星。,"I lived one night on the first day of the New Year, and the 480 rooms I ordered were quite good.The only disadvantage is that because there are few people who live in, they seem a bit deserted, but the restaurant service is very good. I do n’t have a buffet, but the order is also very good.Good at home. That is of course).The hotel is a large park and feels very good, but it is estimated that it is only suitable for friends who drive.It will be inconvenient to take a taxi, and it is far from the urban area.The disadvantage is that the power outage was stopped when leaving, and the front desk could not do Checkout. It can be seen that employees have poor response ability.At that time, one should be the manager's present. Asked the situation, let the front desk check out by the guest's self -report (at the same time, there is one, it has stated that he has consumption in the restaurant and has no other consumption), but the front desk is not given.After calling, you can do it for fifteen minutes.Unhappy !! Serve four stars."
1,行政房确实不错，服务好，房间也舒服这个价位真,"The administrative house is really good, the service is good, and the room is comfortable at this price."
0,非常一般的酒店，完全不够4星的级别，到了才发现酒店外观和照片相差很远，不是很大。大堂很土，房间很冷，那天正好赶上下雨，入住的时候窗帘上拉上的，睡到半夜被冻醒了，早上起来才发现，原来窗户是开着的，为什么服务员不把窗户关上呢，也许是我太粗心了。洗澡的地方也不好，淋浴房很小，都伸展不开。床上的用品也很差，被子也薄。楼上的餐厅超贵，一个西红柿炒蛋要28还是38，刀磨的是相当的快呀！下次不会住了，太差了！,"Very ordinary hotels are not enough for 4 stars. When I arrived at it, I found that the appearance of the hotel is very different from the photos, not very large.The lobby is very earthy, and the room is very cold. That day just happened to catch up with the rain. When the curtains were pulled up, I was frozen in the middle of the night and found that the window was opened in the morning. Why did the waiter turn the window?Maybe I'm too careless.The place to take a bath is not good. The shower room is very small and cannot be opened.The supplies on the bed are also poor and the quilt is thin.The restaurant upstairs is super expensive. A tomato scrambled egg is 28 or 38. The knife is quite fast!I won't live next time, it's too bad!"
1,"普通标准间的房门都太次了,包括卫生间的门,而且钥匙卡很不好用!还不如就住经济间呢!早餐还不错!","The door of the ordinary standard room is too much, including the door of the bathroom, and the key card is not easy to use! It is better to live in the economy room! Breakfast is not bad!"
0,难以相信这是携程重点推荐的3星级宾馆！单人房住了5天，价格240元/晚，期间得知中石化试题题库会议，房价160元/天。房间的地毯已经N干年没有清洗除尘了，看上去黑乎乎的，各种斑点、污迹、小洞眼令人很不舒服。（过道里的地毯略微好一点）第一晚安排在二楼，后来调整到5楼，隔音不好，隔壁客人晚上2点回房间，关门、电视声音很大。卫生间有玻璃窗，但是不能打开，塑料窗帘小于窗户的面积，因此女士要小心露光。我住的那间，下水道不畅。每次积水都要没过脚面，非常sick！餐厅是外包的，一份（例盘）尖椒牛柳30多元，一个鱼香肉丝20元，可能只有这儿的价格离3星级标准接近一点。5天的自助早餐几乎都是一份汤面加1-2个煎蛋，因为几乎没有什么合口味的东东可供选择。因为开会，基本早出晚归，最后一天离店时才发现，一直垫着的床单竟然有数个脚印在其上！前台服务员有的和善，有的冷若冰霜，不可一概而论。,"It is difficult to believe that this is a 3 -star hotel recommended by Ctrip!The single room lived for 5 days and the price was 240 yuan/night.The carpet in the room has not been cleaned and dust -dusting for N years. It looks dark. Various spots, stains, and small holes are very uncomfortable.(The carpet in the aisle is a little bit better.) The first night was arranged on the second floor, and then adjusted to the 5th floor. The sound insulation was not good. The guests next door returned to the room at 2 pm. The door closed and the TV sound was loud.There are glass windows in the bathroom, but it cannot be opened. The plastic curtain is less than the area of the window. Therefore, the lady should be careful.The one I lived was not smooth.There is no foot surface every time, very sick!The restaurant is outsourced. A (example) pepper beef willow will be more than 30 yuan, and a fish flavor shredded is 20 yuan. It may only be close to the 3 -star standard here.Five days of buffet breakfast is almost a soup noodle with 1-2 fried eggs, because there is almost no taste to choose from.Because of the meeting, I basically went out early and returned late. When I left the store on the last day, I found that the sheets that had been clicked on the sheets had several footprints on it!Some waiters at the front desk are good, and some are cold and frosty, which cannot be generalized."
1,"房间很好，符合五星级的标准。酒店离沟口及边边街都比较近，是去九寨沟旅游的最佳选择。补充点评2008年7月21日：地震对该酒店没有任何影响。宾馆反馈2008年7月24日：谢谢您的点评,欢迎下次下榻我酒店!我们将为您提供更周到的服务及优质的产品.","The room is very good and meets the five -star standard.The hotel is closer to the trench mouth and the edge of the street.

1,房间还算可以，就是旧了些。早餐没有酸奶，有些美中不足。,"The room is okay, it is older.There is no yogurt for breakfast, and some are inadequate."
1,"房间还算可以,只是价格性价比还需要努力,688元这个价格在郑州可以住其他宾馆了.","The room is okay, but the price is cost -effective. The price of 688 yuan can stay in other hotels in Zhengzhou."
0,价格还可以，位置也不错，就是房间装修太旧了，也不干净，还有异味！,"The price is okay, the location is also good, that is, the room decoration is too old, it is not clean, and there is odor!"
1,硬件和软件均非常不错，下次去成都考虑入住。,"Both the hardware and software are very good, and go to Chengdu to take care of it next time."
0,三星级酒店，190的房价（在岳阳应该算高了），酒店在做促销158有就有房间了问了前台和我订的有什么不一样，回答是促销的比较旧，订的是新装修的没有感觉比较新啊～家具比较旧，很多地方掉漆了。挂衣服的地方一层灰尘浴缸里面有三个补丁，其中有一个大于我的拇指电吹风不能用其他的就没有什么了前台服务还是不错的就是房间不怎么样感觉对不起房价～,"Three -star hotel, the house price of 190 (should be high in Yueyang), the hotel is doing the promotion 158. There is a room and asked what the front desk is different from me. The answer is the older promotion.The decoration does not feel relatively new ~ The furniture is older, and the paint is dropped in many places.There are three patchs in the dusty bathtub where the clothes hanging. One of them is more than my thumb hair. If the other is not else, there is nothing. The front desk service is good or the room is not very sorry for house prices ~"
0,前台服务极差：订的是观景房。但第一天入住时，前台人员坚持说我订的是套间，要打电话给携程去确认，才说我订的是观景房。退房时又发现前台人员私自改动我当时确认的房价，将房价由当初确认的558改成588，而且这个过程从未和我确认过。更可笑的是，前台收款的小姐连水单也没打给我确认，就去刷我的卡。怀疑是不是黑店。客房服务极并：原本想睡个懒觉，早上9点钟在睡梦中被电话吵醒，问我几点起床说要来打扫啊。我说还没睡醒，居然被追问一个小时后能不能醒？有毛病啊房间：据说是岛上最好的酒店，但房间又旧又小。还不如三星的酒店。,"The front desk service is very poor: the viewing room is booked.However, when I was in the first day, the front desk staff insisted that I ordered the suit. I had to call Ctrip to confirm, so I said that I ordered the viewing room.When I got out of the room, I found that the front desk personnel changed the house prices I confirmed privately at the time, and changed house prices from 558 that I was originally confirmed to 588, and this process has never been confirmed with me.What's even more ridiculous is that the lady who received the payment at the front desk did not call me to confirm, so she went to swipe my card.Suspected whether it is a black shop.The guest room service was very integrated: originally wanted to sleep, and was awakened by the phone at 9 o'clock in the morning, and asked me when I got up and said that I would come to clean it.I said that before I woke up, I was asked if I could wake up after an hour?There is something wrong with the room: It is said to be the best hotel on the island, but the room is old and small.Not as good as Samsung's hotel."
1,"酒店大门正对一个十字路口,还算比较好找.大厅中规中矩,大床房内部装修和服务都感觉一般.晚上会有电话骚扰,如果要赶虹桥机场的航班,此酒店还算不错的.","The door of the hotel is facing a crossroad, which is better to find. The hall is quite satisfactory. The interior decoration and services of the large bed room feel average. There will be phone harassment at night. If you want to catch a flight at Hongqiao Airport, this hotel is pretty good."
0,在这酒店住让我此次旅行非常不愉快。酒店在一片黑漆漆烂尾楼的小区内，非常偏僻，出租车司机根本不知道，离海滩有几公里远，要步行5分钟才能走到公路边上打车，虽然酒店有叫车服务，但是叫的是私家车，上车前谈好价钱才敢坐。房间设施还不错，但是房间比较小，也许别的房间会好点吧，楼顶有个观光台，风景还可以，但有很多碍眼的烂尾楼。令我气愤的是，第二天早是11点20退房，退房的是一个瘦瘦的女生。入住时房价160元，押金300，应该找回140元，服务员在前台折腾了好一阵子，说前台没有零钱，让我给他60元找我200，我没多想，就给了她60元。她退钱给我的时候，我的车来了，没有仔细看，后来发现，上面一张是真的，下面一张是假币。这让我非常气愤，想必这是有预谋的行为。事后第二天我打电话到公司经理处投诉，一位女性经理要了我的电话并告知会给我答复。十天已过，毫无音训，一怒之下我决定公开此事，给大家一个忠告。,"Living in this hotel made me very unhappy this trip.The hotel is very remote in the neighborhood of a dark paint tail building. The taxi driver does not know at all. It is a few kilometers away from the beach. It takes 5 minutes to walk to the side of the road to take a taxi.It is called a private car. When you get in the car, talk about the price before you dare to sit.The room facilities are not bad, but the room is relatively small. Maybe there will be better rooms. There is a tourist platform on the top of the building. The scenery is okay, but there are many obstacles.What made me angry is that the next day was at 11:20, and a thin girl was checking out.The house price was 160 yuan and the deposit was 300 yuan. It should be retrieved for 140 yuan. The waiter tossed on the front desk for a while and said that there was no change in the front desk. Let me give him 60 yuan to find me 200. I didn't think much, so I gave her 60 yuan 60 yuanEssenceWhen she refunded the money to me, my car came and didn't look at it carefully. Later, I found that the above one was true, and the following one was counterfeit currency.This makes me very angry, presumably this is a premeditated behavior.I called the company manager to complain the next day afterwards. A female manager asked me to call and inform me that it would reply to me.Ten days have passed, no sound training, I decided to disclose the matter and give you a advice."
1,酒店整体环境那是没得说，除了房间不太隔音。哈哈，我隔壁很热闹哦！,"The overall environment of the hotel has to be said, except for the room's not sound insulation.Haha, I'm very lively next door!"
1,通过携程报的自由行带小孩去香港。住过旺角的朗豪，因为还是喜欢尖沙咀所以最后选择朗庭。酒店大堂不错，不知道为什么那么多人嫌小。很幸运被升级，当时订了两个房间可是另外一个没有好。前台小姐送我们每个房间100元的免税店抵价券，竟然带我们一直到房间，让我受宠若惊。房间刚装修好，橡木地板，在内地酒店不多见。我的窗口还可以看见一点海景。后来看到桌上的通知才知道楼上在装修。可是我们白天出去，也没感觉。那几天天很凉快，比起上海的37度真是意外。孩子去过两次美国的迪斯尼，所以我们只这里的缆车和海景，是最棒的！最后一天还和酒店说好晚点退房。小朋友去了半日游回来还可以游个泳洗个澡再走。3天的行程很累，但酒店的床很舒适，晚上睡得很好。,"Bring children to Hong Kong through the Ctrip.Langhao, who lives in Mong Kok, still chooses Langting because he still likes Tsim Sha Tsui.The hotel lobby is good, I don't know why so many people are too small.Fortunately, I was upgraded. At that time, two rooms were booked, but the other was not good.The front desk lady gave us a tax -free coupon for 100 yuan in each room, and took us to the room, which made me be flattered.The room has just been renovated. Oak flooring is rare in mainland hotels.I can see a little sea view in my window.Later, I saw the notification on the table and knew that upstairs was renovating.But we went out during the day and didn't feel it.It was very cool in those days, and it was really surprising compared to 37 degrees in Shanghai.The child has been to Disney twice in the United States, so we only the cable car and sea view here are the best!On the last day, I told the hotel to check out later.Children can go back for a half -day trip and take a bath and take a bath.The 3 -day trip was tiring, but the hotel's bed was very comfortable and slept well at night."
1,"该酒店的设计理念是让住客感受农村的田园风味,沿水而建的别墅只是大,手工如同农民的村屋一样粗糙,不能细看,会影响心情.这次我们四个男人订的是独享双间别墅,实为三间房间,其中两间为大床,另一间为孩子房,与携程上提供的""大/双""有出入,酒店说已向携程反映床位问题,但这样酒店还是为我们换了间5房的别墅,只开两间房.别墅内有车库、厨房、冰箱、带烘干功能的洗衣机等，一应俱全，若房价平宜点，我会自驾车再住上几天的。","The design concept of the hotel is to let the residents feel the rural pastoral flavor. The villa built along the water is only large. The handicraft is as rough as the farmer's village house.Enjoying the two villas, it is really three rooms. Two of them are large beds, and the other is a child room. It is different from the ""big/double"" provided by Ctrip. The hotel saidThe hotel still changed the 5 -bedroom villa for us, only two rooms. There are garage, kitchen, refrigerator, washing machine with drying function in the villa.Live for a few days."
1,去苏州工作的时候，住过很多酒店。综合比较来看，这家酒店还是比较舒服的。地理位置很方便，即使去新区也很近。出门的时候，酒店的服务员会帮忙叫出租车。虽然房间有点小，但是布置的很温馨舒适，很适合一个人出差时入住，床具也很舒服，可以保证休息。唯一不足的是，预定的时候不能知道房间是在主楼还是附楼。宾馆反馈2008年5月9日：多谢您提出的宝贵意见。一般情况下，携程预订的标房我们是安排在东楼的，因为东楼是06年新开的，房间设施设备均比较新，豪华房我们是安排在主楼的。如您在预订时想知道安排哪栋楼，可以在订单上提出，我们在回复确认预订时会为您注明的。期待您的再次光临。,"When I went to work in Suzhou, I lived in many hotels.In summary, this hotel is still more comfortable.The geographical location is very convenient, and it is very close to the new district.When you go out, the hotel's waiter will help call a taxi.Although the room is a bit small, the layout is very warm and comfortable. It is very suitable for a person to stay in a business trip. The bedding is also very comfortable and can guarantee rest.The only disadvantage is that when you are booked, you cannot know whether the room is in the main building or an attached building.Hotel feedback on May 9, 2008: Thank you for your precious opinions.Under normal circumstances, the standard room booked by Ctrip is arranged in Donglou, because the Donglou was newly opened in 2006, and the room facilities and equipment were relatively new. We arranged for luxury rooms in the main building.If you want to know which building is arranged when booking, you can propose it on the order, and we will indicate you when you reply to confirm the booking.welcome next time."
0,"本来在定单上清楚注明要有电脑可上网的套房,结果入住时酒说没有一间套房但是不能上网.之后给调到了普通套房,感觉很差劲.房间卫生很差,竟然没有换床品,,有黑印和黄斑,服务员解释说换了是洗不掉,简直让人难以理解.毛巾也黑乎乎的,一直没敢用,厕所有很浓的味道.","Originally, it was clearly stated on the order to have a suite that had to access the Internet. As a result, the wine said that there was no suite but could not access the Internet. After that, I was transferred to ordinary suite. It felt bad.There are black marks and macular, the waiter explained that it can't be washed away, it is difficult to understand. The towel is also dark. I have never dared to use it. The toilet is very strong."
0,如果这个酒店也能评上四星的话，那么郑州将有n多n多酒店可以评上四星：1，整个酒店弥漫着油烟味，问是怎么回事，说不清2，房间面积和形状非常差，看他们酒店建筑的外观就能看的出来，斜的3，除了交通便捷之外，实在说不出有什么好的地方了，旁边没有像样的餐厅，酒店里的菜难吃的很，早点特别差，根本就不像一个四星级酒店的早餐标准4，前台服务员态度恶劣，并且人品不好，我因为来不及在携程先预订，直接进酒店入住，问什么价格（我事先知道携程给的是310），前台小姐居然秉承着能宰就宰我的态度，说标间450，我说怎么会了，不可能，我在网上看也就310啊，她说310不可能的，我说那你问问你们经理，能给我多少，她不理我，我快气死了跟她理论了半天觉得没意思，到一边坐着去了，后来实在是不想再折腾出租车找酒店，又跑去问那个前台，她说360，我们经理说了最低价，我再次被激怒，打开电脑，开了携程，亲自给她看携程给的报价，她才不说话了！！我立刻在携程定好，等待订单下来，才310住了进去；5，由此可以看出什么了，首先没有服务意识，其次管理不规范，能宰就宰，一个四星酒店连前台是这样子的素质，还指望什么6，我实在是工作太忙，懒得折腾换酒店，这家酒店的硬件除了大堂像个样之外（很像很多河南地方的作风，家里的门面做的很漂亮，一进去哎呀妈呀），客房，电梯，过道，餐厅，非常差，卫生间就一招待所标准，根本够不上四星！！7，建议以后要入住的朋友们，不要被四星迷惑，郑州没多少家好的酒店，唯一感觉不错的是大河锦江和粤海，哎，我是再也不会来这家了，我真的被气死了,"If this hotel can also comment on four stars, then Zhengzhou will have more than N more hotels to comment on four stars: 1. The entire hotel is filled with the smell of oil fume.Very bad, look at the appearance of their hotel building, you can see it. The oblique 3, except for the convenient transportation, can not say that there are any good places. There is no decent restaurant next to it. The food in the hotel is very difficult to eat., Early particularly bad, it is not like the breakfast standard of a four -star hotel at all. The front desk waiter is bad and the character is not good. Because I have no time to book it at Ctrip, I go to the hotel directly and ask what the price (I know in advance (I know in advanceCtrip gave 310), Miss front desk lady actually adhered to the attitude of being able to slaughter me, saying that the standard room 450, how can I say it, it is impossible, I will see 310 on the Internet. She said 310 is impossible.I said, then you ask your manager how much can you give me, she ignores me, I was almost angry, I felt boring for a long time, and I sat on the side. Later, I really don’t want to toss the taxi to find a hotel.I ran to ask the front desk again. She said 360. Our manager said the lowest price. I was furious again, turned on the computer, opened the Ctrip, and personally showed her the quotation given by Ctrip, so she didn't speak!IntersectionI immediately settled in Ctrip and waited for the order that only 310 lived in; 5, so I can see what, first there is no service awareness, secondThe quality of the quality, what else is there of 6. I am too busy at work and too lazy to toss the hotel. The hardware of this hotel is except for the lobby (very much like a lot of style in Henan.Oh, hey), guest rooms, elevators, aisles, restaurants, very poor, the bathroom is the standard for the hospitality, it is not enough to be four stars!Intersection7. Friends who are advised to stay in the future should not be confused by the four stars. There are not many good hotels in Zhengzhou. The only thing that feels good is the Dahe Jinjiang and Yuehai.I was furious"
1,去了很多次了，管理依然一般，硬件虽好也开始陈旧了，最大的优势就是价格，可别丢了,"After many times, the management is still average. Although the hardware is good, the biggest advantage is the price, but don't lose it, don't lose it"
1,很不错的感觉，不过只住了一天。很有品位。,"It feels good, but only stayed for a day.Very tasteful."

1,最近去福建较多，每次都是住曼哈顿建联大酒店，因为第一次住的感觉很好，我住的是商务房，房间虽然不大，但物品齐全，而且床上的公仔让人有家的感觉，服务也好，,"Recently, I went to Fujian more. Every time I stayed in the Grand Hotel in Manhattan, because I felt very good for the first time. I lived in a business house. Although the room was not large, the items were complete, and the doll on the bed made people have people.The feeling of the home, the service, the service,"
1,室内环境，服务态度都还不错，但就是价格在成都的商务公寓来说是偏高的，还有名气不够，是在一个小区里，出门玩了，找不到怎么回去，呵呵！~,"The indoor environment and the service attitude are not bad, but the business apartment in Chengdu is high, and there is not enough fame. It is in a community. When you go out, you ca n’t find how to go back, haha!~"
0,房价比较贵！楼很高，大堂比较宽敞，房间也够大。但是硬件设施也就是八十年代末，九十年代初的水平，显得老旧，家具起皮，洁具是老一代科勒排队，但已没有了光泽，洗手盆的下水口里卡者牙膏盖子。卫生条件绝对没有四星级，新换的床单上还有不知谁的体毛！电梯里的地毯好像已经洗不出来原色了，房间里也别想找到一尘不染的感觉。服务也不够四星级，门卫冷漠地看着我提着行李来，拖着行李走，估计不叫到头上估计不会主动帮忙。客房服务也不敢恭维，我半夜三点钟才入住的，结果纲要睡下服务员就来敲门，给我送水和一次性用品。精神可嘉！但时间不对。房间里有宽带插头，但不知为什么用不了。地点还算可以。我后来想通了，估计是石油人兴建的，以公款消费为主，所以价格贵、服务差，不重视酒店的管理。要是自己旅行还是少住！,"House prices are more expensive!The building is very high, the lobby is relatively spacious, and the room is large enough.However, the hardware facilities, the end of the 1980s, the level of the early 1990s, look old, furniture peeling, and the cleaning tools are lined up with the old generation of Kohler, but there is no gloss.There is absolutely no four -star level in sanitary conditions, and there are no body hair on the newly replaced sheets!The carpet in the elevator seems to be unable to wash the original color, and don't want to find a sense of dust in the room.The service was not enough for a four -star level. The gatekeeper looked at me indifferently and dragged his luggage. It is estimated that it would not be able to take the initiative to help.The guest room service did not dare to compliment. I only stayed at three o'clock in the middle of the night. As a result, the waiter fell asleep and knocked on the door to send me water and disposable supplies.Style!But time is wrong.There are broadband plugs in the room, but I don't know why it can't be used.The location is okay.I later figured it out. It is estimated that it was built by oil people. It mainly consumes public funds. Therefore, the price is expensive and the service is poor.If you travel yourself, you still live less!"

1,4大2小去的，饭店总的来说还不错，吃的有点贵，没吃，离镇上远了点，进出多是打的，到镇上5-10块不等。住的房间抬头见山，相比镇上，比较幽静，有得有失吧，服务态度还不错吧。,"4 big 2 are small, the restaurant is always pretty good, it is a bit expensive, not eating, it is a little far away from the town, mostly in and out of the town.The room where I live in the mountains.

0,入住了，马上到“十一”了，千万不要入住这家酒店！尤其是自家车的朋友们！我的车停在他们的地下车场，被划得是面目全非！到现在酒店都没有给一个说法。说停车场归物业管，停车除了问题找物业公司。房间调了三次才达到预定的标准！说是五星级，其实都是在装修，我看是目标五星级。,"Stay, go to ""Eleven"" right away, don't stay in this hotel!Especially friends of their own car!My car was parked in their underground parking lots, and it was all beyond recognition!Until now, the hotel has not given a saying.It is said that the parking lot is returned to the property management.The room has been adjusted three times to meet the scheduled standard!It is a five -star level, which is actually decorating. I think the target five -star level."
0,入住感想如下、供参考。1、离机场很近、无车接送、走路约八分钟。夜晚、雨天走路艰难。2、谈不上服务、一切自助。3、房间内的浴巾很旧、无清洁感觉。4、室内游泳池可能从未开放过、大呼上当。5、一楼餐厅的料理味道还可以。6、如果可能、建议最好不住。,"The feelings of staying are as follows, for reference.1. It is very close to the airport, no car pick -up, walking for about eight minutes.It is difficult to walk at night and rainy days.2. Can't talk about service, all self -service.3.

1,"免费升级到豪华大床房。卫生间与房间用透明大玻璃隔开，内加卷帘，比较有特色，居然想到自己的新买的房子也可以参考这个方式，也节省装修费。床垫是宁波产梦神的，非常舒服，(有些评价说太软)，可能我睡惯了软床。总体来说，除了房间稍微小些，修地铁稍微有些噪音,都比较满意。完全不像某些评价那么差","Free upgrade to luxury large bed rooms for free.The bathroom and the room are separated by transparent glass, and rolling curtains are more distinctive. In fact, you can refer to this method when you think of your newly bought house, and also saves decoration costs.The mattress is made of a dream god in Ningbo, which is very comfortable.

They felt very atmospheric and liked this hotel.The room is also very spacious, and the service staff is very enthusiastic and polite. It is a well -managed hotel."
0,便宜，总体还行。延迟了1小时也没收额外的房费，这点不错。东楼的一楼房间很潮啊，味道很难闻，要预定千万不要订一层。房间毛巾很旧很糙，建议赶紧换了！我跑到附近大超市现买的毛巾用。还有地毯真的不如换成木质地板或者直接大理石，那颜色和脏度真的很不舒服。还有就是墙面很脏、鼻涕之类的到处是，还好离得床比较远。二楼房间安静倒是不错。下次再去就换个分店试试，95元的房间真的没法评价什么。补充点评2008年6月20日：忘记说了：周边很方便，大型超市、永和豆浆、机场巴士、药店、美容美发很多。比较热闹！,"Cheap, overall.This is good for a one -hour delay. This is good.The room on the first floor of the East Tower is very tide, and the taste is difficult to smell. Do not book a floor.The room towel is very old and rough, it is recommended to change it!I ran to the nearby supermarket to buy towels.And the carpet is really better to replace it with a wooden floor or a direct marble, the color and dirt are really uncomfortable.There is also a dirty wall, snoting and the like, but fortunately the bed is far away.The room on the second floor is quiet.Go to a branch next time and try it. The room of 95 yuan really can't evaluate anything.Supplementary comment on June 20, 2008: I forgot to say: It is convenient to say: there are many supermarkets, Yonghe soymilk, airport buses, pharmacies, and beauty hairdressers.More lively!"
1,我们一家三口于2008年7月19日至22日，入住泛海名人酒店，之前也看过网上的评论。抱着试试看的心态和本身从事航空服务的、较专业的眼光，真切地体会到物有所值、名不虚传。无论是明亮的大堂、楼层的过厅、还是洁净的客房，都布置地特别典雅舒适，充满着家的温馨。我们住的是位于四楼的海景房，真是面对大海春暖花开，窗台上装饰着漂亮的花花草草，放眼望去是一望无际的大海。栈桥近在咫尺，推开窗户，迎面吹来和煦的海风；关上窗户，没有一丝都市的喧闹。让我们真正感到来到了青岛，真正的享受到海景房的惬意舒适。特别是泛海名人的大堂经理，一个个子高高、眼睛大大的女孩，有点象青春版的倪萍，但比年青时的倪萍更漂亮。态度特别和蔼，为客人服务特别周到，能真正的想客人所想、急客人所急。特别主动地关注客人的需求，及时了解和为客人解决困难。她总是面带微笑，举手投足和言语间特别礼貌周到、规范专业。即使外面只是有些蒙蒙细雨，她也能特别周到的、主动为客人送上雨伞。我觉得她可以做青岛的形象大使，她的美丽端庄，特别有中国传统女性的风采和气韵。再去青岛，还住泛海名人，也希望更多的朋友认识这位优秀的、漂亮大方、有东方女性特质的大堂经理。感谢泛海名人带给我们一个美好假期，也谢谢这位大堂经理及楼层服务员的优质服务。来自北京的客人2008/08/01,"The family of three of our family stayed at the Celebrity Hotel of the Oceanic Sea from July 19th to 22nd, 2008, and I also saw online comments before.With the mentality of trying and seeing aviation services, he has realized that it is worthwhile and well -known.Whether it is a bright lobby, the hall on the floor, or the clean room, the land is particularly elegant and comfortable, full of warmth of the family.We live in the sea view room on the fourth floor. It is really facing the sea of spring, and the window sills are decorated with beautiful flowers and plants, and they look at the endless sea.The trestle bridge was close at hand, pushing open the window, and blowing the gentle sea breeze on the face; when the windows were turned off, there was no noise of the city.Let us really feel the comfort of the sea view room.Especially the lobby manager of the Oceanic celebrities, girls with tall and large eyes, a bit like Ni Ping, but more beautiful than Ni Ping in the youth.The attitude is particularly kind, serving the guests is particularly thoughtful, and can really think of the guests and anxious.Pay special attention to the needs of guests, timely understand and solve difficulties for guests.She always smiled, and she raised her hands and was particularly polite and professional.Even if there is some drizzle outside, she can send umbrellas to guests particularly thoughtfully and actively.I think she can be the image ambassador of Qingdao. She is beautiful and dignified, and she has the style and charm of traditional Chinese women.Go to Qingdao and live in the famous celebrities, and also hope that more friends will know this excellent, beautiful and generous, oriental female lobby manager.Thank you for bringing us a good holiday, and thank you for the quality service of the lobby manager and floor waiter.Guests from Beijing 2008/08/01"

1,住的是闽西宾馆新的六号楼~~新楼的装修、房间设施都很好~我开的是标间，房间够大，床也非常舒服，室内的灯光很柔和，窗外的夜景也不错，室内设施比较全，能上网，网速不错（网线可以找服务员要，不过长度只适合在办公桌上用，如果想在床上上网，建议大家带自己的网线）~比较喜欢它的浴室，通常一些宾馆不是淋浴房（太小），就是浴缸（总觉得脏），它的较简单但是感觉舒服，设施配备也比较齐全~~六号楼的早餐不错，是牛奶和糕点之类的~那的自助餐不错，最喜欢三文鱼和生蚝，冰淇淋也很好吃，还可以向厨师点东西~~,"I live in the new Building No. 6 in the western Minxi Hotel ~~ The decoration and room facilities of the new building are very good ~ I drive the standard room, the room is large enough, the bed is very comfortable, the lights in the room are soft, and the night scene outside the window is alsoYes, the indoor facilities are relatively complete, the Internet can be available, and the network speed is good (the network cable can find the waiter, but the length is only suitable for use on the desk. If you want to surf the Internet on the bed, it is recommended that you bring your own network cable) ~ I like its bathroom more,Usually some hotels are not shower rooms (too small), or bathtubs (always feel dirty). It is simpler but feels comfortable, and the facilities are relatively complete ~~ The breakfast in Building 6 is good, it is milk and pastry ~ ThenThe buffet is good, I like salmon and oysters the most, and ice cream is also delicious.

1,天府丽都喜来登饭店不错。价格比较实惠。硬件绝对够五星标准了。环境也很好。服务很到位。2007年3月入住了一次。寄存行李的人很友好位置靠近人民广场，绝对是黄金地段。就是门口的那条路是单行线，这个要大家注意,"Tianfu Liduitian Hotel is good.The price is more affordable.The hardware is definitely a five -star standard.The environment is also very good.The service is in place.He stayed in March 2007.The person who stores luggage is very friendly to the people's square, and it is definitely a golden location.The road at the door is a one -way line."
1,环境不错，设施也相对齐全。菜肴也比较美味。价格也适中。不错！强烈推荐！,The environment is good and the facilities are relatively complete.The dishes are also more delicious.The price is also moderate.good!highly recommended!
0,1、与携程网之间的沟通或流程方面出现问题，我明明预订了，但是该酒店经查询后答复我说我没有订，没有接到到携程的传真。2、好不容易住进了酒店，却不是我订的双床，而是给了我大床。联系总台，已经没有双床间，要我加钱住豪华间。我没答应，后来给了我一间双床的标间，但是骗我说是豪华间。3、一位姓陈的小姐服务态度极差，可能是大厅经理。总台小姐的态度还是很好。本来这个酒店我是住了好几次的，但是经过这次，下次再也不去住这个酒店了。包括我的朋友我也不会建议他们去入往。,"1. There is a problem with communication or processes between Ctrip.com. I clearly book, but after inquiry, the hotel answered that I did not order and did not receive faxes from Ctrip.2. I finally got into the hotel, but it was not the double bed I ordered, but gave me a big bed.Contact the head office, there is no double bed, I want me to add money to live in the luxurious room.I didn't agree, and later gave me a double -bed standard room, but it was a luxurious room to lie to me.3. A lady named Chen has a poor service attitude and may be the hall manager.Miss Taiwan's attitude is still very good.I had lived several times in this hotel, but after this time, I would never stay in this hotel again next time.I will not recommend them to go in, including my friends."
1,"再次入住海景花园大酒店仍感亲切,酒店员工热情不减,服务还是这样的到位,我入住过的威海其他几家四星酒店与它相比,服务不在一个档次上,海景花园确实不错,下次我还是会入住.我要提的意见是,酒店客房空调不太制冷,服务不能在这些地方留有瑕疵,希望得到改进.","Staying in the Sea View Garden Hotel again, I still feel kind. The hotel employees are enthusiastic and the service is still in place. Compared with several other four -star hotels I have been in Weihai, the service is not on the same level. The sea view garden is really good.I will still stay in. The opinions I want to mention is that the hotel's room air conditioner is not very refrigerated, and the service cannot leave flaws in these places. I hope to improve it. I hope to improve it."
1,宜昌的酒店普遍较老，半岛属于较新的，房间尚干净，设备也还齐全。除地理位置较偏外，其他都不错。但是洗衣服务不行，过了下午6点就不再服务了，需要改进。,"Yichang's hotels are generally older. The peninsula is relatively new, the rooms are clean, and the equipment is complete.Except for the geographical location, everything else is good.However, laundry services are not good. After 6 pm, it will not be served anymore, and it needs to be improved."
1,1、环境不错，离东百很近，就在东街口后面。2、房间不错，有电脑，可以免费上网。,"1. The environment is good, very close to Dongbai, just behind Dongjiekou.2. The room is good, there is a computer, you can go online for free."
0,性价比还不错，门面很不起眼，房间的设施还好，白天也不会太吵,"The cost -effective is not bad, the facade is very inconspicuous, the room facilities are okay, and it will not be too noisy during the day"
0,"8月刚住过,奉劝大家不要入住这家国营企业,客房服务员极恐怖,还未到中午12点退房时间,就把你的房间磁卡给取消了,私人的物品还都在房间里面,和他们大吵一架才解决,还打电话给携程的人求助,浪费不少时间.补充点评2006年9月18日：早餐也不怎么地","I just lived in August. I advised everyone not to stay in this state -owned enterprise. The guest room waiter was extremely horrible. Before the check -out time at 12 noon, the magnetic card of your room was canceled. The private items were still in the room, andThey were solved by a big quarrel, and they called the people of Ctrip for help. They waste a lot of time. Supplementary reviews on September 18, 2006: Breakfast is not very good"
0,简直受不了啊，居然有蟑螂，一共消灭了3只，作为1家4星的酒店居然这样很失望，而且上网速度简直太慢了,"I can't stand it. There are actually cockroaches. There are three of them. As a 4 -star hotel, a 4 -star hotel is so disappointed, and the Internet speed is too slow."
1,非常一般，房间很小，家具过时、老旧。性价比太差，订一晚，后又续一晚。实在不满意后俩日改住洲际酒店。我后面续订一日，居然不算通过携城预定！可能是利益所驱，相较之下，洲际我也是先订一日再续。洲际就处理的很好。补充点评2008年5月20日：还有，通过携城订的是大床房，去了变成标间。非常不愉快！,"Very general, the room is small, the furniture is out of date and old.The price / performance ratio is too bad, setting one night, and then one night.I was really dissatisfied with the intercontinental hotel two days after I was dissatisfied.I renewed one day later, but I didn't count it through the city!It may be driven by interests. In comparison, I also set up for one day before I renewed.Intercontinental is dealt with well.Supplementary comment on May 20, 2008: Also, the big bed room is set by the city, and it becomes a standard room.Very unhappy!"
1,性价比不错，我是住的东晖楼商务房，早餐也不错，门童不是很主动，押金是我住过的酒店里最高的，大堂主管很好，现在没带够，卡的密码又输错，导致押金交不足，主管帮我签了个字，舒心,"The price / performance ratio is good. I am the business house of Donghui Tower I live in. Breakfast is also good. The child is not very active. The deposit is the highest in the hotel I have lived. The lobby supervisor is very good., Resulting in insufficient deposit payment, the supervisor signed a word for me, comfortable"
1,"房间比较大,设备中规中矩啦,值得称赞的是环境,花园很舒服,毕竟是接待政府官员的酒店,还是很不错的.推荐.","The room is relatively large and the equipment is quite satisfactory. It is praised that the environment is very comfortable. After all, it is a hotel that receives government officials. It is still very good. Recommended."
1,我是八月底入住的该酒店，总的来说非常满意，除了位置没有在南京路的中心以外其他都很好。由于当时是旅游旺季出租车十分难打，星期五的傍晚我在豫园一带整整走了一个小时才如救命般的打到车，所以劝大家避开打车高峰。酒店我感觉相当超值，酒店服务员都很亲切，还不象金茂的服务员等在门口要小费，让人感觉很舒服。最好的一点是不管是交通还是就餐，有疑问的话尽管问酒店的服务处，酒店都会调查之后回复一个满意，全面的答案，还付有问候卡片和手写地图，很详细。总之去上海还会选择此酒店，房间各方面的软件和硬件设施都很好，不愧是有名气的酒店，物有所值,"I stayed at the hotel at the end of August. Generally speaking, I was very satisfied. Except that the location was not in the center of Nanjing Road, it was good.Because it was very difficult to hit the taxi during the tourist season at the time, I walked for an hour in the Yuyuan Garden in the evening of Friday to get the car like a life -saving, so I advised everyone to avoid the peak of the taxi.I feel quite value for hotels. The hotel waiters are very kind. They are not like Jin Mao's waiters and wait for a tip at the door, which makes people feel very comfortable.The best point is whether it is traffic or dining. If you have any questions, although you ask the hotel's service office, the hotel will investigate and reply to a satisfactory, comprehensive answer, and pay a greeting card and handwriting map, which is very detailed.In short, I will choose this hotel in Shanghai. The software and hardware facilities in all aspects of the room are very good. It is indeed a well -known hotel."
1,1.交通便利2.房间干净，装修的风格个人比较喜欢3.酒店周边环境不是很好，不过在市中心这一点可能无法做得太好4.服务态度还不错酒店的餐厅没去，下次有机会一定要吃一下传说中5元的炒米粉。,"1. Convenient transportation 2. The room is clean, and the decoration style personally prefer. 3. The surrounding environment of the hotel is not very good, but in the city center, it may not be done too well. 4. The service attitude is not bad.If you have a chance, you must eat the legendary 5 yuan fried rice noodles."
1,房间总体环境不错，而且还有提供免费上网，现在入住价格还可以，不过现在可是大连的旅游淡季了．但是有一点：就是早餐不但没含房费里，而且３２元的价格也不低，但是内容实在是很简单．,"The overall environment of the room is good, and there are also free Internet access. The price of staying in now is OK, but now it is the off -season in Dalian.But there is one point: not only does breakfast not contain room fees, but the price of 32 yuan is not low, but the content is really simple."
0,地理位置还不错，房间太小了，而且服务态度实在是太差了，我在全国住过很多酒店，第一次碰到，一到12：00必须退房的，一分钟都不能延时，如果需要延时需要按钟点房交费，当时跟前台理论时，大堂经理给出的解释其中有一个是：因为是携程用户，这个酒店对待携程的客户真的态度很差，因此建议携程的用户不要选择这个酒店，而且以后也不准备用携程卡订酒店了,"The geographical location is not bad, the room is too small, and the service attitude is too bad. I have lived in a lot of hotels in the country. For the first time, I must check out for the first time.If you need to delay, you need to pay the housing fee. At that time, when the front desk theory, one of the explanations given by the lobby manager is: Because it is a Ctrip user, the hotel has a poor attitude towards Ctrip.Don't choose this hotel, and you are not prepared to book the hotel with a Ctrip card in the future"
0,房间还算可以，不过前台服务人员的态度，受不了，我晚上11点多到酒店CHEKIN第二天退房的时候说，我房间里少了个小方巾，要我赔5元钱，可怜啊！我从进房间到退房，在洗手间台面上只有看到一块小方巾！为了5元钱，我和大堂副理交涉，没有办法，谁叫我进去的时候没有仔细检查下，房间的各项东西有没有少呢？算了，给他们5元又如何，不过我下次再也不会住这个酒店！奉劝各位要去住店的朋友，进房后千万要检查下有没有什么东西少了，因为海德是不会错的，他们检查过3遍了！真好笑！,"The room is okay, but the attitude of the front desk service staff can't stand it. When I got out of the hotel at 11 o'clock in the evening, I said that there was a small square scarf in my room and asked me to pay 5 yuan.ah!From entering the room to check -out, I only saw a small towel on the table on the bathroom!For 5 yuan, the deputy manager of the lobby and I had no choice but to ask me if I didn't check it carefully. Are there any few things in the room?Forget it, what about 5 yuan for them, but I will never live in this hotel again next time!I advise you to go to the store to stay in the store. After entering the room, you must check whether there is anything less, because Hyde is not wrong, they have checked 3 times!so funny!"
1,环境和服务都没的话说，不过暑期出行的结果就是到处人满为患，酒店的大堂都挤满CHECKIN的客人，不过前台的速度还是可以。让感觉不爽的是下午三点后才能入住，退房却是中午11点前，退房很方便，将房卡放在房间里拎着行李就可以走了，挺人性化的。房间很大，2大2小住着一点没有拥挤的感觉，比香港市内的房间大很多了。,"If there is no environmental and services, the result of the summer travel is that people are overwhelmed everywhere. The lobby of the hotel is crowded with Checkin guests, but the speed of the front desk is still ok.What makes you feel uncomfortable is to stay in after 3 pm, but check out before 11 noon. It is convenient to check out. Putting the room card in the room and holding your luggage can be left, which is quite humane.The room is very large, and the 2 big and 2 are a little bit crowded, which is much larger than the room in Hong Kong."
1,酒店位置可能有点偏，不过还好。酒店内部设施及服务态度值得一试,"The location of the hotel may be a bit biased, but okay.Internal facilities and service attitude of the hotel are worth trying"
1,地理位置很好，卧室和床都太小，房间格局不太好，厨房挺大，估计很少人会用，也没有沙发坐。,"The geographical location is very good, the bedrooms and beds are too small, the room structure is not good, the kitchen is quite large, it is estimated that few people will use it, and there is no sofa."
1,关于1元的保险费，钱虽少但你应该事先告知，哪有强买强卖的，因为赶时间所以就没计较，有时间一点好好理论一下。,"Regarding the insurance premium of 1 yuan, although the money is small, you should inform them in advance, how can there be strong buying and selling, because you do n’t care about it, you have a good theory."
1,酒店是千岛湖之旅的亮点，即使预期很高，9号楼还是给人惊喜，服务很好，不比5星差，餐厅也不错，跟鱼味馆区别不大，同行的朋友都赞不绝口，可惜时间太短，又被白云溪漂流忽悠浪费大半天，没住够，只好等下次了。回来后就推荐给同事、朋友。,"The hotel is the highlight of the journey of Qiandao Lake. Even if it is expected to be very high, Building No. 9 is still surprising. The service is very good, not worse than 5 stars, the restaurant is also good, the difference from fish flavor hall is not much.Unfortunately, the time was too short, and it was wasteed by Baiyunxi for a long time. I didn't live enough, so I had to wait for the next time.After returning, I recommend it to colleagues and friends."
0,"房间太小,宾馆有租四轮自行车的,很破,骑不动,后来服务员说他们的车都是东方绿舟淘汰的.酒巴装修的还可以,就是蚊子太多,象轰炸机.","The room was too small. The hotel had four rounds of bicycles. It was very broken and mobilized. Later, the waiters said that their cars were eliminated by the Oriental Green Boat. The wine was decorated, that is, there were too many mosquitoes, like bombers."
0,酒店服务非常差。早起出门时希望保安给我叫出租车。保安用嘴向外努努，然后说自己叫！！！！晚上回来办理续订手续，提出申请后前台女服务员坐着，面无表情，没有反应（当时前台就我一个顾客，绝对不是忙不过来），另一个服务员见状主动过来帮我办理。第二天离店结账，前台男服务生一边唱歌一边办理！！房间有股潮湿的味道，回房间后开窗通风，第二天依旧。这是我在携程订房后享受的最差的宾馆服务，建议大家以后都不要去这家店了！！！！！,"The hotel service is very poor.When I get up early, I hope the security guard will call me a taxi.The security guard used his mouth to Nu Nu, and then said he called!IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionWhen I came back to the renewal procedures at night, I proposed that the front desk female waiter was sitting, expressionless, and no response (at that time, I was a customer at the front desk, and I was definitely not busy). Another waiter came to help me to handle it.The next day left the store to check out, the front desk men's waiter sang while singing!IntersectionThe room has a humid taste. After returning to the room, the window is opened to ventilate, and the next day is still.This is the worst hotel service I enjoyed after Ctrip booking. I suggest you not go to this shop in the future!IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersection"
1,住过两次了，但真的没给人留下什么印象。早餐还比较丰盛，整体服务也还不错。湖南的酒店服务业感觉一般，所以这样的酒店还是不错的了。下次可能还会住这里。,"I have lived twice, but I really didn't have any impression.Breakfast is relatively abundant, and the overall service is not bad.The hotel service industry in Hunan feels average, so such a hotel is still good.I may still live here next time."
1,酒店地理位置不错，299的价格比较实惠，卫生间装修的很新。但是床太硬了，睡得不舒服。,"The hotel has a good geographical location, the price of 299 is more affordable, and the bathroom decoration is very new.But the bed is too hard and sleeps uncomfortably."
1,(1)房间卫生干净空间大!(2)早餐美味风富菜色多!,(1) The room is hygienic and clean! (2) Breakfast is delicious and rich in vegetables!
0,这种古老的没人住的酒店最好是不要在在携程网上出现了!,This kind of ancient uninhabited hotel is best not to appear on Ctrip.com!
1,"酒店装修有点旧,房间还算大,在北京三星酒店这个价格还算不贵,总体感觉还行!","The hotel decoration is a bit old, and the room is quite large. The price of the Samsung Hotel in Beijing is not expensive. The overall feeling is okay!"

1,"其实夏天去三亚旅游还是很合算的,价格绝对优惠,人也少得多...这个酒店夏天的性价比还算可以,冬天另说.位置不错,正对大东海广场,大堂很好很大,典型的三亚式风格,门窗都是永远开的,我住的是别墅,房间还算大,电视小点,不过也没时间看...早餐很简单.俄罗斯人很多.有个游泳池正对海岸,还正好碰上海军演习,开炮射击,咚咚响.","In fact, it is still very cost -effective to travel to Sanya in summer. The price is absolutely favorable, and there are much less people ... This hotel's summer price is okay. In winter, the location is good.The typical Sanya style, doors and windows are always open. I live in villas, the room is quite large, and the TV is small, but there is no time to watch ... The breakfast is very simple. There are many Swimming pools., Also happened to meet the naval exercises, firing artillery, rang."
1,"本来觉得这个宾馆住得挺好的,没想到退房的时候出事了,烟灰缸没了前台认定是我们拿了，我们一来全是女的不抽烟二来没小孩会打碎,真是奇了怪了,碰到这种事情真是说也说不清楚了,还好后来经理出现事情才算了结,没被继续冤枉.但是时间还是浪费了半个小时,还生了点气.前台态度不大好,房间挺宽敞,有电脑,海景也不错，但是到半夜的时候真的是太吵了，因为旁边就是马路，三亚市区好象没有禁止喇叭的规定,吵死了,没怎么睡好","Originally, I felt that this hotel lived well. I did not expect that there was an accident when I was at a check -out. The ashtray was gone. The front desk was determined that we took it. Once we were all women who did not smoke, the two were broken.Strange, I really ca n’t say it. Fortunately, the manager did n’t have a knot when it happened, but I did n’t continue to be wronged.The room is very spacious, there are computers, and the sea view is also good, but it is really too noisy in the middle of the night, because there is a road next to the road. There seems to be no provisions in Sanya urban area."
1,出差缘故在云龙酒店逗留一晚，提前通过携程预定，到达后被通知大床房已满，被免费升到25楼商务套房，房间超大，设施比较全面，不过商务套房内没有电脑比较遗憾，该酒店可能装修较早，地毯不是很清洁，其它方面非常满意，房间还提供了成都地图，赞一个,"For a long time, staying at Yunlong Hotel for one night, through Ctrip booking in advance, was notified of the large bed room after arrival, and was rising to the 25th floor business suites for free. The room was large and the facilities were relatively comprehensive. However, there was no computer in the business suite.The hotel may be renovated earlier, the carpet is not very clean, and other aspects are very satisfied. The room also provides a map of Chengdu."
0,价格，携程180，店头有活动价格179，如家还有自己的会员价格，都比携程低，携程订单一点竞争力都没有。房间，床太硬，电视在二楼比较不方便。屋子还算够大，就是设施比较陈旧，空调作用不明显，噪音还大。屋子里不干净。环境，就在吉林市最大的手机市场旁边，每天早上商店一开业，就开始一百多分贝的喇叭音乐、人语宣传，震死了！态度，服务台那位小姐不知道当天是不是心情不好，把情绪带到工作上来了，对客人态度极其生硬，还带搭不理的。令客人心情极差，如果不是替朋友定的房间，急于定下来地方的话，可能就不会入住了。位置，在北齐那个楼的侧面，外面很难看到。很多人甚至出租车司机都不知道在哪。总之，对这家店很不满意。,"Price, Ctrip 180, the price of the store has a price of 179. If the home and their own membership price are lower than Ctrip, Ctrip orders are not competitive at all.The room, the bed is too hard, and the TV is more inconvenient on the second floor.The house is quite large enough, that is, the facilities are relatively old, the effect of air conditioning is not obvious, and the noise is still strong.The house is not clean.The environment is next to the largest mobile phone market in Jilin City. As soon as the store opened every morning, more than 100 decibels of horn music and human language were promoted, and it was shocked!Attitude, the lady of the service desk does not know if she was in a bad mood that day, and brought emotions to work. It was extremely rigid to the guest's attitude and ignored it.The guests are in a bad mood. If it is not for the room for a friend, and anxious to settle the place, it may not stay.The location is difficult to see outside the side of the building in Beiqi.Many people don't even know where they are.In short, I am not satisfied with this shop."
0,请大家千万别住别墅，别墅的空调特差，很难制冷，而且经常半夜断电。酒店前台的服务意识很差，态度极为不好，明明有制冷好的主楼房间，就是不给携程的客户住。如果前台问你们别墅的房间可以不可以，一定不能同意。补充点评2008年7月15日：另外，早餐不太好，我们一般7点半去吃就没剩什么东西了，和团餐标准一样简单的不能再简单了。,"Please do not live in the villa. The air conditioning of the villa is difficult to refrigerate, and it is often disconnected in the middle of the night.The service awareness of the hotel's front desk is very poor, and the attitude is extremely bad. There is obviously a main building room with good refrigeration, that is, not to live for Ctrip's customers.If you ask your villa's room if you ask your villa, you must not agree.Add comments on July 15, 2008: In addition, breakfast is not good. Generally, we usually have nothing left to eat at 7:30. It is as simple as the group meals."
1,"早餐不错,挺丰富的.还提供免费接机服务,性价比高,交通很方便!","Breakfast is good, very rich. It also provides free pick -up services, high cost performance, and convenient transportation!"
0,亲身感受：在携程定房的时候，看清楚了148元的房间是有单早的，但是酒店前台死活就是说没有早餐的，结果花了10元。而且酒店给我的是他们酒店牌价148元的，所以根本没有优惠。checkin花了10分钟。把登记单都填好以后，前台的小伙子要确认有没有空房间，拿着对讲机和客房部的阿姨争，结果阿姨跑下楼说：“跟你说有3个房间”。我就坐在沙发上看他们争，争完了没有人理我。我跑到前台问：我checkin还要多少时间？小伙子看着我，你有什么事？愕然！！！晚上便便，便便绕着马桶兜了无数个圈子就是下不去。早晨checkout的时候问服务员为什么，连问两遍，连个茬都不理你，眼皮都不翻一下。俗话说店大欺客，是这样的吗？,"Personal feelings: When Ctrip's fixed room, I saw that the room of 148 yuan was single early, but the hotel's front desk was dead. There was no breakfast, and it took 10 yuan.And the hotel gives me a price of 148 yuan for their hotel, so there is no discount at all.Checkin took 10 minutes.After filling in the registration list, the guy at the front desk must confirm that there is a room for room, holding the walkie -talkie with the aunt in the guest room, but the aunt ran downstairs and said, ""There are 3 rooms to you.""I sat on the sofa to watch them fight, and no one cared about me.I ran to the front desk and asked: How much time does I checkin?The young man looks at me, what are you doing?Stunning!IntersectionIntersectionAt night, when the toilet was wrapped around countless circles, it was impossible to go.When you checkout in the morning, ask the waiter why, ask the waiter twice, even ignore you, and your eyelids will not be turned over.As the saying goes, is the shop bullying, is this like this?"
1,"第一次和老板一起出差，听熟人推荐订在这家酒店。办入住手续时。前台员工和值班经理一路的服务都很热情。观察了一下，酒店的地理位置相当好，就在市政府的斜对面,出行很方便。附近有很多酒吧和餐馆，斜对面还有一家星吧克。晚上吃过饭在市政府广场散步，看看喷泉，回来再到三楼享受一下免费的健身游泳，感觉很惬意。我这次住的是精致大床房，床够宽够大，宽带也是免费的。整体感觉很温馨也很干净，据说平时这种房都很抢手，不提早订都订不到。顺便提一下，我给老板订了行政楼层的豪华房，红木贴金箔的欧式家具显得很有档次，老板很满意。据说他们家的早餐价格不贵，品种却比上海很多五星酒店还要丰盛,不过遗憾的是这次因为走得仓促没来得及去试试。总之感觉这家酒店很超值啦,以后到昆山都会住在那里。","For the first time with the boss, I listened to the acquaintance and recommended to book in this hotel.When checking in the procedures.The front desk employees and duty managers are very enthusiastic.After observing, the hotel's geographical location is quite good. It is convenient to travel in the municipal government.There are many bars and restaurants nearby, and there is a star in the opposite side.I took a meal at night and took a walk in the square of the city government, looked at the fountain, and came back to the third floor to enjoy the free fitness swimming. It felt very comfortable.I live in a large bed room this time. The bed is wide and large, and the broadband is free.The overall feeling is very warm and clean. It is said that this kind of house is usually very popular, and it cannot be ordered early.By the way, I ordered the luxury room of the administrative floor for the boss. The European -style furniture of the mahogany foil seemed very grade, and the boss was very satisfied.It is said that the price of their breakfast is not expensive, but the variety is more richer than many five -star hotels in Shanghai, but unfortunately, this time, I did not have time to try it because of my hasty walk.In short, I feel that this hotel is very good value, and I will live there in Kunshan in the future."
1,还行吧，早餐不错，超出我的预期，比一般三星的好！不过去连云港住新区那边比较好！新区有一家：老班长的饭店不错，部队人开的，送小菜送水果，送有一道豆腐包，很不错！,"It's okay, breakfast is good, beyond my expectations, better than ordinary Samsung!But it is better to go to Lianyungang to live in the New District!There is a new district: the restaurant of the old squad leader is good. The troops are opened. It is very good!"
1,"房间不错,大堂不怎么样,服务水平一般,早餐还过得去","The room is good, the lobby is not good, the service level is average, and the breakfast is still available"
1,房间设施很好。服务质量一般。去餐厅就餐，酒吧消遣，最好带一个扩音喇叭。不然很可能，连呼数声都没人搭理你。宾馆反馈2008年4月14日：谢谢您对酒店产品的认可，酒店将加强培训，提高员工的服务技能。,"The room facilities are very good.The quality of service is average.Go to the restaurant for dinner, the bar pastime, it is best to bring a pourse speaker.Otherwise, no one cares about you even the sound of calling.Hotel feedback on April 14, 2008: Thank you for your recognition of hotel products. The hotel will strengthen training and improve employees' service skills."
1,"7月25到27,住了三天,从酒店的房间里望外面,能看到海景及红砖的房屋,环境非常美丽,服务也不错,每天有小点心及两朵鲜花送,很温情.没有吃早餐,无法评论.房间的电视不是液晶的,设施稍微旧些,但是座在靠窗的沙发上看书,感觉非常好.本想带着小孩去酒店的泳池游泳,但是太深了,小孩不敢下去.交通也方便,出来就有公交车站,往对面座车可以去栈桥,中山公园,青少年帆船中心,这面座车可以去五四广场及奥帆中心.住在该酒店还是感觉不错的.但是,后来去了汇泉王朝酒店25楼吃早餐,发现风景更漂亮,因为该酒店下面过街就是海水浴场,还是青少年帆船训练基地.另外又有本地人说应该住在八大关,因为有些酒店推门出来就是海滩.下次可以试试.","From July 25th to 27th, I lived for three days. Looking out from the hotel's room, I can see the houses of sea views and red bricks. The environment is very beautiful and the service is good. There are small snacks and two flowers every day. It is very tender.No breakfast, you can't comment. The TV in the room is not a liquid crystal. The facilities are slightly old, but I read a book on the sofa of the window and feel very good.Don't dare to go on. The traffic is also convenient. If you come out, there is a bus station. You can go to the side of the seat opposite to the trestle, Zhongshan Park, Youth Sailing Center.Yes. But, I went to the 25th floor of the Huiquan Dynasty Hotel to eat breakfast and found that the scenery was more beautiful, because the hotel was passing the street under the street, or the youth sailing training base.Some hotels push the door to be the beach. You can try it next time."
0,与其说是饭店不如说是招待所。早餐品种少而且质量也不高，最不能令人接受的是盛早餐的餐具（盘子，碗）里面都汪着水。唰过后的水根本就被弄干净，恐怕更提不上消毒。补充点评2007年10月8日：哦，忘记了，酒店送水果，这点是不错的。,"It is not so much a hotel.The breakfast varieties are small and the quality is not high. What is most unacceptable is the tableware (plates, bowls) of breakfast.After the water, the water was cleaned at all, and I am afraid it won't be more disinfected.Supplementary comment on October 8, 2007: Oh, forgot, the hotel to send fruits, which is good."
1,这是第二次入住次酒店。3年前第一次，除了价格上涨之外，其他各方面都比较满意。性价比在青岛来说还是不错的。服务没有什么特别出彩的地方，也没有什么不好的地方。酒店占地很大，绿地很多，环境优雅，都是几层的老建筑，唯一不好的是没有电梯，行李需要提上提下，建议酒店要配备负责的行礼员。还有洗完地毯，上面能不能不要铺那些破布，看着比较难受。,"This is the second time to stay in the hotel.For the first time three years ago, except for rising prices, other aspects were relatively satisfied.The cost -effectiveness is still good in Qingdao.There is nothing particularly outstanding in the service, and there is nothing bad.The hotel occupies a large area, has a lot of green spaces, and has an elegant environment. It is a few old buildings. The only bad thing is that there is no elevator. The luggage needs to be mentioned. It is recommended that the hotel should be equipped with a responsible salute.There is also a carpet, whether it can be paved on it, it looks uncomfortable."
0,国际饭店虽然挂牌3星，但是设施和服务差了一些，而且携程提供的价格不大有竞争力，在另外一个酒店：梅林大酒店住过两次，前台的价格就256，设施比国际要好不少。另外：邯郸现在有个赵王宾馆刚刚盖了新楼，是4星的，已经开始营业，住过一次，够4星标准，应该是邯郸目前最好的宾馆，标间前台的价格384，建议携程联系下。补充点评2008年5月7日：强力推荐赵王宾馆,"Although the International Hotel is listed 3 stars, the facilities and services are worse, and the price provided by Ctrip is not very competitive. It has stayed in another hotel: Merlin Hotel twice. The price of the front desk is 256.few.In addition: Handan now has a new building. It is 4 stars. It has begun to open and lives once. It is enough for 4 stars standards. It should be the best hotel in Handan.Ctrip contact.Supplementary comment on May 7, 2008: strong recommendation of Zhao Wang Hotel"
0,整体感觉酒店比较小，从大堂、电梯、走廊、客房到卫生间都比较小，最不能容忍的是那个小坐便，大小便几乎不能同时进行，还有传染性病的危险。客房的壁纸坏的很厉害，停车场房客还收费，感觉不好。建议酒店尽快把那个小坐便换掉，否则真的没人敢入住了。,"The overall feels that the hotel is relatively small. It is relatively small from the lobby, elevator, corridor, guest rooms to the bathroom. The least tolerance is the small sitting. The urine can hardly be carried out at the same time, as well as the danger of infectious diseases.The wallpaper of the rooms is very bad, and the parking lots are charged and it feels bad.It is recommended that the hotel replaced the little sitting as soon as possible, otherwise no one would dare to stay."
1,1.服务非常好，这次是第二次来，发现加送了苹果，报纸，还有大堂会打电话询问入住情况，服务生也很主动热情。2.离火车站和民航大厦近，第一次来就是看中了去坐机场巴士很近，处在旧市区的繁华路段，就餐购物等都方便。,"1. The service is very good. This time, I came for the second time. I found that the apple, newspapers, and lobby would call to ask about the situation. The waiter was also very enthusiastic.2. Near the railway station and the Civil Aviation Building. The first time I came to see it was very close to the airport bus. It was in the bustling section of the old urban area."
1,不错的酒店，在柳州属于最好的了。周围环境也很好。,Good hotels are the best in Liuzhou.The surrounding environment is also very good.
0,我主在709房间，该房间空调声音巨大(门外都可以听到)，浴缸没有防滑垫，浴缸水龙头把手轻轻一碰便会整个脱落，房间没有灯光总控制。电话竟然是坏的，没有声音。饭店入口很难找，前台不但小，而且一片混乱。,"My master is in Room 709. The room has a huge air conditioning sound (you can hear it outside the door). There is no anti -slip pad in the bathtub.The phone turned out to be bad and there was no sound.The restaurant entrance is difficult to find. The front desk is not only small, but also chaotic."
1,"入住了一晚,感觉携程的价格和自己打电话预定的价格相差不大,没有优势.订的是3号楼所谓行政楼的豪华园景房,结果住下一看,窗户对的是酒店内部的马路,根本没有园景看看.所以要么直接订湖景或者是经济房.酒店更象是度假村,娱乐设施全,中餐厅的风景不错,全景玻璃对着太湖大桥.但价格不好.如果吃饭,不如去西山镇上吃.房间设施还可以.点评","After staying for one night, I felt that the price of Ctrip was not much different from the price of calling by myself, and there was no advantage. I ordered the luxury park scene in the so -called administrative building of Building 3. As a result, I lived in the next look.There is no garden view at all. So either order lake views or economic houses directly. The hotel is more like a resort, entertainment facilities, and the scenery of Chinese restaurants is good. The panoramic glass is facing the Taihu Bridge. But the price is not good. If the price is not good. If the price is not good.To eat, it is better to go to Xishan Town to eat. The room facilities are okay. Comments"
0,设施太陈旧了，服务很差劲，态度恶劣。,"The facilities are too old, the service is poor, and the attitude is bad."
1,装修简洁实用，但电源插口少，要配个接线器为好。另外浴缸的hot龙头请配图示，第一次来的一定弄很久。酒店lobby太大，早餐要历经磨难,"The decoration is simple and practical, but there are fewer power sockets. It is better to match a wirler.In addition, please be equipped with a hotel faucet for the bathtub.The hotel lobby is too big, breakfast has to be suffered"
1,"性价比不错的酒店,交通也很方便,值得一提是,宾馆斜对面走不多远就是海鲜一条街,很便宜,很实惠,下次去深圳还住广深.","The cost -effective hotel is also very convenient. It is worth mentioning that the hotel is not far from the opposite side of the hotel. It is a seafood street. It is very cheap and affordable. Next time, I will live in Shenzhen."
1,"绝对是超值的一家酒店.如果不是要求豪华享受,这家酒店的每一部分都绝对可以令人满意.(AvlNtTy)","It is definitely a value -for -money hotel. If it is not required to enjoy luxury, each part of this hotel is definitely satisfactory. (AVLNTTY)"
0,地理位置实在太差，就是在城乡结合部。服务意识也没有。出门叫车是完全不可能的。早饭吃了煎鸡蛋后，1个小时后就和同伴一起在轮流找厕所，拉了1天才好。。。。补充点评2008年5月4日：楼下的估计好多都是马甲，居然还有人说这家酒店好的。,"The geographical location is too bad, that is, in the urban and rural areas.There is no service consciousness.It is completely impossible to call a car at all.After eating fried eggs for breakfast, I took turns to find the toilet with my companions for 1 hour.EssenceEssenceEssenceSupplementary comment on May 4, 2008: Many of the estimates downstairs are vests, and some people say that this hotel is good."
1,"以前曾多次入住瀛洲酒店,这次的早餐质量和选择的品种比原来有所提高.",I used to stay at the Puzhou Hotel many times. The quality of breakfast and the variety of selection this time have improved.
1,首次预订入住精致套房，没有想像的好，感觉装修有点陈旧了。电视机位在卧房，在中间厅里看就嫌小了，不像在上海住的绿地豪生全套房酒店，卧室和厅是各有一个电视的。床和枕头还是比较舒服的，晚上可以睡得很好。上网线的插头有点接触不良，建议更换。酒店大堂在三楼，有点怪。,"The first time I book a refined suit, I have no imagination, and I feel that the decoration is a bit old.The TV is in the bedroom, and it is too small in the middle hall. Unlike the Greenland Hao Sheng full -house hotel in Shanghai, the bedroom and hall have a TV.The beds and pillows are still more comfortable and can sleep well at night.The plugs on the Internet cable are a bit poorly exposed, and it is recommended to replace it.The hotel lobby is a bit strange."
1,"酒店服务亲切,我们当时喝红酒没有开瓶器，打电话给客房部，专门给我们送了过来，非常感谢。同时麻将免费租借也是非常人性的服务。缺点是，酒店别墅的设备比较陈旧，早餐也比较单调。还有附近的交通实在是不怎么方便。补充点评2008年6月23日：没有吹风机希望可以准备。另外就是牧屋区和内部游览区增加一些指示牌就更好了，我朋友进去找马场找了好久，最后不得不打电话咨询。对了，还有客房部的服务人员非常好，我们退房的时候朋友拉下了手机，等我们走了以后，他们专门打电话过来。多谢阿","The hotel service was kind. At that time, we did not open the bottle in drinking red wine. I called the guest room department and gave us specially. Thank you very much.At the same time, the free lease of Mahjong is also a very human service.The disadvantage is that the equipment and villa equipment are more old and breakfast is relatively monotonous.There is also not very convenient transportation nearby.Supplementary comment on June 23, 2008: No hair dryer is hoping to prepare.In addition, it is even better to add some signs in the pastoral area and internal tour areas. My friend went to find the racecourse for a long time, and finally had to call to consult.By the way, the service staff of the guest room department is very good. When we got out, our friends pulled out the mobile phone. After we left, they called it specifically.Thank you"
1,"这家酒店我是到那里才预定的.认为CTRIP的价格没有竞争力.房间可以免费宽带上网.房间大小适中.给我印象最深的是针线包.里面有纸尺,迷你剪刀,十种颜色的线,两根针.早餐对五星来说品种不多.味道、服务、环境还不错.还可以免费使用保龄球1小时.而且不查房.只问一下使用过冰箱里的食品吗?前台也许太忙了,让我等了一段时间,但说了抱歉,久等.但是在走廊遇到的服务员招呼也不打,不太符合五星标准.","I booked this hotel there. I believe that the price of CTRIP is not competitive. The room can be free to go to the Internet. The size of the room is moderate. The most impressive is the needle wire bag. There are paper ruler, mini scissors, ten colors of color.Line, two stitches. Breakfast is not much for five stars. The taste, service, and environment are not bad. You can also use the bowling ball for 1 hour. And do not check the room. Do you only ask the food in the refrigerator?Busy, let me have waited for a while, but I'm sorry, wait for a long time. But the waiter I met in the corridor greeted and did not fight, not in line with the five -star standard."
1,房间过小，至多三星级标准，价格偏高，跟南阳的生活水平相背，房间有异味,"The room is too small, at most three -star standards, the price is high, and the living standards of Nanyang are back. The room has a odor."
1,性价比不错的，应有的设施都有，离皇岗口岸也近的，感觉酒店比较老了点，差不多也该装修装修了，送的早餐在隔壁的酒楼就餐，那个酒楼的管理很不好，订了餐老半天才送到。,"The cost -effective is good, there are all facilities, and it is close to the Huanggang port. I feel that the hotel is older. Almost the decoration should be decorated. The breakfast is to eat in the restaurant next door.I booked the meal for half a day."
1,"酒店位置很方便,离开封第一楼和夜市非常近,酒店早餐10元自助很实惠,服务也不错但房间很大设施却有些旧，尤其卫生间狭小。","The location of the hotel is very convenient. It is very close to the first floor and the night market. The hotel breakfast is 10 yuan buffet. It is very affordable. The service is also good, but the large facilities in the room are a bit old, especially the bathroom is small."
1,酒店陈旧，但房间暖气供应很足，非常好！宽带速度很快，非常方便。只是早餐时的红茶，咖啡需提高，口感和颜色均令人无所适从。三楼酒吧非正常人能享受，特别是女性。一楼的大堂吧很冷，无法在酒店找到可以餐后轻松聊天的地方。,"The hotel is old, but the room heating is very good, very good!Broadband is fast and very convenient.It is just that the black tea during breakfast needs to be improved, and the taste and color are at a loss.The third floor bar can enjoy, especially women.The lobby on the first floor is very cold, and you can't find a place where you can easily chat after meals."
1,位置还好，不算太难找，屋内比较干净，卫生间装修不错，木制的氛围比较喜欢。没窗户，但是夏天住空调房也不是很需要窗户，所以能接受。,"The position is okay, it is not too difficult to find, the house is relatively clean, the bathroom decoration is good, and the atmosphere of wooden is preferred.There is no window, but living in the air -conditioned room in the summer does not need windows, so it can be accepted."
1,宾馆周围环境不错，离商业区很近，而且幽静。不过宾馆有些老了，装修都过时了。,"The surrounding environment around the hotel is good, close to the commercial area, and quiet.However, the hotel is old and the decoration is out of date."
0,上网的宽带不太稳定，同事入住的时候都会带一个CDMA上网卡。。,"The broadband on the Internet is not stable, and colleagues will bring a CDMA Internet card when they move in.Essence"
1,城堡酒店绝对是修身养性绝佳地方~~~我住的好的宾馆不少~~可以说在上海、深圳、大连、北京~~绝对找不到象这么个一个极具英国皇家别墅的感觉了~~！！英皇欧式城堡住房~~配上罗马柱凉亭（高至少5米）作为城堡2翼~~豪华气派的主楼大厅~~~宽广美丽的巨型广场~~~~大片大片的草原~~~而且城堡四周被宽至少10米的护城河保,"The castle hotel is definitely a great place for self -cultivation ~~~ There are a lot of good hotels I live in ~~ It can be said that in Shanghai, Shenzhen, Dalian, Beijing ~~ I can never find such a Royal British Villa ~~!IntersectionEmperor European Castle Housing ~~ Coupled with the Roman pillar gazebo (at least 5 meters high) as the 2 wings of the castle ~~ The main building lobby of luxury and elegant school ~~~ The wide and beautiful giant square ~~~~The moat with at least 10 meters wide"
1,"这家酒店离车站很近,较方便,CHECKIN时,服务还好,还有凉茶饮用,酒店早餐还不错,只是8:30时,品种已没有多少了,住的是6楼的单间,上网是免费的,很满意!床比较舒服,空间不大,特别是家俱颜色太深了,房间价格还能接受!","This hotel is very close to the station, which is more convenient. When checkin, the service is good, and the herbal tea is good. The hotel breakfast is not bad. It is not much of the variety at 8:30.Free, very satisfied! The bed is more comfortable and the space is not large, especially the color of the furniture is too dark, and the price of the room is still acceptable!"
0,特价房环境非常不好，只有一扇非常小的气窗通向宾馆过道，有点象住在地下室的感觉。房间下水道还往上翻难闻的臭气。请慎重选择此宾馆。,"The special room environment is very bad. There is only a very small window to the aisle of the hotel, which is a bit like living in the basement.The waterway in the room also touched the bad smell.Please choose this hotel carefully."
1,酒店离机场太远去的时候打车大概得50元左右，等回来的时候出租车要80元（据说是走什么外环什么的），到了酒店，办手续的速度还可以，态度也很好，早餐也挺好吃，房间也挺好，就是有点冷（很冷），让服务员来看过，也没有修好，住了一宿冻感冒了，不过，总体来说还行。宾馆反馈2008年5月6日：感谢您的点评，我们已经每月定期对所有房间空调做统一检测，尽量避免类似事情的发生。给您造成的不便，深感歉意。,"When the hotel is too far away from the airport, it takes about 50 yuan to take a taxi. When I come back, the taxi costs 80 yuan (it is said that what is the outer ring or something)?The breakfast is also very delicious, and the room is very good, but it is a bit cold (very cold). The waiter has seen it and did not repair it. I lived a cold and a cold. However, it was okay overall.Hotel feedback on May 6, 2008: Thank you for your comments. We have regularly tested all room air conditioners every month to avoid similar things as possible.I apologize to the inconvenience caused by you."
1,"一进花园酒店的大门就能看到游泳池和网球场,以及经过精心修整的花园,一种突然的宁静感油然而生.前台接待快速而有序,我发现他们的英语比三亚某些五星级酒店的前台接待还要说得流畅和准确一些.进得房间更让人感到物超所值(我住的贵宾楼行政大床房),房间里居然配了电脑,而且宽带免费!我以挑剔的眼光仔细打量了房间的每一个角落,近乎完美,唯一的瑕疵便是淋浴房,其问题是洗澡时水要外溢,弄湿了卫生间的地板.酒店的西餐,中餐都不错.基于上述理由,我又续住了一天.该酒店的软硬件均不错,我相信,在不久的将来,它一定会荣升为五星级酒店的.","As soon as you enter the gate of the Garden Hotel, you can see the swimming pool and tennis court, and the carefully trimmed garden. A sudden tranquility is born. The front desk is fast and orderly.The front desk reception of the hotel must be said smoothly and accurately. The room to enter the room is even more worthy of money (the VIPs I live in the administrative large bed room).The picky eyes carefully looked at every corner of the room, almost perfect, the only flaw is the shower room. The problem is that the water is overflowing during the bath, and the floor of the bathroom is wet.I continued another day. The hotel's software and hardware are all good. I believe that in the near future, it will definitely be promoted to a five -star hotel."
1,我是2008年4月29日入住到该酒店，感觉环境舒适，酒店设施完备，服务业很周到，离火车站和泉城广场很近，就是打折的房间没有早餐，我觉得应该降低早餐标准，含在打折房费里，总体感觉是一家不错的酒店，适合商务人士下榻。,"I stayed at the hotel on April 29, 2008. I felt comfortable with the environment, the hotel facilities were complete, and the service industry was very thoughtful. It was very close to the train station and Quancheng Square. There was no breakfast in the discounted room. I think it should be reduced.In the discount fee, it is generally a good hotel that is suitable for business people."
1,感觉还可以，价格也不错！在当地也没有认真去看其他酒店，比较也不大。,"It feels okay, the price is also good!I did not take a serious look at other hotels in the local area, and it was not much comparable."
1,我们住的是行政海景房，房间有配传真机和免费宽带，窗外全海景和园景，非常开扬，园内泳池很大，全海景健身房超棒。早餐也挺不错，咖啡很香，东西也很好吃，可惜只包一位早餐，另一位买单要92元，太贵，70元就可以接受。我们吃饭都是在中餐厅吃的，出品总的来说清淡可口。,"We live in administrative sea view rooms. The rooms are equipped with authentic machines and free broadband. The full sea views and garden views outside the window are very open.Breakfast is also pretty good, coffee is very fragrant, and things are delicious. Unfortunately, only one breakfast is included, and the other one pays 92 yuan, too expensive, and it is acceptable to 70 yuan.We eat in Chinese restaurants, and the general products are light and delicious."
1,环境一流，庭院深深，小桥流水，枯藤老树昏鸦。多次入住。只是早餐极其惨淡，无论中西，希望改进。,"The environment is first -class, the courtyard is deep, the small bridge flows, and the old tree is old tree.Check in many times.It's just that breakfast is extremely bleak, regardless of Chinese and Western, I hope to improve."
0,"有没有搞错,我的点评为什么不登出来.你们网站只维护酒店的利益就不管客户的感受吗?我现在还感冒着呢!这是什么世道....补充点评2008年3月13日：对这家酒店的服务我只有两个形容,太差.服务员的素质:一分.暖气小到我感冒到现在还没有好.宾馆反馈2008年5月20日：您在入住酒店期间有不愉快的经历，我们非常抱歉。我们会努力改正您提出的意见，加强员工的教育，真诚希望您的再次光临！","Is there any mistake, why not log in for my comments? Do you only maintain the interests of the hotel, regardless of the customer's feelings? I still caught a cold!

0,新乡国家饭店入住纪实：1.入住第一个房间，电视关不上，一直开着。服务员建议换房间。2.换的房间空调不行，又换房。我们拿着行李跟着跑。3.换的第三间房是有烟房，我们问：有没有无烟房？服务员告诉我们：我把烟缸拿走就行了。哭笑不得！4.晚上去餐厅大厅就餐，点完餐后，服务员告知：最低消费35元\人。我们不能理解，服务员告知：酒店的新规定。电话投诉后，来人讲：服务员是新来的不知道。,"Xinxiang National Hotel stays in the documentary: 1.

1,这个酒店真不错，房间超大，卫浴设施很干净，窗子很大阳光充足。美中不足，餐厅不敢恭维。但服务人员态度超好，本人在住店期间身体不适得到了家人一般的照顾，感激得很！强力推荐！,"This hotel is really good, the room is large, the bathroom facilities are clean, and the window is large.Insufficient in the United States and China, the restaurant dare not compliment.However, the attitude of the service staff is very good. During my stay in the store, I was taken care of by my family discomfort. I was very grateful!Highly recommended!"

1,来武汉出差很多次了，这次经朋友介绍，住在海怡锦江大酒店。外表看来的确一般，但住进去后，感觉还不错，小巧精致。首先地理位置好，隔壁就是省政府，早晚出门就可在洪山广场散步，交通非常方便，闹中取静，朋友说这里属于武昌的中心地段。特别喜欢房间里的数字电视还能上网，书桌上还也配了液晶显示屏电脑，网速是我曾经住过的酒店最快的，且不收费，这是让我最满意的。楼下有位朋友说，卫生间太小，其实只是淋浴间不是太大，我这近1.80的个子也还行啊，哈哈。不过我还不喜欢浴缸呢，总让人不放心。携程价格嘛也还行，我在网上比较过，和周边酒店相比还是物有所值的，员工服务素质还行，有机会还会住这里的。酒店的机场大巴经询问大堂经理说，是由于机场大巴路线调整，机场单方面临时取消，酒店方还在努力。但愿酒店努力成功，这样就更方便了。只是房间的地毯有些陈旧，服务员说，酒店马上就要更换了。,"I have come to Wuhan many times. This time I was introduced by a friend and lived in the Haiyi Jinjiang Hotel.It seems that the appearance is really average, but after living in, it feels good, small and exquisite.First of all, the geographical location is good. The next door is the provincial government. When you go out sooner or later, you can take a walk in Hongshan Plaza. The transportation is very convenient. It is quiet in trouble. Friends say that it belongs to the central part of Wuchang.I especially like digital TVs in the room. I can also access the Internet. The desk is also equipped with a LCD display computer. The speed of the network is the fastest in the hotel I have lived in, and it is not charged. This is the most satisfactory to me.A friend downstairs said that the bathroom was too small, but it was not too big in the shower room. My nearly 1.80 man was okay, haha.But I don't like the bathtub yet, it is always uneasy.The price of Ctrip is okay. I have compared it online. Compared with the surrounding hotels, it is still worthwhile. The quality of employees is okay, and I will live here.The hotel's airport bus was inquired about the lobby manager said that due to the adjustment of the airport bus route, the airport unilaterally canceled, and the hotel side was still working hard.I hope the hotel is successful, which is more convenient.It was only a lot of old carpets in the room. The waiter said that the hotel was about to replace it soon."
1,酒店的接待人员还是很热情，就是餐厅的餐太难吃，服务很好，知道我们要一早去酒泉，餐厅还在没开餐前给我们打了包，很感谢！就是明明在那里住了2天，而且第二天还加开了一间房。可是只反映了一天一间，害的携程的工作人员都打了N次电话核对，真是以小是大！心中对这家酒店的感觉一下就十分不好。不要住临街的，窗玻璃不隔音。,"The hotel's reception staff is still very enthusiastic, that is, the meal of the restaurant is too unpalatable and the service is very good. Knowing that we have to go to Jiuquan in the morning, the restaurant has packed us before the meal. Thank you very much!It was obviously living there for 2 days, and a room was added the next day.But only one day, the staff of the harmed Ctrip have made N times to check the phone, which is really small!The feeling of this hotel is very bad.Don't live on the street, window glass is not sounded."
0,地址错误环境糟糕服务不到位有点上当的感觉,The address is wrong.
1,本次此次入住非常愉快，我住的是标准间，房间设施完善条件不错，尤其是酒店的环境非常非常的好，呵呵住在这里很惬意，前台服务态度也很好，早晨的自助餐也不错。只是入住时没有人帮我拿行李，自己提着很重的行李上4楼郁闷。提醒大家的是他的阳光间只是在天棚上有个小窗户，四周是没有窗户的。再者酒店位置一般，不过离都江堰的秦岳楼和二王庙很近：）价位前台标价是580元而且不打折，携程348元的价格还是比较有竞争力的。总之下次入住还会选择这里的。,"This time I stayed very happy. I lived in the standard room. The improvement of the room facilities was good, especially the hotel's environment was very, very good, it was very comfortable to live here, the front desk service attitude was also very good, the morning buffets were also good.EssenceIt was just that no one helped me get my luggage during the check -in. I was depressed on the fourth floor with a heavy luggage on my own.Remind everyone that his sunshine room only had a small window on the ceiling, and there were no windows around.Furthermore, the hotel location is average, but it is very close to Qin Yuelou and Erwang Temple from Dujiangyan :) The price at the front desk is 580 yuan and does not discount. The price of Ctrip 348 yuan is still more competitive.In short, I will choose here the next time."
1,1、第一次入住这个酒店感觉很好，房间的设施高级，很温馨，酒店的客房服务很细致，无意中与服务员提到房间的空调声响，下午回到酒店就得到了解决。2、酒店的中西式自助早餐丰盛，而且质量不错，特别是当地特产的云耳、笋等天然绿色食品很棒。3、酒店在交通上非常便捷，离机场只有7公里，到旅游景点仅20分车程，而且酒店有安排免费接机服务，司机李师傅很有礼貌，热情周到。4、特别值得一赞的是酒店的客房有免费提供拨打国内长途电话、水果、免费品武夷山岩茶等超值服务，总之相比武夷山其它同级酒店性价比高，非常值得给大家推荐。5、武夷山之旅非常愉悦！补充点评2007年11月2日：非常好的酒店，房间舒适，服务好。中西自助早餐也很丰富，还有免费水果及茶艺棋牌室消费券。白天游山玩水，晚上活动也很丰富。总之一个字“好”。下次去武夷山再选择住海晟酒店。,"1. The first time I was in this hotel, I felt very good. The room's facilities were high -level and very warm. The hotel's room service was very detailed. I accidentally mentioned the sound of the room in the room with the waiter. After returning to the hotel in the afternoon, it was resolved.2. The hotel's Chinese and Western buffet breakfast is rich in quality, and the quality is good, especially the natural green foods such as cloud ears and bamboo shoots of local specialties.3. The hotel is very convenient in transportation. It is only 7 kilometers away from the airport. It is only 20 points at the tourist attraction. The hotel has a free pick -up service. The driver Master Li is very polite and warm and thoughtful.4. It is particularly worthy of praise that the hotel rooms are free to provide value services such as calling domestic long -distance calls, fruits, free products Wuyishan Rock Tea. In short, compared with the high cost -effectiveness of other hotels in Wuyi Shan, it is worth recommending to everyone.5. The trip to Wuyishan is very happy!Supplementary reviews November 2, 2007: Very good hotel, comfortable room and good service.Chinese and Western buffet breakfast is also very rich, as well as free fruits and tea and chess and chess room consumer coupons.Touring mountains and water during the day is also rich in activities at night.In short, the word is ""good"".Next time I go to Wuyi Mountain and choose to stay in Haisheng Hotel."
1,"景观不错,早晨醒来在床上就能看到蓝天白云,脚下是缓缓流过的江水,感觉确实不错.补充点评2007年9月13日：距离汽车站不算远,但走路过去也不算近.酒店附近没什么吃的.","The landscape is good. You can see the blue sky and white clouds in the bed when you wake up in the morning. Under the foot is the slow flowing river, it feels good. Supplementary reviews on September 13, 2007: Not far from the bus station, but it is not considered walking in the past.Near.

1,地理环境不错，购物吃饭都方便，就是房间隔音效果不好,"The geographical environment is good, shopping and eating are convenient, that is, the room sound insulation is not good"
0,特价房间根本没有窗户，空气十分差，房间设施也十分差，是原来饭馆包房改造的，预定时，携程根本没有对此情况进行告知，十分气愤！！！！,"There are no windows at all in the special room, the air is very poor, and the room facilities are very poor. It was transformed by the original restaurant's private room. When it was scheduled, Ctrip did not inform this situation at all, and was very angry!IntersectionIntersectionIntersection"
0,我要强烈投诉，携程的接线小姐电话里说，这间酒店客人反应很好，我们才入住。谁知道入住，这里的条件如此恶劣，建议大家不要入住这家酒店。,"I want to complain strongly. The Ctrip's wiring lady said on the phone that the hotel guests responded very well and we moved in.Who knows to stay, the conditions here are so bad, it is recommended that you do not stay in this hotel."
1,作为老的四星酒店，房间依然很整洁，相当不错。机场接机服务很好，可以在车上办理入住手续，节省时间。,"As the old four -star hotel, the room is still clean and pretty good.The airport pick -up service is very good. You can check in on the car and save time."
1,"房间还算干净整洁,服务也可以,以这个价格来说,不错了,建议大家要定有窗户的房间,但是餐厅不够好,有一次吃的蘑菇是酸的,附近没有超市,不太方便,买水果都要走很远,","The room is quite clean and tidy, and the service is also available. At this price, it is good. It is recommended that you have a window with a window, but the restaurant is not good enough. Once the mushrooms you eat are sour, there is no supermarket nearby. It is not convenient. It is not very convenient.You have to go far to buy fruits,"
0,"真是可笑,入住该酒店结帐时要多付一袋开心果的费用,他们点不清自己的物品数量,出了差错,埋单的竟是消费者.请问各位:这样的地方你们敢去吗?我选择坚决不再去.如果要我给该酒店评分,我给它0分,他们的服务给客户的好感全被结帐时愚蠢的举动所抹杀.补充点评2008年4月15日：建议大家到日照时选择其他酒店,祝大家在日照开心.","It's ridiculous. When checking in the hotel, pay a bag of pistachios. They can't order their own amount of items. When they make mistakes, they are consumers who pay the bill. May I ask you: Do you dare to go like this?I chose to be resolutely no longer. If I asked me to score the hotel, I gave it 0 points, and their service to the customer was completely wiped out by the stupid move when the checkout.Choose other hotels when you go to sunshine, I wish you all a happy Rizhao."
1,这个酒店是当地最好的了，就是这样一个中小城市酒店价格不便宜，三种价格的房间其实区别不大，最便宜的就是没有地毯，木板的，最贵的只是送了两包咖啡，晚上偶尔有送花，所以自己来玩的可以住最便宜的。这个城市也就是这个酒店了。,"This hotel is the best local area. This is such a small and medium -sized city hotel price is not cheap. In fact, the three -type rooms are not very different. The cheapest is no carpet, wooden board, the most expensive is to send two packs of coffee. At nightOccasionally there are flowers, so you can play the cheapest one by yourself.This city is the hotel."
1,外观看上去像布达拉宫，里面设施一般，有点老，单纯从房间上看也就是招待所水平；但是所有人员的服务态度都很好，尤其是大堂经理（还是商务部经理？），一个济南的小伙子，态度特别好，服务非常周到，给我们在淄博的游玩出了很多好主意，非常感谢！晚上去了10楼的卡拉OK，就我和男朋友两个人，服务员还是非常周到热情，音响效果也很好，感觉十分超值（每个人才38元消费呢）！,"The appearance looks like the Potala Palace, which is a bit old, a bit old, and simply from the room, which is the level of the hostel;The guy, the attitude is particularly good, and the service is very thoughtful. He has given us a lot of good ideas in Zibo. Thank you very much!I went to the karaoke on the 10th floor in the evening. I and my boyfriend were two. The waiter was very thoughtful and enthusiastic. The sound effect was also very good. It felt very good (38 yuan per talent)!"
0,什么破4星，热水要10分钟后才来。没有中央空调。宾馆反馈2008年3月26日：没有中央空调，信息不实。热水可能白天客人洗澡的较少，管道内有一些冷水需要放净，此类事情在哪家酒店都会出现，请客人谅解！,"What breaks 4 stars, it takes 10 minutes of hot water.There is no central air conditioner.Hotel feedback on March 26, 2008: There is no central air conditioner, and the information is not true.Hot water may have fewer guests during the day. There are some cold water in the pipelines that need to be cleaned. Which hotels such things will appear, please forgive me!"
1,听说金仕顿已经是4星级了，感觉和3星没什么区别，最不能忍受的是上网问题，普通的标准间竟然还是电话线拨号上网，而且奇贵无比，只好多花点银子住了商务房，如果不是来交通厅办事，打死不会住这里，福州其他以前感觉不错的4星宾馆现在都升5星了，看来福州宾馆的水平在全国来讲算偏低水平了。还要提醒酒店的是，早餐自助餐的花样太少，每每转几圈竟然不知要吃什么。,"I heard that Kim Shidon is already a 4 -star. It feels no different from 3 stars. The most unbearable problem is the Internet. The ordinary standard room is dial -up to the Internet.Commercial housing, if it wasn't for the traffic department to do business, would not live here. The 4 -star hotels in Fuzhou who felt good before now have been rising 5 stars. It seems that the level of Fuzhou Hotel is low in the country.It is also reminded that the hotel is too small for breakfast buffets, and I do n’t know what to eat every few laps."

1,还算是不错的酒店，虽然陈旧了一些，看浦江二岸的风景也不能算全面，因为住的17楼，楼层不够高，前面正好有海鸥饭店挡着，可能得23以上才能看得全，但是起码外滩看得很全面，从外白渡桥到一直可以看到金陵路外滩方向，很美，酒店很是安静，真正的闹中取静，不错，适合度假，有家的感觉，设备因为有年代了，陈旧也是在所难免，可是房间很大，有书房，客厅，厨房，很不错的，下次要看上海最美的外滩还会来住。,"It is a good hotel. Although it is old, it is not comprehensive to see the scenery on the two banks of Pujiang, because the 17th floor where the floor is not high enough, there is exactly the seagull hotel in front, it may be more than 23 or more, but it can only be seen, but it can only be seen, butAt least the Bund is very comprehensive. From the Baidu Bridge to the direction of Jinling Road, it can be seen. It is beautiful. The hotel is very quiet.It is inevitable that Chen Chen is also unavoidable, but the room is large, there are study, living room, kitchen, very good. Next time, you will live in Shanghai's most beautiful Bund."
0,酒店环境还不错，装修也很好。早餐不怎么样，价格偏高。,"The hotel environment is not bad, and the decoration is also very good.Breakfast is not good, the price is high."
1,非常的好，宾馆里面太漂亮了，服务态度也非常好，床单很干净，去同里一定要住这里。只是美中不足的房间里的地毯陈年痕迹显得太脏了，建议能更换成地板显得干净也好打扫,"Very good, the hotel is too beautiful, the service attitude is very good, the sheets are very clean, you must live here in Tongli.But the carpet in the lack of beautiful rooms looks too dirty. It is recommended to replace the floor and look clean or clean."

1,房间很干净，酒店的服务质量相比其它酒店更有特色，对前台人员印象很深，尤其是客服人员小秦，让人如沐春风。在此向各位会员推荐木棉花酒店。宾馆反馈2008年8月15日：非常感谢你的推荐，相信有了你的支持和认可我们的工作会做的更好！！！！期待您的下次光临！！,"The room is very clean.

0,下次绝对不住！设施简陋，隔音差不说给了间公共洗手间旁边的房间，半夜饱受巨大的水管噪音折磨早上找他们干涉，个个装傻，推说值班经理不在，未果严重鄙视他们对客户不负责任的行为！补充点评2008年1月2日：忘了说一下，住的是336的酒店标准间,"I will never stop next time!The facilities are rude, and the sound insulation is not said to the room next to the public toilet. In the middle of the night, the huge water pipe noise tortured in the morning to find them to interfere in the morning.

1,我住的标准大床房，对广东大厦的印象是：优点：周围环境好；大厦的整体感觉不错；房间面积可以；房间装饰温馨；热水量大沐浴爽；电梯顺畅；接待的靓姐阿妹热情。,The standard large bed room I live in the impression of the Guangdong Building is: advantages: good surrounding environment; the overall environment of the building feels good; the room area is available; the room decoration is warm; the heat water is large; the elevator is smooth;Sister enthusiasm.
1,订的是豪华房，但是还真的挺小的。服务还可以，要求晚点退房同意的，酒店也有班车往返市中心。其实地理位置挺靠近铜锣湾地铁站的。就是后边的一片坟场，如果有忌讳就要注意了。,"The luxury room is booked, but it is really small.The service is also okay. If you ask for a check -up at a later time, the hotel also has a shuttle bus to and from the city center.In fact, the geographical location is very close to the Causeway Bay subway station.It is a cemetery behind. If you have taboos, you must pay attention."
0,令人失望的酒店。1.进入大厅，就是一股酒味，餐厅和大堂的隔离做的不好。2.电梯速度很慢，且小。不过四部电梯的配置，使等候时间缩短。3.房间设施简陋且地毯和卫生间非常肮脏，令人对整个房间的卫生程度产生怀疑。而我入住的那个房间，居然还有几个飞蛾在不停的飞，费了一番周折扑杀后才能入睡。床铺舒适度如果是经济型酒店，无可非议，但是作为四星级的酒店，是不合格的。4.入住第二天是台商会，不知那些台商住后有什么感想。而且我被告知，如果在续住，价格会涨到550。5.唯一值得肯定的是地理位置不错，风筝广场斜对面。推荐一家买风筝的，出酒店向右沿胜利东街走到大桥不到，有一家杨家埠风筝店，东西不错，也不宰客。比鸢飞斜对面的要便宜一半。,"Disappropriate hotels.1. Entering the hall is a taste of wine. The isolation of the restaurant and the lobby is not good.2. The elevator speed is very slow and small.However, the configuration of the four elevators shorten the waiting time.3. The room facilities are simple and the carpets and bathrooms are very dirty, which makes people doubt the sanitation of the entire room.And the room I stayed in, there were still a few moths flying, and it took a lot of money to fall asleep before I could fall asleep.If the bed comfort is an economical hotel, there is no advice, but as a four -star hotel, it is unqualified.4. The second day of the stay is the Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce. I do n’t know what the Taiwanese businessmen feel after the residence of Taiwanese businessmen.And I was informed that if it was renewed, the price would rise to 550.5. The only thing that deserves to be sure is that the geographical location is good and the kite square is obliquely.Recommend a kite to buy a kite, go out of the hotel to the right side of Shengli East Street to the bridge. There is a Yangjiabu kite shop.It is half cheaper than the opposite kite."
1,因为之前住过这里，房间非常非常大，所以这次又选择了这边，但是却有点失望，房间明显小很多，旧很多，厕所有很重的下水道味道，这个价钱就不值了．,"Because I have lived here before, the room is very large, so I chose this side this time, but I was a little disappointed. The room was obviously small. It was much old."
0,"敬告各位,再不要去这住了,晚上11点就关空调,上网一会有信号一会没有.早饭一般般,价格还不低,是我定过最差的宾馆补充点评2008年8月3日：最多两星,也就是过去的招待所","Target you, don't go here to live, turn off the air conditioner at 11 pm, there will be signals for a while on the Internet. The breakfast is normal, and the price is not low.Day: Most two stars, that is, the past guest house"
0,本人是在春节后2月27号入住的，该酒店很差；说是四星级，可是服务完全没有到位。我共住了五天；三天服务员进房间就是叠被子和补一次性酒店用品；地上都没有清洁过；我第一天掉的小纸屑到第三天连躺的位置都没换过；真可笑！晚上很吵，开门声音很响；实在很差；建议大家都不要去住了。,"I stayed on February 27th after the Spring Festival, and the hotel was poor; it was a four -star level, but the service was not in place.I lived in a total of five days; the three -day waiter entered the room to stack the quilt and supplement disposable hotel supplies; the ground was not cleaned on the ground; the small paper chips I dropped on the first day did not even change the position on the third day;So ridiculous!It is noisy at night, and the sound of opening the door is very loud; it is really bad; it is recommended that everyone do not live."
0,单人房紧邻锅炉房有点吵，房间里也没有桌子，，空间很狭隘，总之一般,"The single room is a bit noisy next to the boiler room, and there is no table in the room. The space is very narrow."
1,郴州第一的酒店。可惜离市区太远了，办事非常不方便。酒店的硬件相当不错，但服务员缺乏培训，对于入住和离店的手续办理速度过慢。酒店的华天食街相当方便。,"Luzhou No. 1 Hotel.Unfortunately, it is too far from the urban area, and it is very inconvenient to do things.The hotel's hardware is quite good, but the waiter lacks training, and the speed of checking in and departure is too fast.The hotel's Huatian Food Street is quite convenient."
1,宾馆大门显得很时尚，大厅很有个性，房间也保持一样的风格，绿色木纹和砖石墙面，简单不失个性，很像快捷酒店。就价位来说很值得。,"The door of the hotel looks very fashionable, the hall is very personal, and the room remains the same style. Green wood grain and masonry walls are simple and simple, and they are very similar to the fast hotel.It is worth the price."
1,酒店还比较理想，但是到餐厅就餐不太方便，如果从停车场至大堂有引导标识、客房的灯光亮一些、服务员的服务意识再强一些，可能会更好。可能是水质问题，毛巾显得乌涂涂的，不够白。,"The hotel is also ideal, but it is not convenient to eat at the restaurant. If there are guided signs from the parking lot to the lobby, the lights of the guest rooms are bright, and the serviceman's awareness of service may be better.It may be the problem of water quality. The towel looks black and not white."
1,首先，交通相对来说，非常便利，从quarrybay地铁站的c出口到酒店不超过5分钟。酒店斜对面是有轨电车，也非常方便。房间总体不错，以前印象中香港酒店的差印象有所改善。Roomservice也还可以。性价比不错，值得推荐。,"First of all, transportation is relatively convenient. It does not exceed 5 minutes from C at the Quarrybay subway station to the hotel.The hotel obliquely is a tram, which is also very convenient.The room is generally good. In the past, the poor impression of Hong Kong hotels improved.RoomService is also okay.The price / performance ratio is good, it is worth recommending."
1,我北京朋友掉了一根照相机线，但是人已经到金华，打电话到宾馆，服务人员非常敬业和负责，找到后快递到北京，在这里说声谢谢！,"My Beijing friend dropped a camera line, but people had arrived at Jinhua and called the hotel. The service staff was very dedicated and responsible."
1,"房间有免费宽带,速度很快.酒店离将军行署很近.想去参观时间又短的人可以选择这里.","There are free broadband in the room, and the speed is fast. The hotel is very close to the General Office of the General Office. Those who want to visit the short time can choose here."
1,房间很干净，设施还行，家具稍微有些旧。商务间的楼层前台不错，不过清洁工很一般，住的时间比较长，好几次都没有放新拖鞋。不过4星里他家的价位算是比较低的了。,"The room is very clean, the facilities are okay, and the furniture is slightly old.The front desk of the business room is good, but the cleaner is very average, and the time to live is relatively long. I have not put new slippers several times.However, the price of his family in 4 stars is relatively low."
1,"酒店的环境,早餐还可以。环境也比较安静，工作人员的服务意识也一流。只是酒店附近的餐饮点比较少。可供选择的不多。在酒店就餐不知为啥当时吃饭的人不多但上菜特慢。总体来说还是会继续入住该酒店。","The environment of the hotel, breakfast is okay.The environment is also relatively quiet, and the staff's awareness of service is first -rate.It's just that there are fewer catering points near the hotel.There are not many choices.I do n’t know why I did n’t eat at the hotel at the time, but there were not many people eating at the time, but the food was slow.Overall, I will continue to stay in the hotel."
0,"酒店有餐厅但只提供早餐,没有午饭和晚饭,要跑到酒店外面自己找饭店去吃,非常不方便.",There are restaurants in the hotel but only breakfast. There is no lunch and dinner. It is very inconvenient to run outside the hotel to find a restaurant to eat. It is very inconvenient.
0,"重来没碰到过态度如此之恶劣的前台.星期五晚上我们预定了4间房间,但因临时需增加1间,我们询问前台一位男服务员,他回答我们有1间,但是价格必须按散客价格460入住,我们说我们能按携程再定吗?就算个团队,但是前台告诉我们携程已经不能预定,我们问为什么,这个前台服务员居然不理睬我们,眼睛也不抬起来看我们一眼的说不行,是按规定的.而且自顾自操作我们前面预定的4间,不管我们问了几遍,照样眼睛也不抬起来看我们一眼.(而且从史自终脸一直板着,向欠他钱样的).最后惹火了我们其中几人后居然回答没有房间了,我们退而求其次问加床可以吗,居然说不可以(还没碰到宾馆不能加床的),最后只能大家挤挤住了.如此素质的人怎么能担任前台工作.后面的心情自然不言而喻.而且价格也不便宜,就是普通经济型的旅店,又没什么特色,价格比上海同等还高.要不是预定晚,别的宾馆没房间了,根本不会选择这家.补充点评2007年10月21日：另外这个酒店的配套设施简直差到极点,棋牌室居然是3个桌子放在很小的一间房间里面.而且自动麻将桌只有1个,其它设施为零,什么也没有,至于服务态度,酒店解释前台是新来的,但就是传统意义上的招待所也比他强很多!","I have not encountered the front desk with such a bad attitude. On Friday night, we scheduled 4 rooms, but because of the temporary need to add one room, we asked a male waiter in the front desk.The guest price is 460, and we said that we can set it according to Ctrip? Even if a team, the front desk tells us that Ctrip can no longer book. We ask why the front desk waiter ignores us, and we don't raise our eyes to look at us and say it.No, it is according to the regulations. And take care of the four we scheduled before, whether we asked a few times, the eyes do not lift it to see us. (And from the end of Shi Zi, I have been on the face, and I owe him.Qian -like). Finally, after getting angry, several of us actually answered that there was no room. We retired and asked if I could add beds. I said it was not possible.Everyone is squeezing. How can such a quality person work at the front desk. The mood behind it is naturally self -evident. And the price is not cheap, it is a general economy hotel, and there is no special feature. The price is higher than Shanghai.It's not that it is late, there are no rooms in other hotels, and you will not choose this house at all. Supplementary comment on October 21, 2007: In addition, the supporting facilities of this hotel are almost the extreme.In a room. And there is only one automatic mahjong table, and other facilities are zero. There is nothing. As for the service attitude, the hotel explains the front desk is new, but it is a much stronger guest house in the traditional sense than him!"
1,地点还凑合，离十字路口也就一个街区。房间比较陈旧，老式，唯一的亮点就是卫浴设备。最大的不满就是在入住的3天里光我在店的时间就停电3次，令人失望。补充点评2008年3月3日：对了，酒店提供的免费送到车站的服务十分贴心，还是比较满意的。不过这个价格在椒江还是高了，后来又去了一次住的园丁商务酒店就实惠很多。,"The location is also made up, and there is a block at the crossroads.The room is relatively old, old -fashioned, and the only highlight is bathroom equipment.The biggest dissatisfaction was that I had stopped power at 3 days in the store, which was disappointing.Supplementary comment on March 3, 2008: By the way, the free service provided by the hotel to the station is very intimate and more satisfactory.However, this price was still high in Jiaojiang. Later, the gardener business hotel where I lived again was much affordable."
1,"酒店是国航酒店,入住可以累计国航里程.这点比较好.早晨种类很多,推荐入住","The hotel is the Air China Hotel, which can cumulative Air China mileage in check -in. This is better. There are many types in the morning, and it is recommended to check in"
1,1、上网速度不错，很流畅2、早餐品种太少，但是有现煮的面条、米线等，还可以，油条非常难吃3、没有送水果4、床很大很舒服,"1. The Internet speed is good, very smooth 2. There are too few breakfast varieties, but there are currently cooked noodles, rice noodles, etc. Okay, the fritters are very unpalatable. 3. No fruit is given. 4. The bed is very large and comfortable."
1,总体感觉还不错，前台服务很好，酒店里面床单更换是有选择的，一张单子你放正面就换床单，另外一面就不换，其他设施都还不错啦，能够想到的工具都有的，感觉冰箱好像小了点儿，而且装上酒店那些饮料之后自己要放东西就没多大空间了，希望有改进啦。还有就是酒店正面是黑牛城道，会比较吵，反面比较安静总体来说还算不错！,"Overall feels good. The front desk service is very good. The sheets in the hotel are available. If you put a list, you can change the sheets on the front.I feel that the refrigerator seems to be a little small, and there is no room for putting things on the hotel to put things on the hotel. I hope there is improvement.There is also the front of the hotel is Black Niucheng Road. It will be more noisy."
1,我们是2007年7月7日入住的。五一参加了“亲亲家庭总动员”自驾游入住两晚送一晚的活动。所以这次入住用的是免费住房券。入住时要交200元押金，我要求用信用卡支付，前台服务人员告知我如果无任何消费，预授权要两至三周才能取消。我觉得很奇怪，我在其它酒店也曾试过无任何消费，第二天刷卡授权取消（房费已提前在网上支付了）。前台服务人员一直要我付现金，在我的再三坚持下很不情愿才刷卡的（感觉很不爽），并一再强调酒店的刷卡机如果当天的预授权，当天取消就可以，（这不是废话吗，我总不能当天入住当天就退房吧）要不就得等酒店财务部门两三周后通知银行才能取消授权。我想该不会是银行的系统问题吧，我在别的酒店还从来没有碰到这种问题。希望你们尽快与银行方面协调解决这个问题。截至目前为止，我那200元预授权还没有被取消。,"We stayed on July 7, 2007.May 1st participated in the ""Kiss Family Story"" to travel for two nights for two nights.So this time you use free housing vouchers.I have to pay a deposit of 200 yuan when I check in. I ask for a credit card to pay. The front desk service staff told me that if there is no consumption, it takes two to three weeks to be canceled.I find it strange that I have tried no consumption in other hotels, and the card authorization is canceled the next day (the housing fee has been paid online in advance).The service staff at the front desk has always asked me to pay cash. Under my repeated persistence, I was reluctant to swipe the card (I felt uncomfortable), and repeatedly emphasized that the hotel's credit card machine would be canceled on the same day. (Isn't this nonsense?I can't check out on the day of staying on the same day.) Don't wait for the hotel financial department to notify the bank to cancel the authorization after two or three weeks.I think it should not be a bank's system problem. I never encountered such a problem in other hotels.I hope you will coordinate this problem with banks as soon as possible.So far, the pre -authorization of my 200 yuan has not been canceled."
0,"对该酒店不是很满意.预定入住2天.结果入住当日查询无客人姓名.通过协成沟通没问题了以后..再CHECKOUT那天收到协程短信说预定只为一天,另一天客人已退房,这完全是该酒店对协程的欺骗.很没好感.","I am not very satisfied with the hotel. State for 2 days. As a result, check the name without guests on the day of check -in. After the communication is okay, there is no problem .. CHECKOUT received a text message that day and said that it was scheduled to be just one day. On the other day, the guests had left the house.This is completely the hotel's deception of the coroutine. I don't like it."
0,招待所而已吧，唯一可取之处就是交通还行，三环边上。,"The only one can be taken, the only thing that can be taken is that the traffic is okay, and the three rings are on the side."
1,4月8日订了两个房型，一个单间和一个标间加床。房间很大，加了床还很空旷。里面有个麻将桌，可惜我们凌晨两点才回到酒店，倒头就睡了。床上用品不够星级标准，相当于经济型酒店，枕头太软了！早饭很丰盛，太好了！宾馆反馈2008年4月11日：非常感谢您的宝贵意见和对我们的肯定，做的好的我们会继续努力，对于您不满意的地方我们会积极配合整改，真诚期待您的再次光临，给我们一个提供更好服务的机会！,"Two room types were booked on April 8th, a single room and a standard room.The room was large, and the bed was still empty.There is a mahjong table in it, but unfortunately we returned to the hotel at two in the morning and fell asleep.The bedding is not enough for star -rated standards, which is equivalent to economical hotels. The pillows are too soft!Breakfast is rich and great!Hotel feedback on April 11, 2008: Thank you very much for your valuable opinions and affirmation of us. We will continue to work hard.

0,房间装修陈旧，下水管堵塞，晚上折腾了2个多小时，还是没有修好。,"The room decoration was old, and the sewer pipe was blocked. It tossed for more than 2 hours at night, but it was still not repaired."
1,这家酒店感觉达不到五星，应该处在四星的水平。客房勉强还可以，但早餐做的不好，品种也少，跟同事住这里，基本上是吃了几口就走了。,"This hotel feels less than five stars and should be at the level of four -star.The rooms are barely okay, but the breakfast is not good, and there are few varieties. Living with colleagues here basically take a few mouthfuls and leave."
1,第二次入住这家酒店，还是感觉挺干净的，就是因为房间太小，晚上有点闷，网速也非常慢，早餐一般，没什么吃的。,"The second time I stayed in this hotel, I still felt very clean, because the room was too small, it was a bit stuffy at night, and the speed of the network was very slow."

0,毫无一家酒店应该具备的任何条件可谈。我是2007年12月29日晚入住的，入住时间是将近30日0点。1、刚推开房门就被一股恶臭击倒；2、进了房间感觉比在大街上还冷，问了前台才被告知房间里没有暖气，只能靠一部开启后半个多小时以后才出热风的空调取暖；3、淋浴从我进入房间就开始打开放热水，放了一个小时未见变热；4、饮水的杯子里面全是茶垢；5、床垫硌人，被子超薄；6、服务意识超差，吸烟房不提供火柴，找客房中心，被告知只能自己去一楼前台处购买2元一个的打火机……总的来说，这家酒店无论从硬件还是软件都不具备作为一家酒店而存在的根本条件。我是天津本地人，但我从来不了解天津的酒店水平竟然如此之差。因为工作的关系，我曾经在全国几十个城市住过上百家酒店，但在我的家乡，真的被这家酒店弄得失望之极！,"None of the hotels should have any conditions to talk about.I stayed on the evening of December 29, 2007, and the staying time was nearly 30 days.1. As soon as the door was opened, it was knocked down by a stench; 2. I felt colder when I entered the room than on the street. I asked the front desk and was told that there was no heating in the room.In the future, the air -conditioning of the hot air is heated; 3. The shower starts to open the hot water from my entering the room, and it has not seen heat for an hour; 4. The cups of drinking water are full of tea dirt;Super thin; 6. The service awareness is super poor, and the smoking room does not provide a match. Find a guest room center. I was told that I could only go to the front desk on the first floor to buy a lighter of 2 yuan ... In general, this hotel isThe software does not have the fundamental condition that exists as a hotel.I am a native of Tianjin, but I never understand that the level of the hotel in Tianjin is so bad.Because of the work, I have lived in hundreds of hotels in dozens of cities across the country, but in my hometown, I was really disappointed by this hotel!"
1,里阳澄湖渔家灯火较近，去就餐较方便。酒店早餐不是很丰富，房间设施尚可，标准房无矿泉水送。,"The fishery home of Liyang Chenghu is relatively close, and it is more convenient to eat.The hotel breakfast is not very rich, the room facilities are acceptable, and the standard room has no mineral water."
1,和父母一起去的，所以住在家庭房里，没有看到无敌江景。总得来说，酒店弄得比较干净。韩国人特别多。但是房间里老是有一股去不了的怪味道，马桶偶尔漏漏水，莲蓬头设计得非常容易往外溅水。早餐也不咋地。虽然缺点多多，但是已经算是丹东最顶尖的酒店了。,"I went with my parents, so I lived in the family room and did not see the invincible river view.In general, the hotel is relatively clean.There are so many Koreans.However, there is always a strange smell in the room. The toilet is occasionally leaked, and the shower head is very easy to splash water.Breakfast is not good.Although there are many shortcomings, it is already the top hotel in Dandong."
0,房间非常糟糕，零乱不堪，弥漫一阵腐霉气味，家具极其陈旧，地毯脏臭，冷热水不能调，龙头漏水，灯罩不翼而飞，不可想象居然还挂着三星的标志。有些酒店虽然营业时间久远，但维护得好，仍然可以入住。但此酒店简直象无人管理一样，破败不堪，非人可住的，与网站介绍完全不是一回事情。希望携程把好协议酒店的关，不能让此类酒店误导客户。,"The room was very bad, chaotic, permeated for a while, the furniture was extremely old, the carpet was dirty, the hot and cold water could not be adjusted, the faucet leaked, the lampshade was missing, and the Samsung logo was still hung.Although some hotels have a long business time, they can still stay in.However, this hotel is just like no one managed. It is ruined. It is not the same as the website introduction.I hope that Ctrip will have the level of good agreement hotels, and such hotels will not be misleading customers."
0,"环境差得很.进房间就一股丑味.设施简陋,电视不清楚,最重要的是房间价格,自己到店大堂可以还价,价格比携程价还要低,携程210的到店里可以还到180.",The environment is very poor. It is ugly in the room. The facilities are simple and the TV is unclear. The most important thing is the price of the room. It can be repaid by the lobby of the store. The price is lower than the port price.Also to 180.
1,酒店的交通不很方便，电梯特别慢，其余还是如家特色。,"The transportation of the hotel is not very convenient, the elevator is particularly slow, and the rest is still the characteristics of the family."
1,本人于3月29日入住自己住一房一的朋友住房一依算不房很大缺是停再就是水器置在室然有制排是有煤味道清程度很好一有免咖啡真的不下次我是考住,"I stayed at my friends who lived in one room on March 29 and the house was a big house. There was a big lack of a non -house. Then, the water heater was in the room. There was a town in the room.No next time I will take the test"
1,酒店总体来说还好。房间比较宽敞，但是说是4星，大概应该只有3星。没有一次性拖鞋比较郁闷。早餐不错，比较满意。交通非常方便，但是酒店外面的出租车最好别坐，太黑人。我们被拉到一家超级无敌宰客的地方吃海鲜，晕啊，三叠菜，500块，滴血。。。出门旅游，捂好荷包啊！,"The hotel is generally okay.The room is relatively spacious, but it is 4 stars, probably only 3 stars.No disposable slippers are more depressed.Breakfast is good and more satisfied.The transportation is very convenient, but the taxi outside the hotel is best not to sit, too black.We were pulled to a super invincible place to eat seafood, dizzy, three stacked dishes, 500 pieces, and blood.EssenceEssenceGo out to travel, cover the lotus bag!"
1,地处闹市区，出门倒是方便。早餐还物有所值，咖啡厅会客方便（人不太多）。房间隔音不太好，影响休息。停车位太少，向大堂经理反映后，才给了保留车位。没办法，这已经是当地最好的酒店了。,"It is located in the downtown area, and it is convenient to go out.Breakfast is worthwhile, the cafe is convenient for guests (not too many people).The sound sound sound is not very good, affecting rest.There are too few parking spaces. After reporting to the lobby manager, the parking space was reserved.No way, this is the best local hotel."
1,12/29-31住标准大床房，房价170元。今天住商务大床房，房价189元。房间是大一倍。要选这家酒店的话，一定要选商务大床房。只有贵19元/天，相差很大。,"12/29-31 Living in a standard large bed, house price is 170 yuan.Today, I live in a large business bed, and house prices are 189 yuan.The room is doubled.If you want to choose this hotel, you must choose a large business bed.Only 19 yuan/day, the difference is very large."
1,我一直很信赖携程，入住红墙七天，房价和饭店设施总体不错，房间虽然小点，但装修很好，特别是店内员工服务很是热情，就是打的麻烦些，提醒各位千万别让门童服务生订车，真黑，联系包车八小时内天安门附近游，收我800元，问司机才给600元，第二天我直接联系车主省下200元，,"I have always trusted Ctrip. I stayed in the Red Wall for seven days. House prices and hotel facilities were generally good. Although the room was small, the decoration was very good. In particular, the employee service in the store was very enthusiastic.The children's waiter booked a car, really black, contact the chartered car near Tiananmen to travel near Tiananmen, collect me 800 yuan, and ask the driver to give 600 yuan. The next day I will directly contact the owner to save 200 yuan."
0,这是我住过酒店最糟糕的一次，首先是入住房间弄错了，和别人的房间重复了，接着是晚上睡觉半夜2点还在吵，无法入睡，多次电话前台均没有得到解决，最要命的是热水竟然没有，本来还要住5天的，实在无法接受，房间没有窗户就算了，还这么多问题，住了一晚上直接退房，改住旁边的7天酒店了！非常失望，住到这样的酒店！,"This is the worst one I have lived in the hotel. First of all, the room in the room was wrong, and the rooms of others were repeated. Then I was noisy at 2 o'clock in the middle of the night at night. I couldn't sleep.The terrible is that the hot water did not have it. I had to live for 5 days. It was really unacceptable. There were no windows in the room. There were so many problems. I stayed directly for one night and changed to the 7 -day hotel next to the hotel!Very disappointed, stay in such a hotel!"
0,"位置很好,房间和设施很旧.服务1*.结帐时还经历前台服务员凶客人.补充点评2007年12月9日：携程为什么不把对面的香格里拉发展为伙伴呢?下次去住香格里拉,可能要通过亿龙网定了.","The location is very good, the room and facilities are very old. Service 1*. At the checkout, I also experienced the fierce guest of the front desk waiter. Supplementary comment on December 9, 2007: Why does Ctrip not develop the opposite Shangri -La into a partner? Next time I live in Shangri -LaIt may be determined through Yilong.com."
0,"订的阳光的豪华行政房，居然比同事订的豪华房小很多，要不是正巧去同事那边去看看，就让酒过去了。2种房间的价格差了￥150，贵的房间除了面积小了许多-甚至还不如普通标房大，其他设施无任何变化！这种变相斩客的做法是对消费者的欺诈！酒店的行政楼层无人员值班，也无任何行政客人的专项服务：无行政酒廊，无Happyhour,无专人服务。","The luxurious administrative house ordered the sunny manner is much smaller than the luxury room ordered by colleagues. If it happened to happen to see the colleagues, let the wine pass.The price of the two rooms is ￥ 150, and the expensive room is much smaller than the area-not even as large as ordinary standard rooms, and other facilities have not changed!This disguise is a fraud to consumers!The hotel's administrative floor has no personnel on duty, nor the special services of any administrative guests: no administrative lounge, no Happy Hour, no special person service."
0,之前我点评过一次，估计是没有写证据，所以被携程删除了，气愤！补充点评2008年5月26日：我补上我的经历：1，正如很多入住的朋友说的一样，门童和死尸一样，见到客人拿的行李就视而不见，还故意扭过头去装作没有看见。2，酒店没有任何指引服务，感觉还不如如家的服务员素质高3，携程上写的有欢迎水果，居然是服务生拿着文件夹夹着2个路边摊上买来的低档苹果，价格绝对不会超过2元每公斤！没想到锦江五星级的欢迎水果就是这种档次，真是丢人4，找大堂经理交涉，居然说就是这样，还说第二次来才会好一点，不知道这个大堂经理是不是脑子坏掉了，没有好的服务怎么吸引客人来第二次5，整个入住的过程中没有看到服务员微笑，不知道是不是大家都沉浸在地震灾难带来的痛苦之中。6，总之以后都不会住这个酒店了，不要钱免费住也不去了。,"I have reviewed it once before. I guess I did not write evidence, so I was deleted by Ctrip, angry!Supplementary comment on May 26, 2008: I make up for my experience: 1. As many friends who stay in, the door children, as the dead corpse, see the luggage taken by the guests, and then deliberately turn their heads to pretend not to pretend not to pretend that there is no no waysee.2. The hotel has no guidance service. It feels like the quality of the waiter who is home is high. 3. Ctrip has welcome fruits. It is actually a waiter holding a folder with a low -end apple bought on the roadside stall. The price is definitely the price.It will not exceed 2 yuan per kilogram!I did not expect that the five -star welcome fruit of Jinjiang is this kind of grade. It is really shameful. I asked the lobby manager to negotiate. It was said that it would be better.There is no good service to attract guests for the second time. During the entire process of check -in, I didn't see the waiter's smile. I don't know if everyone was immersed in the pain caused by the earthquake disaster.6. In short, I won't live in this hotel in the future. Don't stay for free."
1,房间设施都好，尤其是豪华房内浴缸的上方还有镶在墙里面的电视很难得。,"The room facilities are good, especially the upper above the bathtub in the luxury room is rare."
1,"地理位置很方便,就是紧挨着火车站,有点闹心.房间的配置还看的过去,比四星差点,比三星强点.亮点是卫生间有可以直接饮用的水龙头.","The geographical location is very convenient, that is, next to the railway station, it is a bit troubled. The configuration of the room is still in the past. It is more than four stars. It is stronger than Samsung. The highlight is that the bathroom has a faucet that can be directly consumed."
1,酒店非常赞.性价比极高!下次还会继续选择.,The hotel is very good. The cost -effectiveness is very high! I will continue to choose next time.
0,4月25日，经携程预订，入住四川宾馆西楼。到达后前台的服务员说查不到有预订，但是依然顺利地办理了入住，因为前台的价格跟携程的价格是一样的。这个宾馆不太好找，四川宾馆分主楼，南楼，西楼，三个楼相距甚远，出租车绕了半天才找到。之所以选择这里，是因为在网上看大家评价还比较高，而且说比较安静，离商业区又近。可是晚上问题来了，我的房间是临街的，楼下有一群人在夜市喝酒，房间的玻璃严重不隔音，一直吵到三点才作罢，睡得很不好。第二日去峨嵋山，27日返回，依然打算住这里，因为房间的设施还算是比较干净的。特意跟前台强调要一间朝里的安静的房间，可是没想到，新的更大的问题又出现了，房间外有空调或是锅炉的轰鸣声，吵得人耳朵极不舒服，更不用说睡觉了。忍受到十二点，打电话去前台询问，后被告知是空调的声音，但是本酒店的空调已经关了，而旁边另一家酒店的空调机依然在响，他们也没办法。主动提出给换一间房，没办法，只好把摊开的东西一一收拾，再换到临街的一个房间。这次倒还好，楼下没有人吵闹，可是卫生间返味儿，满屋子都是一股臭味儿，实在不想再折腾了，把妈妈带着的香皂放在床头，稍微抵挡一下。唉，总之，这次川宾西楼住的很不舒服，一号返回到成都还需要再住两日，这次绝对不能再接着住了，换宾馆！,"On April 25, through Ctrip's booking, he stayed at the West Tower of Sichuan Hotel.The waiter who arrived at the background said that he could not find a booking, but he still went to check in smoothly, because the price of the front desk was the same as the price of Ctrip.This hotel is not easy to find. The Sichuan Hotel is divided into the main building, the south building, the west building, and the three buildings are far apart.The reason for choosing here is that everyone's evaluation is relatively high on the Internet, and it is relatively quiet and close to the business district.However, the problem came at night. My room was facing the street. There was a group of people drinking downstairs in the night market. The glass in the room was severely soundproof. It was noisy until three o'clock before he stopped.On the second day, I went to Mount Emei and returned on the 27th. I still planned to live here, because the facilities in the room were relatively clean.I specially emphasized a quiet room in the front desk, but I did not expect that the new greater problem appeared again. There was an air conditioner or a roar of the boiler outside the room.It's right.At the twelve o'clock, I called to the front desk to ask, and was told that it was the sound of the air conditioner, but the air conditioner of this hotel was turned off, and the air conditioner of the other hotel next to it was still rang, and they couldn't help it.I took the initiative to change a room. There was no way, so I had to clean up the spreading things one by one, and then changed to a room on the street.This time it was okay. No one was noisy downstairs, but the bathroom returned to the taste. The room was full of smell. I really didn't want to toss anymore. Put the soap taken by my mother on the bedside and resist it a little.Alas, in short, this time I lived in the west of Sichuan Binbin. I still need to live for another two days when I return to Chengdu. This time, I can never stay. Change the hotel!"
1,"环境和房间还可以,价格有点贵(鄂尔多斯唯一的5星吗),房间地毯有点脏,并且没有其它酒店常备的一般文具,西早还可以,但味道一般.有一个西餐厅和一个中餐厅,西餐厅因客人很少,所以价格较贵,味道很差.最头疼是打车,需提前15分于礼宾部预订,如用酒店的车价格贵(比出租车贵3-5倍)不说,还需在8:30-17:30才有短途的可用.总之如住的时间短还不如住在离4公里远的罗丽尔大酒店,虽无星级但便宜(标房120元)用餐和打的都方便,但设施一般.","The environment and rooms are okay. The price is a bit expensive (the only 5 star in Ordos), the carpet of the room is a bit dirty, and there is no general stationery prepared by other hotels.Because there are very few guests in Western restaurants, the price is more expensive and the taste is very poor. The most headache is a taxi. It needs to be reserved at the Li Bin Department 15 in advance.It still needs to be short-distance available at 8: 30-17: 30. In short, it is better to stay at the Reliel Hotel 4 kilometers away from it.It is convenient to fight, but the facilities are average."
1,很好．非常干净．是新装修的．服务不错．早餐也很好．对了，被子很厚但非常松软．哈哈满意,"very good.Very clean.It's new.Good service.Breakfast is also very good.By the way, the quilt is very thick but very soft.Haha satisfied"
1,开始定的大床房，进去一看一个人睡都觉得小。无奈升级到双床，700多的价格实在没什么吸引力。不过房间还是不错的，卫生间也很大。整个院子里环境很好。前台的小姐和礼宾部都特别热情。就是订餐部的人态度不好，定了批萨说美居没有番茄酱什么的，说了半天给送了一小包。最难以接受的就是索菲特的巧克力屋，早上9点出去玩儿前问前台，前台说10点开，查了一下房间的案内也说早10点到晚10点，晚上没吃晚饭9点半特意又去买，结果那里的小姐说关门了，什么都没了。我说不是10点关吗，她说改9点了。这个大的酒店，关门时间说改就改，挺难接受的。后来跟大堂经理反映，态度还不错，但还是很扫兴。整体环境还是不错的，下次还会住。,"Start the big bed room, and when you go in and see a person sleeping alone.Helplessly upgraded to double bed, the price of more than 700 is really not attractive.However, the room is still good and the bathroom is very large.The environment in the entire yard is very good.The ladies and Libin Department of the front desk are very enthusiastic.That is, the person in the ordering department is not good. He set the batch of Sa Sa says that there is no tomato sauce or something. He said it for a long time to give a small bag.The most difficult to accept is Sofit's chocolate house. When you go out at 9 in the morning to play, ask the front desk. The front desk is said at 10 o'clock. After checking the case in the room, it also said that from 10 am to 10 pm.I went to buy it again. As a result, the lady there said that they had closed the door and had nothing.I said it was not at 10 o'clock, she said that it was changed at 9 o'clock.This big hotel, when the door is closed, it is difficult to accept.Later, the lobby manager reported that his attitude was good, but he was still very disappointed.The overall environment is still good, I will live next time."
1,整体感觉还不错，早餐一般。住行政楼层，问前台最晚几点退房，第一个答复是中午12点。我说有看到网友留言说是到下午2点，答复是如果需要可以保留到1点钟，哈。,"The overall feels good, breakfast is average.Living in the administrative floor, ask the at the latest out of the front desk to check out, the first answer is 12 noon.I said that I saw a message from netizens that it was 2 pm, and the answer was that if you need to keep it to 1 o'clock, ha."
0,看到门口的样子，就知道不是真正的凯莱了，门厅零落要的商务房，对马路，跟没有玻璃一样，晚上吵闹，非常不隔音早餐特别乱，就豆浆可以喝喝,"Seeing the appearance at the door, I know that it is not the real Kaile. The business houses that are scattered in the foyer are like the road, like no glass, noisy at night, very messy breakfast at night, so soy milk can drink and drink."
1,酒店的整体状况保持了万丽的一贯水准。非常不错。希望：如果对国人和外宾的态度一致就更加好了。似乎外宾容易受到较好的待遇，比如升级等服务。行政酒廊似乎对国人客人的警惕性较高。比如国人一进入就会被询问房间号码，而老外客人是要到实际饮用时才被询问。,"The overall situation of the hotel maintains the consistent level of Wanli.very good.Hope: If the attitude of Chinese and foreign guests is even better.It seems that foreign guests are vulnerable to better treatment, such as upgrading and other services.The administrative lounge seems to be more vigilant for Chinese and guests.For example, when the Chinese people enter, they will be asked about the room number, and foreigners and guests will not be asked when they are actually drinking."
1,再次入住该酒店，不过这次入住的是标准房，在4楼。房间的设施其实和豪华房是一样的，只不过因为3楼是夜总会，晚上有点吵，而且外面走廊的地毯有点脏。另外，早餐还是和上次入住一样，10点多一点就很多东西都没有啦，而且那天还是星期天。,"Check in the hotel again, but this time I stayed in the standard room, on the 4th floor.The facilities in the room are actually the same as the luxury room, but because the third floor is the nightclub, it is a bit noisy at night, and the carpet on the outside corridor is a bit dirty.In addition, breakfast is the same as last time, and there are no things at 10 o'clock at 10 o'clock, and it was Sunday that day."
1,进入房间后，发现床什么都是理好的，牙刷什么也不缺，但是居然有用过的牙刷，而且还是浸在装满水的杯子里，还有双穿过的鞋子。晕，这算清理过房间还是没有。不过服务态度蛮好，我说要换间房，马上给我安排了。另外，我用工行卡，前台居然说工行卡授权取消什么很麻烦，最后我是用卡刷了房费再加上现金押金的，这个应该改进。不过总体上，还可以。,"After entering the room, I found that the bed was rational and the toothbrush was not missing, but there were actually used toothbrushes, and it was still immersed in the water filled with water, and there were double -passing shoes.Halo, this is still clean to clean up the room.However, the service attitude is quite good. I said that I would change the room and immediately arranged for me.In addition, I used the ICBC card, and the front desk actually said that the ICBC card authorization was troublesome. In the end, I used the card to swipe the house fee and the cash deposit. This should be improved.But in general, it is okay."
1,入住过几次，房间还是不错的。但是早餐质量是江河日下，一次不如一次。,"After checking in several times, the room is still good.But the quality of breakfast is under rivers and rivers, it is better to once."
1,酒店整体不错，服务也可以，不过没有瓶装水送客人喝，哪里的水烧开了都感觉不能喝。送来的水果没吃完，第二天服务员就收走了，没有报纸，电视节目也不够多，希望能改进。,"The hotel is good as a whole, and the service is okay, but there is no bottle of water to send the guests to drink.The fruits sent were not finished, and the waiter took away the next day. There was no newspaper, and there were not enough TV shows. I hope to improve it."
0,房间设施比较简单。服务员服务也一般，隔音比较差。晚上的骚扰电话，唉，不提了,"The room facilities are relatively simple.The waiter's service is also average, and the sound insulation is poor.The harassment call at night, alas, don’t mention it"
1,"第二次入住了,感觉还是挺好，早餐下来到一楼餐厅的门早上能开就更好了。","The second time I stayed, I felt pretty good. It would be better to go to the door of the restaurant on the first floor on the first floor."
1,"早餐很好,位置算不错,打车到火车站要十几员吧","The breakfast is very good, the location is good, take a taxi to the train station for more than a dozen members."
1,再次感谢紫霞山庄带给我们美好的时光。其实越王山还是很漂亮的，就是喜欢那种幽静的生活。,"Thank you Zixia Villa again for bringing us a good time.In fact, Yue Wangshan is still very beautiful, just like the quiet life."
0,实在不建议大家住在那里，如果你自己没有车的话，价格贵，位置差，我第一次遇上连车都不帮你叫的酒店。竟然让客人自己提着大箱子走上20分钟去打黑车。这是我遇上的最差的酒店。如果有零分第一个打给它。,"It is really not recommended that everyone live there. If you do n’t have a car, the price is expensive, and the location is poor. For the first time, I encountered a hotel that I didn't even help you.It turned out that the guests took a large box and took 20 minutes to get a black car.This is the worst hotel I encountered.If there is zero points, the first one is given to it."
1,地方还可以房间有点脏我住的是B212但还行就是卧室里没电视不爽其他还可以早餐没时间吃这个地段这个价格算可以,The place can still be a bit dirty. I live in B212 but still OK is that there is no TV in the bedroom.
1,房间很新，入住的是行政房，窗外望出去就是玄武湖。窗台上的大理石颜色和我家的一样，给我一种很温馨的感觉。唯一搞不懂的是卫生间的橱和房间的衣橱是同一个，可以互通。交通方便，从火车站上地铁到鼓楼站下，步行5-8分钟便可到。总体感觉不错。,"The room is very new. The administrative house is staying in, and it is Xuanwu Lake looking out of the window.The marble color on the window sill is the same as my family, giving me a very warm feeling.The only thing that I do n’t understand is that the wardrobe in the bathroom and the wardrobe of the room are the same, which can be communicated.The transportation is convenient. From the train station to the subway to the Drum Tower Station, walk for 5-8 minutes.Overall feels good."
1,酒店地段尚可，离火车站和沃尔玛超市比较近（需要打车），大厅和前面的停车场都比较宽畅。房间里设施也不错，不足之错有三点：一、网络不稳定，好几个房间上不了网，网线和插口很破旧，偶尔会断线。二、大厅小卖部铁将军把门，想买点东西需要去外面买。三、餐厅提供的经济套餐名不符实，25元的套餐跟外面卖5块钱的差不多！宾馆反馈2008年3月27日：尊敬的客户：您好！感谢你对金城大酒店的支持，对于你反映的三个问题我们已经反馈到酒店相关部门。谢谢！,"The hotel is still available, which is closer to the railway station and Wal -Mart supermarket (need to take a taxi). The hall and the front parking lot are relatively wide.The facilities in the room are also good, there are three points of lack of faults: 1. The network is unstable, several rooms cannot be available on the network, the network cable and the socket are very worn, and occasionally break the line.Second, the lobby sellers of the iron general's door, you need to go outside to buy something.3. The name of the economic package provided by the restaurant is not true. The set meal of 25 yuan is similar to 5 yuan selling outside!Hotel feedback on March 27, 2008: Dear customer: Hello!Thank you for your support to Jinsheng Hotel, we have fed back to the hotel -related departments for the three issues you reflected.Thanks!"
1,除了价格和前台服务外，其他都很满意！房间很大，浴室也很别致，也不是很吵！而且很贴心的是在创旁和沙发旁都有网线的插口！,"Except for the price and the front desk service, everything else is very satisfied!The room is large, the bathroom is very chic, and it is not very noisy!And it is very intimate, there are network cables with network cables next to the innovation and sofa!"
1,"温泉还是不错的,其它很一般了.卫生间小且旧.景区的宾馆也就这样了.","The hot spring is still good, the others are very general. The bathroom is small and old. The hotel in the scenic area is the same."
1,酒店房间很好，闯很大，不是一般大！总体来说不错，唯一美中不足的是早餐还没到十点服务员就来收牌子，令到来晚一点的住客都不知道有什么吃的。,"The hotel room is very good, it is very large, not a large!Generally speaking, the only disadvantage is that before the breakfast is at 10 o'clock, they will receive the cards, so that the residents who come later do not know what to eat."
1,"总体还行，在景区边,环境和空气都是不错的，不过我们去的时候还在改建(好象去年就的扩建了，怎么这么长时间啊)，环境就打了折扣了。我们住的丽景楼三楼顶头好象是319室，窗口对的不知是什么机房，有嗡嗡声，影响休息，与服务台反映后换了房间。餐厅菜的品种少，味道一般。等改建好了后，应该是个不错的住地。","Overall, the environment and air are good at the scenic area, but when we go, we are still being rebuilt (as if it has been expanded last year, why is it so long) and the environment is discounted.The top of the top floor of Linglou we lived seemed to be Room 319. The window was right. I do n’t know what kind of computer room. There was a buzzing sound to affect the rest. After the room was reflected, we changed the room.There are few varieties of restaurant dishes and average taste.After the reconstruction is completed, it should be a good place to live."
1,"住的是350的大床房,以四星标准衡量的话,家具太旧,房间太小,早餐品种单一,别的总体来说还可以吧,地段不错,服务也满好.","I live in a 350 large bed room. If it is measured by four -star standards, the furniture is too old, the room is too small, and the breakfast variety is single. Overall it is okay, the location is good, the service is full."
1,"环境和地理位置很好,房间有点旧,浴室也比较简单,出门TAXI不方便.这次公务,要是去旅游还是住那里.","The environment and geographical location are very good, the room is a bit old, and the bathroom is relatively simple. It is inconvenient to go out. This time, if you go to travel, you still live."
1,酒店位置不错，距离海边风景区非常近。院内环境较好。缺点就是房间设施相对较陈旧。酒店用品显得有点旧。总体感觉还是不错的。,"The hotel location is good, which is very close to the seaside scenic area.The environment in the courtyard is better.The disadvantage is that the room facilities are relatively old.Hotel supplies look a bit old.Overall feels good."
1,服务相当不错，还提供免费机场接送。早餐很丰盛，硬件稍显老。下次还会再住,"The service is pretty good, and there are also free airport pickups.Breakfast is rich, and the hardware is slightly old.I will live again next time"
1,环境很不错，房间也较大，干净、整洁、舒适，性价比较高。checkin虽然排队较长，但也较快。酒店自助餐厅营业时间到晚11时，而不是前台说的到晚12点。我们差点没吃上饭。,"The environment is very good, the room is also large, clean, tidy, comfortable, and cost -effective.Although Checkin lined up for a long time, it was faster.The hotel buffet restaurant is open at 11:00 pm, not at the front desk until 12pm.We almost didn't eat."
1,酒店环境、设施不错，空间比较大，有液晶电视，这个价格在香港应该还算不错的。交通也还算方便，bus比较方便，不过离地铁好像比较远。不过在香港如果5个人拼出租车是很算的（香港的出租车可以坐5个人）。周边也比较热闹。不错的选择。,"The hotel environment and facilities are good, the space is relatively large, and there are LCD TVs. This price should be pretty good in Hong Kong.Transportation is also convenient, BUS is more convenient, but it seems far from the subway.However, if 5 people fight for taxis in Hong Kong, it is very calculated (a taxi in Hong Kong can take 5 people).The surroundings are also more lively.Good choice."
0,总台冷冰冰，酒店冷清清。性价比不高，价格偏贵，不如住嘉利。,"The main station is cold, and the hotel is cold.The price / performance ratio is not high, the price is expensive, it is better to live in Jiali."
1,"酒店服务很不错。有几次因标准房间售完，酒店就升级到豪华间宾馆反馈2008年7月3日：感谢您经常入住国宾大酒店,并且对酒店的服务予以认可.我们热切期待您的再次光临!","The hotel service is very good.Several times, the hotel has been upgraded to the luxury room in the luxury room for feedback on July 3, 2008: Thank you for staying at the Guobin Hotel, and recognize the service of the hotel. We are eagerly looking forward to your visit again!"
1,环境很不错，酒店的园林很大，很安静，也很漂亮。只是酒店的服务生清理房间的速度较慢，微笑地主动向客人问好不够。,"The environment is very good, the hotel's garden is very large, quiet, and beautiful.It's just that the hotel's waiter cleans the room slowly, and ask the guests with a smile."
1,还算不错的一家酒店公寓。但是以688元的价格来说有点不值了。房间的门厅和客厅是地砖，不是很舒服，比较凉，而且作为公寓比酒店大一点有限。西门子的洗衣机不错，带烘干功能，因为房间里没有晾衣服的空间，所以烘干功能很重要。厨房基本上是摆设，除了热水器和一个咖啡壶，什么也没有，要做饭还要再向前台借锅和碗。而且这么贵的价格居然不含上网费用。前台的服务还不错，有问必答，态度和善。以前住过静安御庭国际公寓，700多元的两室两厅两卫一厨，深色木地板大沙发很舒服，很适合两家人游玩时居住或者有小孩的家庭商旅居住，厨房一应俱全，床也很舒服，大大的羽绒被。相较之下帝景苑酒店公寓的价格和设施就显得不值了。要施携程能拿下更低些的价格会更有吸引力。还是那句话，总的来说应该还不错，就是价格太高了，这个规模这个设施，价位<500元比较合理。补充点评2008年4月10日：哦对了，酒店电梯要用卡来启动比较令客人有安全感。评为3星有些冤，4星硬件又不够，我觉得3.5星比较合适。,"A good hotel apartment.But at a price of 688 yuan, it is a bit worthless.The room and living room of the room are floor tiles. They are not very comfortable and cooler, and they are a little larger as an apartment than hotels.Siemens's washing machine is good, with drying function, because there is no room for drying clothes in the room, so the drying function is very important.The kitchen is basically furnishings. In addition to the water heater and a coffee pot, there is nothing. You have to borrow pots and bowls from the front desk to cook.And such a expensive price does not include Internet costs.The service at the front desk is not bad.I used to live in Jing'an Yuting International Apartment, with more than 700 yuan two rooms, two halls, two guards and one kitchen. The dark wooden floor sofa is very comfortable.The bed is also very comfortable, a large down quilt.In contrast, the price and facilities of the Emperor Jingyuan Hotel's apartment are worthless.It is more attractive to get a lower price to win a lower price.Still that, in general, it should be pretty good, that is, the price is too high. The price of this scale is more reasonable.Supplementary comment on April 10, 2008: Oh, by the way, the hotel elevator to start with a card is more secure.It is a little grievancely rated as 3 stars, and 4 -star hardware is not enough. I think 3.5 stars are more appropriate."
0,除了地段可以，其他是一塌糊涂，惨不忍睹。和招待所差不多。,"Except for the location, everything else is a mess, terrible.It's almost the same as the guest house."
1,酒店房间内挺干净整洁，就是酒店没有隶属餐厅，吃饭不能签到房间的账单里。,"The hotel room is very clean and tidy, that is, the hotel is not affiliated with a restaurant, and the bill cannot be signed in the room."
1,1、地处市中心周围环境很好，房间总体符合四星级标准，但卫生间条件一般，房间电源插头太少，没找到空着的只好拔了落地灯电源才能给笔记本充电。2、床铺虽然很舒服，但感觉床单应该及时更换，洗得都太薄了，再用就没有本色儿了~3、电梯只有一部到地下停车场，等的时间较长！4、早餐一般不提也罢，总体来说如能改进下次还会来。,"1. The environment around the city center is very good. The room is generally in line with four -star standards, but the bathroom conditions are average. There are too few room power plugs. If you do n’t find the empty, you have to unplug the floor lamp power to charge the notebook.2. Although the bed is very comfortable, it feels that the sheets should be replaced in time, and they are too thin. There is no true character ~ 3. There is only one elevator to the underground parking lot, and the time is longer!4. Breakfast is generally not mentioned. Generally speaking, if it can be improved, it will come next time."
1,"订的是大床房,因为大床房没了,所以后来免费改为套房,房间蛮大的,卫生间也很大,设施不错.","The big bed room was ordered, because the big bed room was gone, so it was later changed to a suite for free. The room was quite large, the bathroom was very large, and the facilities were good."
0,本来定了3天，不过实在冷死了，，，没空调，也没有给暖气之类的打电话问前台，说没办法。那只能退房。根本不是4星级。延吉这个地方，找个小一点，干净一点的酒店住住更好换的是国贸附近的，有民俗房有地暖，还有空调舒服死了才160元。,"It was originally set for 3 days, but it was really cold. There was no air conditioner, and I did not call the front desk like heating, saying that there was no way.That can only check out.It is not 4 stars at all.In this place of Yanji, find a smaller, a cleaner hotel is near the country and trade near China Trade. There are folk houses with land heating, and only 160 yuan for air conditioning and comfortable air conditioning."
1,"早餐丰富.服务人员态度不错.但是入住时发现卫生间有积水,housekeeping来检查未有结果以为是我们的小孩子搞的,心情落差.擦干后半小时内又有积水,他们只能叫维修人员,原来是水斗的一个接头坏了.口头对不起.checkin&checkout比较快.Italian餐馆味道不错,服务很好.价格跟上海差不多.4楼海景不够好,应该往上层更佳.去海港城和广东道不够方便","Breakfast is rich. The attitude of the service staff is good. But when I check in, I found that there are accumulated water in the bathroom. Housekeeping is checked to check that there is no result that it is done by our children.The maintenance staff, it turned out that one of the joints of the water bucket was broken. Sorry for orally. Checkin & Checkout is faster. Italian restaurant tastes good and the service is good. The price is similar to Shanghai. The sea view on the 4th floor is not good enough.Canton Road is not convenient enough"
1,总体服务不错，高级房装修还可以，隔音太差，空调声音吵。但总体尚可,"The overall service is good, the high -end room decoration is okay, the sound insulation is too poor, and the sound of air conditioning is noisy.But overall"
0,这个酒店，本人已经是多次预订、多次入住了。个人感觉现在是越来越差。6/17早晨3点多，还是那一班火车到的的苏州，到锦地星座时大约4点，以为还能像以前那样顺利办理入住。接待当时都趴台上死睡，叫醒他们，希望办理入住，答复是：不可以，还有2小时才6点，6点后才能办理入住。如果6点前入住，要交一天的房费。我问能不能提供一下方便，按钟点房计费或者先给我住下，将相关的手续办到6点以后（以前都这么做的），接待的很不客气，说没办法。要么等，要么走。NND，LZ火冒三丈，但也不能跟这些人计较啊。从后门（富仁坊）出去30米，到汉庭住下了，人家那服务态度让人感觉真是宾至如归啊。结算按的是一天房费。需要说明一下的是：房间、设施跟锦地星座完全是一样的。只是没有早餐，那个值班经理还给我拿了15元的用品作为补偿。而房价只是锦地星座的一半。终归到底一句话，下次是肯定不会再住锦地星座了。宾馆反馈2008年7月7日：首先对您多次入住本酒店表示忠心感谢！您提出的问题酒店领导层高度重视，并进行了整改。本酒店就您提出的入住时间问题予以以下说明：根据行业规定，本酒店针对每天06：00点以后入住的宾客只算当天房价，您前两次来本店的入住的时间是：06：06分（06年8月24日），05：59分（08年5月22日），当时总台服务员给予变通解决，而您6月17日凌晨是03：45分抵达本酒店，离规定6；00点相差时间较长，当时总台服务员给您作出了充分解释。尽管如此，您的意见我们仍会虚心接受，以后针对此种情况，我们会作出变通处理。再次衷心地欢迎您下次人住本酒店。,"This hotel has been reservation and staying multiple times.Personally feel that it is getting worse and worse now.At 3 o'clock in the morning of 6/17, it was still the train where the train arrived at about 4 o'clock when he arrived at the Jindi constellation. He thought he could handle it smoothly as before.At that time, I died on the stage and woke them up. I hope to check in. The reply is: No, there are 2 hours of 2 hours, and I can handle it after 6 o'clock.If you stay before 6 o'clock, pay a day's house fee.I ask if I can provide convenience, follow the clock room, or give me first, and complete the relevant procedures after 6 o'clock (I did it before). The reception was very polite and said that there was no way.Either wait or go.NND, LZ is furious, but you can't care about these people.From the back door (Fu Renfang) 30 meters, he lived in Han Ting. The service attitude of others makes people feel that it is a guest.The settlement is a one -day room fee.It should be explained that the room and facilities are the same as the Jindi constellation.It was just no breakfast, and the duty manager also gave me 15 yuan supplies as compensation.And house prices are just half of the Jindi constellation.In the end, in the end, next time, I will definitely not live in the Jindi constellation.Hotel feedback on July 7, 2008: First of all, I would like to express my loyalty for staying in this hotel many times!The problems you raised are highly valued and rectified.The hotel will explain the following issues that you put forward: According to the industry regulations, the hotel only counts the house price on the day for guests who stay in the store for the first two times.(August 24, 2006), 05:59 (May 22, 2008), the waiter of the main station was resolved, and you arrived at this hotel at 03:45 in the early morning of June 17th, from the regulations 6;The difference between 00 points is long. At that time, the waiters of the main station gave you a full explanation.Nevertheless, we will still accept your opinion. In the future, we will make a transformation treatment for this situation.I sincerely welcome you to stay in this hotel next time."
0,酒店服务意识很差，餐厅不能签单，说是怕消费的高于预授权。服务生明显没有经过培训。,"The hotel service awareness is very poor, and the restaurant cannot sign orders, saying that they are afraid of consumption higher than pre -authorization.The waiter obviously did not undergo training."
1,"离机场算是比较近的酒店,规模看上去不错,服务不错,酒店餐厅也不错,最赞的是大床房,很棒.",The hotel is relatively close to the airport. The scale looks good and the service is good. The hotel and restaurant are also good.
1,多次住了，感觉比汇东好一点。实际上在自贡也没有更多酒店可选了。,"I have lived many times, and I feel better than Huidong.In fact, there are no more hotels in Zigong."
1,"影响最深的是自助餐较丰盛,只是虾,蟹等要另外购买.价格也很公道.","The deepest impact is that the buffet is more abundant, but the shrimp, crabs, etc. are purchased separately. The price is also fair."
1,位置不错...到八万人体育场也不远..就是高层公寓吧，服务没什么特别的因为都没带酒店里，呵呵,"The location is good ... it is not far from the 80,000 people stadium .. It is a high -rise apartment. There is nothing special about the service."
1,环境很好，服务也不错，推荐下次还会住这里,The environment is very good and the service is good. I recommend it to live here next time
1,这次到南京才知道原来这家酒店是名古屋和南京合作的一家酒店，名字就取的这两个城市的各一个字，怪不得有点怪怪的感觉，属于比较早期的一家五星级酒店。管理比较完善，表现在checkin/out，服务，电梯的速度等等方面。唯一就是门口叫出租车不太容易，门口也太过朴实无华。总体还是一家中规中矩的五星级酒店。,"This time I arrived at Nanjing that the original hotel was a hotel cooperated with Nagoya and Nanjing. The names of the two cities that were named were a bit strange. It belonged to a relatively early five -star hotel.Management is relatively complete, manifested in Checkin/OUT, service, elevator speed, etc.The only thing is that it is not easy to call a taxi at the door, and the door is too simple.Overall is a five -star hotel."
1,"早餐很赞,很有当地特色,房间内设施有点旧了,好在有无敌海景大阳台,好象新楼在建了,期待ING...","The breakfast is very good, very local, and the facilities in the room are a bit old. Fortunately, there is an invincible sea view balcony, as if the new building is under construction, I look forward to ing ..."
1,扬子岛酒店的位置很好，逛街、购物、吃饭、娱乐都很方便，酒店对面就是大都会和太平洋商场，背后就是美美百货。酒店的装修也很不错，干净整洁。最重要的是，价格也比较便宜。总之，作为一家四星级的酒店，扬子岛不管是服务还是环境都非常的到位，甚至感觉比一些五星级酒店要好。不过，扬子岛自己本身的健身中心、娱乐设施我们没有尝试过，因此不做评论。,"The location of the Yangtze Island Hotel is very good, shopping, shopping, eating, and entertainment are very convenient. Opposite the hotel is Metropolis and Pacific Shopping Malls, and behind it is Meimei Department Store.The decoration of the hotel is also very good, clean and tidy.The most important thing is that the price is relatively cheap.In short, as a four -star hotel, Yangtze Island is in place in both services and the environment, and even feels better than some five -star hotels.However, we have not tried the fitness center and entertainment facilities of Yangtze Island itself, so we do not comment."
1,不错的酒店，设施很齐全，周到。特别是一些小的细节。周围的环境也不错。,"Good hotels, the facilities are very complete and thoughtful.Especially small details.The surrounding environment is also good."
1,"服务不错,餐饮很好,A座房间该重新装修了.补充点评2008年2月20日：感觉总体上不如鸳飞大酒店.","The service is good, the catering is very good, the room A room should be renovated. Supplementary comment February 20, 2008: It feels not as good as the Grand Hotel."
0,房间小得无法转身，晚上十时没有热水冲凉，找人帮忙，坚持说水是热的，只是不够热，因为有客人中午时提出水太热，所以调到低温，如果嫌凉，可以重新调到高温，但必须一小时后现能有热水。他们说这话时，我女儿就可怜兮兮地裹着条浴巾看着他们发呆。,"The room couldn't turn around. There was no hot water shower at 10 o'clock in the evening. Find someone to help, insist that the water is hot, but it is not hot enough, because some guests propose that the water is too hot at noon, so it is adjusted to low temperature.Towards high temperature, but it must be hot water after an hour.When they said this, my daughter wrapped in a bath towel with a pitifully wrapped in a daze."
1,大床房非常好．最值得推荐的是游泳池和免费长途电话，缺点是大堂太小以及门口的出租车，只要是去机场肯定多要钱，从机场来时只７４元，去机场要１００元，没时间和他理论．,"The big bed room is very good.The most recommended is the swimming pool and free long -distance telephone. The disadvantage is that the lobby is too small and the taxi at the door. As long as you go to the airport, you must ask for more money. When you come from the airport, only 74 yuan, 100 yuan to the airport..."
1,地理位置优越，服务员态度也相当不错。值得推荐。,"The geographical location is superior, and the waiter's attitude is quite good.Recommended."
1,位置还可以离解放碑地区不远，打车起步价（5元），房间价格236元，我的房间还可以看到江景，电视卫星频道不错选择很多，房间不算大，洗手间很小，但还算清洁。总得来说性价比还可以。,"The location can also be not far from the Jiefangbei area. The starting price of the taxi (5 yuan), the room price is 236 yuan. I can also see Jiang Jing in my room. The TV satellite channel is good.It's not clean.It is always possible to be cost -effective."
0,入住时处于展会附近，到前台时被告知由于晚到1小时，定单取消了。追问是否还有房间，回答曰：“没有”（大概是生意太好，不想做携程生意）向携程反映，发现是信用卡担保定单-于是立刻有房间了。进入房间，发现没有打扫过，反映给前台，说立刻通知处理，结果等了40分钟，催了4次，发了火才有服务员来。房间不错，没有多余的无必要的设施，但外墙由于挂了竖幅，大风吹着猎猎作响，影响睡眠。还没完，早上专门买了餐券，到自助餐厅-什么都没剩下，稀饭都没有，难道两个人花30元，分食唯一的一片面包？还有其他人也在虎视耽耽。,"It was near the exhibition at the time of check -in. When I arrived at the front desk, I was told that the order was canceled because it was 1 hour late.Ask if there is still a room, and the answer said: ""No"" (probably the business is too good, don't want to do a Ctrip business) to report to Ctrip, and find that the credit card guarantee order-then there is a room immediately.When I entered the room, I found that I hadn't cleaned it. It was reflected to the front desk, and said it was immediately notified. As a result, I waited for 40 minutes and urged 4 times.The room is good, there is no unnecessary facility, but due to the vertical amplitude of the outer wall, the wind blows hunting and affects sleep.It's not over yet. I bought a meal coupon in the morning. I went to the buffet restaurant-there was nothing left, and there was no porridge. Is it 30 yuan for two people to share the only piece of bread?Other people are also delaying."
1,好像第二次入住了，这次的标间环境不好，房间感觉不台干净，电视机也不好,It seems that I stayed for the second time.

1,地点很方便，就在火车站附近走路3分钟，但是因为第一次去竟然打了车被司机宰了个起步价，唯一的不足也是离火车站太近了，火车的声音比较麻烦，谁让徐州自古就是交通要道呢，呵呵。如果有可能下次还要入住。,"The location is very convenient, walking near the railway station for 3 minutes, but because of the first time I went, I was slaughtered by the driver. The only deficiency was too close to the train station.Xuzhou has been a traffic road since ancient times, haha.If you may stay next time, you may have to stay."
1,上一次在德州住的是富丽华，实在是不咋样，只能用一个字来形容：土。但这次住在贵都的感觉非常好，价格不贵，房间也比较舒适、干净。对早餐非常满意。,"The last time I lived in Texas was Fu Lihua. It was really good. I could only use one word to describe: soil.But this time I felt very good in Guidu, the price was not expensive, and the room was more comfortable and clean.Satisfied with breakfast."
0,客观地说，这个酒店不怎么样。列出来大家参考：一、晚上八点半到的，没看到门童；二、没有吹风机，三、网线收在电视柜后面，打电话到客房中心才知道还是有网线的；四、第二天想迟个十来分钟退房，前台说没办法，要加收钱，住了这么多酒店头回见着这么呆板的；五、结账时要个信封，没有。六、结账时水单没给我，打电话过去要，说要一点半后再打过去帮我查。这种酒店还能挂星啊？,"Objectively speaking, this hotel is not good.Everyone reference for everyone: First, at 8:30 in the evening, I did not see the doorboy; 2. There was no hair dryer. Third, the network cable was collected behind the TV cabinet, and I called the guest room center to know that there was still a network line;Tian wanted to check out for more than ten minutes. The front desk said that there was no way to collect money. I saw so many hotels and saw so rigid.6. I did n’t give me the water list at the checkout. I called the phone and said that I would call me to check it.Can this hotel still hang on the stars?"
1,离火车站很近很方便。住在东楼标间，相比较在九江住的另一家酒店，房间比较大。卫生间设施略旧。服务还好。10元中式早餐也不错，很丰富，居然还有青菜肉片汤。,"It is very close to the railway station.Living in the Donglou standard room, compared to another hotel in Jiujiang, the room is relatively large.The bathroom facilities are slightly old.The service is okay.10 yuan Chinese breakfast is also good, very rich, and there is actually green vegetable slices soup."
0,最大的优点也就是价钱比较实惠，另外有免费停车场（如果住在古镇里面，白天是不允许把车开进去的）。这个宾馆的服务员都说自己的餐厅做的当地小吃好吃，实在不敢苟同，份量少，味道也不地道，价格却不低，建议重视当地美食的朋友不要在宾馆的餐厅就餐，会对山西的小吃产生错误印象的。,"The biggest advantage is that the price is relatively affordable, and there are free parking lots (if you live in the ancient town, you are not allowed to drive in during the day).The waiters of this hotel said that the local snacks made by their restaurants are delicious, and they are really unswerving. They are small, the taste is not authentic, but the price is not low. Friends who pay attention to local food should not dine in the hotel's restaurant.The snacks make an error impression."
1,不错，住得挺舒服的。就是打的不方便，要走很远才能截到的士。,"Yes, I live comfortably.It is inconvenient to fight."
1,临近地铁，附近还有一家超市和大家乐快餐店，比较方便。虽然紧贴殡仪馆，但没什么特别不妥。房间不大，有水果。安静，舒适。洗手间也不大，坐便器位置太贴墙了，感觉不大自在。没有梳子，还得问客服要。服务员比较热情，耐心为你指路并告诉你如何搭车。总体来讲还不错。,"Near the subway, there is a supermarket nearby and a fast food restaurant for everyone, which is more convenient.Although it is close to the funeral home, there is nothing particularly inappropriate.The room is not large, there are fruits.Quiet, comfortable.The toilet is not large, the position of the toilet is too close to the wall, and it feels not free.Without a comb, you have to ask the customer service.The waiter is more enthusiastic, patiently pointing for you and telling you how to get a car.Overall is not bad."
1,"房间设施不错,前台服务也不错.交通方便,停车场很大.","The room facilities are good, the front desk service is also good. The transportation is convenient, and the parking lot is very large."
1,"对于行政套房这个级别来说,房间小,卫生间设施过于简单.在窗户底下有大楼的中央空调的排气管,造成开窗后废气进入房间.行政楼层的行政酒廊看起来很简陋补充点评2007年11月5日：大堂看起来很漂亮,房间的窗户外的景色很好,不错的自助早餐,较快的网络速度","For the level of administrative suite, the room is small and the bathroom facilities are too simple. There is an exhaust pipe of the central air -conditioning of the building under the window, resulting in the waste gas entering the room after opening the window.November 5th: The lobby looks very beautiful, the scenery outside the room is very good, good buffet breakfast, fast network speed"
1,虽然我住的是豪华房，但是房间的设施还是显得有些陈旧。早点并不是非常的丰富，不过我想对于在四星饭店里的50元钱的早点，可能是我要求过高了。不过这个酒店的门脸可这是够背的。藏在了一个小胡同里面。不过还好出租车司机都知道。,"Although I live in a luxurious room, the facilities in the room still look a little old.Early, it is not very rich, but I think I may ask for too much early in the four -star restaurant.But this hotel's door face is enough.Hidden in a small alley.Fortunately, the taxi driver knows."
1,该酒店地理位置很好，交通便利，在市中心，入住酒店时一进门就有服务员热情的招呼声，总台的男、女服务员特热情，办事效率也挺快，每次都会面带微笑向客人问好，入住的房间总体来说还算干净，房间内还有免费赠送的矿泉水。楼层服务员非常热情，是一个给了我很好的感觉的，非常适合商务人士入住的酒店。以后到南通这便是我的家。,"The hotel has a good geographical location and convenient transportation. In the city center, the waiter has enthusiastic greetings as soon as you enter the hotel.The guests asked well, the room where the stay was generally clean, and there were free mineral water in the room.The waiter of the floor is very enthusiastic and a hotel that gives me a good feeling, which is very suitable for business people to stay in.In Nantong, this is my home."
1,挺不错的酒店，每次去盐城都住在这里，价格便宜量又足！,"A good hotel, every time I go to Yancheng, I live here. The price is cheap and enough!"
1,服务生很周到，携程和酒店的合作应该很好，有水果送，又可以免费洗烫2件衣服，而且速度很快，我们去的时候有人开会，估计占了很多房间，没有相应的房间了，酒店免费给我们升级，入住商务房。不过酒店有点旧了，该翻新一下了。还有就是周围没什么商场，晚上吃完饭想下去走走，周围全是卖烟酒的，难怪郑州空气那么差……其余都很好。相当满意。,"The waiter is very thoughtful. The cooperation between Ctrip and the hotel should be very good. There are fruits and can be washed 2 pieces of clothes for free, and the speed is fast. When we go, someone will meet. It is estimated that there are many rooms.The hotel will be upgraded for free and stays in business houses.But the hotel is a bit old, it's time to renovate.There is no shopping mall around. I want to go around after eating at night. The surroundings are all selling tobacco and alcohol. No wonder Zhengzhou's air is so bad ... the rest is very good.Quite satisfied."
0,"差的没话说了，我同事在这里吃了三次早餐拉了两次肚子。这个酒店不会收拾房间的，用完的浴巾都不知道收拾，房间的垃圾也不知道收拾，所以如果不小心住进来了就千万别续住。前台的态度也很差，好像都欠了他们的钱一样。空调声音极大,晚上都无法休息。床极其不舒服，坑坑洼洼的早上起来腿上都有印痕。吃饭超级贵，都是政府来消费的。骚扰电话很早就开始，很晚才结束。门口的出租车虽然是正规出租但是素质都很差，近距离就拒载，远距离就绕路，和青岛有一拼了。小日本巨多，早餐吃饭的时候看着小日本就没胃口。","There was nothing to say, my colleague had three breakfast here and pulled my stomach twice.This hotel will not clean up the room. I do n’t know how to clean up the bath towels.The attitude of the front desk is also very poor, as if they owe their money.The sound of air conditioners was very loud and could not rest at night.The bed was extremely uncomfortable, and there were marks on the legs in the potholes in the morning.It is super expensive to eat, all of which are consumed by the government.The harassment phone started early and ended late.Although the taxi at the door is a regular rental, the quality is very poor. It refuses to load at close range, and has a long distance. It is a fight with Qingdao.Little Japan is giant, and when you eat breakfast, you have no appetite when you look at Little Japan."
0,太差了！！！不知道怎么评的四星！！！肯定贿赂了评酒店星级的人。,too poor!IntersectionIntersectionI don't know how to comment four stars!IntersectionIntersectionI have bribed the hotel star -level people.
1,酒店客房绕池塘而建，池中金鱼频添几分情趣，主客房可餐厅由池塘相隔，安静，优雅。前后两停车场，接客送客相当方便。不足之处，特价房的部分电器较旧。,"The hotel rooms are built around the pond, and the goldfish in the pond adds a bit of interest. The main room can be separated from the pond, quiet and elegant.The two parking lots before and after the parking lot, it is quite convenient to pick up customers.In shortcoming, some electrical appliances of special rooms are older."
1,"虽然表面看很一般,但里面装修还是很精致的,住着干净,舒服;以后去宜兴首选还是宜兴宾馆!","Although it looks average, the decoration inside is still exquisite, live clean and comfortable; in the future, the preferred choice of Yixing is still Yixing Hotel!"
1,对的起价格。还有就是安静。就是大床竟然是二张小床拼的。让人郁闷。就是看他安静。所以我每次来还是住这了。,The right price.There is also quiet.The big bed turned out to be two small beds.It is depressed.Just look at him quietly.So every time I still live here.
1,地点非常好，离后海的酒吧街很近，晚上去泡吧非常方便。但是酒店设施比较陈旧，房间的卫生间里的吹风机居然是坏的。我住的商务电脑间，所谓的商务电脑间就是有个显示器和一个键盘，如果你要是想上网，还是需要自己带电脑，连接上去……这个我有点不明白……难道有人会只带个电脑的主机出门？不过考虑到性价比，还算可以吧。我主要是喜欢这个位置。,"The location is very good, it is very close to the bar street in Houhai. It is very convenient to go to the night in the evening.However, the hotel facilities are relatively old, and the hair dryer in the bathroom in the room is actually bad.In the business computer I live, there is a monitor and a keyboard room between the so -called business computer. If you want to surf the Internet, you still need to bring your own computer and connect it ... I don’t understand this ... someone will only bring a computer with a computerGo out?However, considering the cost -effectiveness, it is okay.I mainly like this position."
1,"干净,交通方便,服务态度也不错,368的房间带的早餐也可以.就是老宾馆,设施较老.价格略偏高","Clean, convenient transportation, good service attitude, breakfast with 368 rooms can also be. It is an old hotel with older facilities. The price is slightly higher"
1,在湛江应该算是比较好的酒店了，在霞山和赤坎中间开发区内。服务生的态度，大堂的环境都还不错，就是酒店外面的停车乱一点，应该好好管理一下。,"It should be considered a better hotel in Zhanjiang, in the middle development zone in Xiashan and Chikan.The attitude of the waiter and the environment of the lobby are not bad, that is, the parking outside the hotel is a bit messy, and it should be managed."
1,不能说没有一点点问题，但酒店所有员工都在用一种非常的热情给每一个客人以尽可能的服务，所以，我愿意把最高的评价给这个酒店。,"It cannot be said that there is no problem, but all the hotel employees are using a very enthusiastic service to serve as possible as possible, so I am willing to give the highest evaluation to the hotel."
0,绝对是徒有其表的一家酒店。4月30日晚入住，室外温度30度的情况下，房间没有空调，当我们提出意见时，居然说怕客人着凉？！！我们盖的可是鸭绒被啊！再三要求下，拿来一个电风扇忽悠我们...第二天早上的自助餐厅也是一样的闷热。堂堂所谓4星酒店，连空调都不舍得开？这样的酒店大约是不会再住的。,"It is definitely a hotel with a table.In the evening of April 30, when the outdoor temperature was 30 degrees, there was no air conditioner in the room. When we raised opinions, we actually said that we were afraid of the guests?IntersectionIntersectionWe covered the duck down quilt!After repeated requests, bring an electric fan to fool us ...

0,"酒店已经比较旧了,海景房也很一般.酒店的拖鞋据称不是一次性的,但没有在包装上说明,再要需要收费10元每双!也没发现这个拖鞋和其他五星级酒店比有什么特别显著的差异!收拖鞋费用实在对不起这么性价比不高的房费!所以你要准备好拖鞋不能在住店期间搞湿弄脏,这意味着收费!可能酒店会理直气壮地给你环保的理由!下次不会在住了,实在看不出有什么特别舒服的地方!可以再去海悦建国试试!反正这个酒店的海景房也没什么意思!而且房间相当一般般!服务也没什么可以值得称道的!甚至肯定比不上泰安的遵华华美达,虽然泰安是一个小地方!","The hotel is relatively old, and the sea view room is also very average. The hotel's slippers are said to be not one -time, but it is not explained in the packaging, and it needs to be charged for 10 yuan per pair!There are any particularly significant differences!

0,在天津是很差的酒店，定了４个单人间，结果２个没有窗户，２个只能看见相距很近的楼房屋顶，价格还偏高，又不含早，真是差极啦，结果定了２天一天就退房了，因为离天津＼南开大学比较近才选择，永远不会在这里住，充其量也就是一个准二星．,"It is a very poor hotel in Tianjin. There are 4 single rooms. As a result, there are two windows without windows. Two can only see the roof of the building that is close to each other. The price is still high.After two days and a day, I got out of the room, because I chose it because I was closer to the Nankai University of Tianjin, and I would never live here.

1,酒店交通确实很方便，出门就是公交站点，去海鲜广场和第一市场很便利。虽没有自己的沙滩，但穿过大东海广场就是沙滩，还是比较近的。不足的是酒店隔音设施不是很好，而且酒店的打扫时间过早。,"Hotel transportation is really convenient. It is a bus station to go out. It is convenient to go to seafood square and the first market.Although there is no own beach, it is a beach through the Great Donghai Plaza, which is relatively close.The lack is that the hotel's sound insulation facilities are not very good, and the hotel's cleaning time is too early."
0,1.房间有较重的装修气味！2.隔音效果差3.预订的内容不能保证，我订的双人床房间成了双人大床房间！,1. The room has a heavy decoration smell!2. Poor sound insulation effect 3. The content of the booking cannot be guaranteed. The double bed room I ordered has become a double bed room!
0,以前住过一次，发现了一只老鼠，后来看到别人说他们重新装修过，所以这次还是选了这个酒店。可是实在是让我失望，一切如旧，什么也没有变，只住了一个晚上，我就生病了。下次再也不会住这个酒店了。,"I lived once and found a mouse. Later, I saw others say that they had renovated, so I chose this hotel this time.But it really disappointed me, everything was old, nothing changed, and I was sick for only one night.I will never live in this hotel next time."

1,在北京CBD，还能找到300多元钱的套房式酒店真的太难了，房间干净、舒适，网线电脑都免费使用，客厅很大，可以招待朋友或商议事情！像我们这样经常在外出差的人能找到一家这样高型价比的酒店还真不容易！建议大家亲身感受一下再做评论！我的朋友都非常满意！,"In Beijing CBD, it is really difficult to find a suite -style hotel of more than 300 yuan. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The network cable computers are used for free. The living room is large.

0,房间根本就是走廊通道改建的，又长又窄，窗户很小，窗户外面是救生楼梯，旁边是一扇好大的铁制的救生门，住在里面一点安全感也没有。没有宽带。没有冰箱。没有烧水的壶，只有一部不是很干净的饮水机。浴室也很一般，看起来脏脏的。周边环境也不是很好，不像市中心。地下停车场又小又黑，附件也没有好的停车场，对自驾游的我们来说极不方便。根本就不像是三星级的酒店，与网上介绍的相差甚远。,"The room was renovated by the corridor passage, which was long and narrow. The windows were small. The window outside was a life -saving staircase, and a large iron -made life door was next to it. There was no sense of security in it.No broadband.No refrigerator.There is no pot of water, there is only one water dispenser that is not very clean.The bathroom is also very general, and it looks dirty.The surrounding environment is not very good, unlike the city center.The underground parking lot is small and dark, and there are no good parking lots in the attachment, which is extremely inconvenient for us to travel.It is not like a three -star hotel at all, which is far from the online introduction."
1,此次入住双人豪华商务房有提供计算机，饭店位置离机场巴士终点上清寺站打出租车起步价五块，坐轻轨在曾家岩站下车Ｃ号出口。交通位置方便，住起来也安静。,"This time, the two -person luxury business house provides a computer. The hotel location is from the airport bus terminal, Shangqing Temple Station, and the taxi starting price is five yuan.The traffic location is convenient and quiet to live."
1,首先，服务员态度可以，有电梯，房间比较干净，床很大，下次还会住的，不过早餐比较差点,"First of all, the waiter's attitude is okay. There are elevators, the room is relatively clean, the bed is very large, and will live next time, but breakfast is almost almost"
0,很一般。性价比很差。跟上海的快捷酒店相比，价格贵，服务差；外面空气不错。但是内部装修亟待改善；窗户的高度太低，不小心会摔下去；令人匪夷所思的是，订的是大床房，但是床却是坏的；感觉很不好。,"Very ordinary.The price / performance ratio is very poor.Compared with Shanghai's Express Hotel, the price is expensive and the service is poor; the air outside is good.However, the internal decoration needs to be improved; the height of the window is too low, and it will fall down accidentally; what is incredible is that the large bed room is ordered, but the bed is bad; it feels bad."
0,酒店最大的特色就是房间大。问题在于，我在前台明明刷了两天的预授权，但是服务员却只给我做了一天的房卡，我每个月都会至少住一次太平洋，每次至少3天，每次只做一天房卡的事情发生也不止一次了！！而且楼层电话是坏的，没办法打到前台区，每次都害得我跑到大堂去重做房卡，这样的服务是在是让人气愤！！,"The biggest feature of the hotel is the large room.The problem is that I had a pre -authorization of two days at the front desk, but the waiter only gave me a day card. I live at least once a month.The card happened more than once!IntersectionAnd the floor of the floor is bad, there is no way to hit the front desk area, and every time I hurt me to the lobby to make a room card.

0,作为一家准四星，居然不能使用信用卡，各位要注意带足money。酒店园内有拉萨著名的纵横夜总会，夜夜笙歌，声音极大，不到一二点不会歇，打到大堂副理也无能为力，因为不属于酒店管，8月21日入住一夜后第二天赶快逃跑。这样的地方居然标间敢收520？！其实，拉萨有很多性价比很高的酒店，建议携程多考察。,"As a quasi -four -star, you can't use a credit card, you should pay attention to Money.There is a famous Lhasa's famous nightclub in the hotel garden. The night is singing, and the sound is loud. It will not be able to rest in less than one or two o'clock.Hurry up and run away.Such a place dares to receive 520?IntersectionIn fact, there are many cost -effective hotels in Lhasa.

It takes 45 minutes from the long -distance station to the hotel to go 100 yuan.The wooden house originally ordered, then climbed out of the waterway in the bathroom to go out of 15 cm long and long -pass and sent a red cricket, raging in the room.I was so scared that we were stunned.

0,"宾馆背面就是省道,交通是方便的,停车场很大也很方便,但晚上尤其半夜路过的汽车声音很响,拖拉机的声音平均15分钟出现一次,影响休息.建议要入住此宾馆的朋友一定要选南面的房间,这样可以远离点噪音.","The back of the hotel is the provincial road. The transportation is convenient. The parking lot is very large and convenient. However, the sound of the car passing by in the middle of the night is very loud.

1,房间不错，下次有机会还会继续入住的。价格能再便宜写就更加ok了。,"The room is good, and I will continue to stay in the next time.The price can be more cheap to write."
0,建议旅游的人住道里区，这个酒店太远了，交通不方便，客房新装修，但浴室小且有异味。白天水温不热。自己去的价格比携程的价格要便宜，约150到180就能拿下。不过服务态度停不错的。,"It is recommended to travel in the road in the road. This hotel is too far, the transportation is inconvenient, the room is decorated, but the bathroom is small and odor.The temperature of the water during the day is not hot.The price you go is cheaper than the price of Ctrip, which can be won by about 150 to 180.But the service attitude is good."

1,酒店周边环境比较乱，哈尔滨很多酒店都有这个问题。但酒店内部环境还行，性价比不错，离商业中心和火车站都很近，而且酒店主动给携程客人免费升级入住，这一点感觉很好。服务人员也热情周到，下次还会入住此酒店。,"The surrounding environment of the hotel is relatively chaotic, and many hotels in Harbin have this problem.However, the internal environment of the hotel is okay, the cost performance is good, it is very close to the commercial center and the railway station, and the hotel takes the initiative to upgrade the check -in for Ctrip guests. This feels good.The service staff is also enthusiastic and thoughtful, and will stay in this hotel next time."

0,超差！！！建议所有人不要来住！大门开在胡同里，找不着。每天早上你会被服务员聊天吵醒，都不用闹钟的！该提供的服务长话网络你在前台不声明，是全都不能用的，投诉无用，态度够你喝一壶的。哈尔滨的形象就这样破坏的。,"Very bad!IntersectionIntersectionIt is recommended that everyone do not come to live!The door opened in the alley and couldn't find it.You will be awakened by the waiter every morning, you don't need a alarm clock!You are not using the service long words network at the front desk.

1,服务稍微差一点，入住后房间打扫不彻底，床单不能每天更换。,"The service is a little worse. After check -in, the room is not completely cleaned, and the sheets cannot be replaced every day."
1,这次入住的宜兴宾馆性价比还是比较高的，房间很大，房内布置也比较温馨。早餐品种太少了，服务员态度比较好。,"The price -performance ratio of Yixing Hotel that stayed this time is still relatively high, the room is large, and the house layout is relatively warm.There are too few breakfast varieties, and the waiter has a better attitude."
1,在庐山这样的名胜旅游区，这样的酒店已经不错。地点很好，特别是自驾游的旅客，上下山都很方便。只是好象节能有点过了头，走廊没开灯。携程说有扑克送也没有送给我们。补充点评2007年9月28日：对了，卫生条件一般。有电脑上网，这一点对我们这些年轻一点的旅游者来说是很好的事情，毕竟下一站的定房，路线查询都需要上网才能解决。,"In a famous tourist area like Lushan, such a hotel is already good.The location is very good, especially for self -driving tourists. It is very convenient to go up and down.It seems that energy saving is a bit too much, and the corridor does not turn on the lights.Ctrip said that there were no poker sent to us.Supplementary comment on September 28, 2007: By the way, sanitary conditions are average.There is a computer to access the Internet. This is a good thing for our young tourists. After all, the next -stop houses, route queries need to be solved."
1,虽是公寓式酒店，但其房间整洁程度、全方位的服务都给我留下了很好的印象。丝丝不完善之处在于很多出租车司机都没听说此酒店。,"Although it is an apartment -style hotel, the neat degree and all -round service of the room have left a good impression on me.The incompleteness is that many taxi drivers have not heard of this hotel."

1,"酒店处于石老人海水浴场附近，非常优美。好像是2005年开张的，所以还比较新。早餐和自助晚餐都很丰富，火锅是一大惊喜，酱料很齐全，有麻酱，两种辣酱，蒜末等等。不过价钱稍微贵了一些。健身房有点失修，泳池和水疗中心因住客是免费的，非常令人享受。行政套房有宽带台式电脑，浴缸也很漂亮，房里的设备比较精致。Cable只有StarMovies,没有我最爱的HBO和AXN，有点可惜。服务非常好，随要随送。","The hotel is near the old seawater bath, which is very beautiful.It seems to be opened in 2005, so it is relatively new.Breakfast and buffet dinner are very rich.

1,由于2007年新装修，有一些新问题可能还没来得及解决，我因为工作需要经常要住那里，所以慎重的提出以下意见、建议：1、新装修后单人间的淋浴间淋浴喷头的位置都太高，我换了房间还是一样，很不好用2、新开业后的一些管理和服务还很不到位，尤其是前台入住和结帐时代效率太低（每次结帐都超过10分钟，好像不符合四星宾馆的要求）,"Since new decoration in 2007, some new problems may not have been resolved yet. I often have to live there because of work needs, so I carefully put forward the following opinions and suggestions: 1.High, I changed the room for the same. It is not easy to use 2. Some management and services after the new opening are still not in place, especially the at the front desk is too low in efficiency (each checkout for more than 10 minutes each time, it seems that it seems that it seems thatNo requirements for the four -star hotel)"
1,其实已经住过这间酒店很多次了，以前是公司合同酒店，所以不能在这里评价，但实际上，我喜欢这间酒店已经很久了。这间酒店是我在深圳的两间指定酒店之一。以前去，这间酒店的大堂有股霉味，这次去已经好多了。缺点就是酒店大堂太小了。服务非常好，服务员态度很好，很有礼貌。只是三部电梯中的一部太小了，而且，不能和其它两部电梯联动。房间异常的好，只是风景不好(这是没办法的)。交通方便，有很多出租车。因为酒店在住宅区里，大堂旁边就是银行提款机，对面是便利店，酒店旁边有一个咖啡酒吧。总之，这间酒店极好，极有推荐价值。反正我下次还会住的补充点评2008年7月31日：补充楼下人说房间里的“的、的、的”声，这是空调的声音，我试过，把空调管理睡就好了(但不可能，太热了)，我房间也有这种声响，但不影响睡眠，建议酒店看一下，怪恐怖的，但实际上，真的不用害怕。还有，床很舒服，但很小。建议：提供“荞麦”枕头，比如我，我就不喜欢那种软的枕头，睡着不舒服。,"In fact, I have lived in this hotel many times. It used to be a company contract hotel, so I ca n’t evaluate it here, but in fact, I have long liked this hotel for a long time.This hotel is one of my two designated hotels in Shenzhen.In the past, the lobby of this hotel had a lot of money, and this time it was much better.The disadvantage is that the hotel lobby is too small.The service is very good, the waiter attitude is very good and polite.It's just one of the three elevators too small, and it cannot be linked to the other two elevators.The room is extremely good, but the scenery is not good (this is no way).Convenient transportation, there are many taxis.Because the hotel is in the residential area, next to the lobby is a bank withdrawal machine, the opposite is a convenience store, and there is a coffee bar next to the hotel.In short, this hotel is very good and highly recommended.Anyway, I will also live next time I will stay on July 31, 2008: Supplement the "",,,"" sound of "",,"" in the room in the room.(But impossible, too hot), my room also has this sound, but it does not affect sleep.

1,房间还行，满适合商务出差。距离机场仅35~40分钟的车程，就在天津经济开发区内，属于塘沽地区。周边环境已经很成熟，餐饮娱乐都有，个人感觉很方便。补充点评2007年12月26日：但是低楼层的房间没有窗户，这一点可能会比较令人郁闷。当然如果多出一点钱就可以订到楼层高一点（10楼以上）的房间，那养的话窗外风景感觉就迥然不同了。前两天刚去过，正值圣诞夜，还获赠了一个圣诞老人的蜡烛，很可爱哦！,"The room is okay, and it is suitable for business trips.The 35 ~ 40 -minute drive from the airport is in the Tianjin Economic Development Zone and belongs to the Tanggu area.The surrounding environment is already very mature, and there are catering and entertainment, and I feel very convenient.Supplementary comment on December 26, 2007: But there are no windows on the low -floor room, which may be more depressed.Of course, if you pay a little more money, you can order a room with a higher floor (above 10th floor), and the scenery of the window outside the window is very different.Just two days ago, it was on Christmas Eve, and I also received a candle of Santa Claus.

1,酒店的软件实在不敢恭唯，特别是前台小姐！！。CHECKIN的时候说房间不够，只给2间。过会儿又说没有大床房。总之，不想给我们房间，因为携程当初订了7间，现在只订了4间。从中午11点多等到下午1点多才给了我们大床房。CHECKOUT的时候，又是等了很长很长时间。房间不够大，但硬件还能达到4星。是那里最好的HOTEL了。总之，不要报太大的希望去可能就不会失望了。特别说一下，酒店旁边的月亮岛是夏天避暑的好去处。,"The hotel's software is really dare not, especially the lady of the front desk!IntersectionEssenceWhen checkin, I said that the room was not enough, only 2 rooms.After a while, there was no big bed room.In short, I don't want to give us a room, because Ctrip originally ordered 7 rooms, and now I only booked 4.From 11:00 noon until 1 pm, we gave us a big bed.When checkout, it waited for a long time.The room is not large enough, but the hardware can reach 4 stars.It's the best Hotel there.In short, don't be disappointed if you don't have too much hope.In particular, the Moon Island next to the hotel is a good place for summer summer heat."
1,"又一次入住,服务一如既往,无可挑剔,但就是携程的价格有点贵了~","Once again, the service is as ever, but it is impeccable, but the price of Ctrip is a bit expensive ~"
1,"很好的酒店,很规范植得一住.餐厅一般不应该的,不知道为什么.宾馆反馈2008年4月17日：餐厅现已重新装修，用餐环境较以前要好的多。谢谢您的宝贵意见！","A very good hotel, it is very standardized that the restaurant should not be planted. The restaurant should not be. I do n’t know why. Hotel feedback on April 17, 2008: The restaurant has been renovated, and the dining environment is much better than before.Thank you for your precious opinions!"
0,"最大的优势是距火车站很近,坐公交去龙门石窟、关林庙等景点十分方便。宾馆设施太陈旧，电视效果差。","The biggest advantage is that it is very close to the train station. It is very convenient to take a bus to Longmen Grottoes and Guanlin Temple.The hotel facilities are too old, and the TV effect is poor."
1,"房间感觉不错,就是入住是花费的时间较长,前台说是房间还没有收拾好.补充点评2008年8月14日：门童真的是很勤快!","The room feels good, that is, it takes a long time to take care of it. The front desk said that the room has not been cleaned up. Supplementary comment on August 14, 2008: Men Tong is really diligent!"
0,像是仓库改的拖鞋不错卫生间还可以早餐很差,"Like the warehouse's slippers are good, the bathroom can still be bad breakfast"
1,服务还不错，但是客房装修过于陈旧，隔音效果确实不好。另外想要对客房部替个意见，你们能不能在客人没有要求清理的情况下，于顾客离店后在进行清理客房呢？最后说一句“真的不要对早餐抱有太大的希望！”,"The service is not bad, but the room decoration is too old, and the sound insulation effect is really not good.In addition, if you want to make an opinion on the guest room department, can you clean up the guest room after the customer leaves the store without asking for cleaning?Finally, ""Don't have too much hope for breakfast!"""
1,"酒店设施相对4星稍显陈旧,而且上网要另外收费不合理,不过服务员是我见过最热情的了,不但跑了三楼(我坐电梯,但是电梯门坏了,她出去摆弄,门就关上了)给我开门,还进门帮我开热水,还帮我往水壶里装水,真是热情到....早餐不是自助的,10元的早餐没什么可吃的,只能是填饱肚子了,性价比一般!","The hotel facilities are slightly old than 4 stars, and the online fees are unreasonable, but the waiter has seen the most enthusiastic one. Not only did I run the third floor (I took the elevator, but the door of the elevator was broken. She went out and fiddled with the door.Close it) Open the door for me, and go to the door to help me open hot water, and help me install water in the kettle. It is really enthusiastic ... breakfast is not a buffet. There is nothing to eat for breakfast for 10 yuan.The belly, the cost -effectiveness is average!"
1,帮我朋友订的豪华大床房，没想到到了那里竟然免费升级到套房，3个人3间套房！！他们美死了，酒店硬件设施超赞的，我以后也要去体验体验！,"I helped my friend's luxurious bedroom, but I didn't expect to upgrade to the suite for free, 3 people 3 suites!IntersectionThey are so beautiful, the hotel's hardware facilities are superb, I will experience experience in the future!"
1,不错的酒店，尤其是服务，是商务客的理想选择。,"Good hotels, especially services, are ideal choices for business customers."
1,"前几次和朋友一起住过这家酒店,总体感觉还不错停车很方便.这次到宜宾还是选择住这里.酒店的地理位置较好,交通便捷,周边较热闹。晚上旁边有烧烤，吃住都很方便。大堂装修还可以，房间略显陈旧，服务质量还将就。","I have lived with this hotel a few times before, and I feel that it is very convenient to stop. I still choose to live here in Yibin.There are barbecue next to the night, and it is convenient to eat and live.The lobby decoration is okay, the room is slightly old, and the quality of service will be."
1,房间不错，环境好，早餐不错，就是比较吵！,"The room is good, the environment is good, and the breakfast is good, just noisy!"
1,"25-27通过携程订的豪华园景连住3晚.中午到酒店,大堂马上送上欢迎项链,冰毛巾,和非常好喝的饮料.只是由于没有打扫完,让我们等了一个小时.这是我们全家第二次入住万豪,房间打扫得非常干净,我们住的房间可以看到泳池和大海,坐在阳台上望着远处的海,和花园的景色,真的很惬意.酒店的自助早餐很丰盛,12岁以下儿童可以免费,非常适合全家住.由于早餐","25-27 Loose the luxury garden view set by Ctrip for 3 nights.

The room we live in can see the pool and the sea.Breakfast is rich, children under 12 years old can be free, very suitable for the whole family. Because breakfast is breakfast"
0,照片与事实不符，房间太小，昆山实际上有很多酒店比这个好，价格也更便宜，携程的价格在该酒店无优势。,"The photos do not match the facts. The room is too small. In fact, there are many hotels in Kunshan better than this, and the price is cheaper. Ctrip's price has no advantage in the hotel."
1,酒店位置很好，是开发区的标志性建筑。前台服务很快，早餐也过得去。房间不错。唯一是电梯慢。,The hotel location is very good and is the iconic building of the development zone.The front desk service is very fast and breakfast has passed.The room is good.The only is the slow elevator.
1,"不是第一次入住了,感觉还不错,要不然不会第二次选择,早餐的品种少了些.其他还好.","It ’s not the first time to stay, it feels good, otherwise it wo n’t choose for the second time. There are fewer breakfast varieties. Others are okay."
1,"我是2月18日入住中远酒店的，我觉得400的价位性价比非常高,酒店可能刚装修过,大堂虽小,但非常干净,也很有品位．由于刚过春节,红灯笼和楼梯上彩条都还在，很喜庆．房间不大，但在香港应该也就不算小了．很干净，这一点我最满意，每天换开水，换新拖鞋，前台服务员很热情的向我们介绍公交线路，公交非常方便，１８路、１８P、104、113、5路都会停在酒店门前，还有电车站也在门前，到中环等繁华。唯一有点不如意之处是床太短了，我老公1.75的个子，一伸腿脚就到了床沿，个子高高的人士有些委屈的。总体来说是满意的","I stayed at the Zhongyuan Hotel on February 18th. I think the price of 400 is very cost -effective. The hotel may have just been renovated. Although the lobby is small, it is very clean and very tasteful.As the Spring Festival has just passed, the red lanterns and the color bar on the stairs are still here, which is very festive.The room is not large, but it should not be small in Hong Kong.Very clean, I am most satisfied with this. Change the water every day and change the new slippers. The front desk waiter introduces us the bus lines. The bus is very convenient.There is also a tram station in front of the door to other prosperity such as Central.The only thing that was a bit unsatisfactory was that the bed was too short. My husband was 1.75, and when he stretched his legs and feet to the edge of the bed, a tall person was a bit aggrieved.Overall is satisfied"
0,估计是出差这个月住的酒店里面最差的了酒店，可以说甚至连如家之类都不如，价格是328，含早餐，开始给个9楼，打开电梯就知道错了，脏兮兮的地毯，房间门破破烂烂，还打不开，撤！下面前台的还问怎么了，后来要给我升级到高级间，先看看，哎呀，还是差，但是时间已经快6点了，路面又下雪，还有其他事办，将就吧，晚上回来马桶是漏水的，还是热水，坐上去，蒸汽腾腾，屁股湿湿，第一次，浴室东西很一般，老的掉牙的酒店，特别讨厌前台的服务员，没有一点服务意思，以后不敢再住这家酒店，携程话务员还要说是星级好酒店，就知道骗钱,"It is estimated that the worst hotel in the hotel where you live in a business trip this month. It can be said that even the family is not as good as home. The price is 328, including breakfast, and start to give a 9th floor. Open the elevator.The door of the room was broken and could not be opened, withdrawing!I asked what happened in the front desk below. Later, I would upgrade to the high level.

1,总体感觉还不错，就是从机场到酒店不是很方便，需要坐机场大巴，下车之后还打的（走的话还是有点距离的）。就这个价位而言，房间还算可以。就是商务中心的工作人员下班太早了，如果可以在晚上也接受我们的订票需要，那就会方便很多。宾馆反馈2008年4月15日：酒店反馈2008年4月8日：感谢阁下的宝贵意见，我们将考虑延长商务中心的服务时间，为客人提供更多的便利。,"The overall feels good, that is, it is not very convenient to get from the airport to the hotel. You need to take the airport bus. After getting off the bus, you can still play (if you leave, it is a bit distance).In this price, the room is okay.That is, the staff of the business center is too early to get off work. If we can accept our booking needs at night, it will be much more convenient.Hotel feedback on April 15, 2008: Hotel feedback on April 8, 2008: Thanks to your valuable opinions, we will consider extending the service time of the business center to provide customers with more convenience."
0,不想多说，酒店所有的条件都很差，以后再也不会入住该酒店！,"I don't want to say more, all the conditions of the hotel are poor, and I will never stay in the hotel in the future!"
0,这家宾馆房间、服务都非常差，前台接待人员像和人有仇一样，一点笑容都没有，早餐说是到9点钟，可8点中去饭已经是冰凉的，问服务人员有没有热的，人家却是一幅爱吃不吃的样子，让我们很不舒服。房间还有一股发霉的味道。真不知道携程为什麽会和这家合作，再也不住这家，劝大家也不要去。,"The room and services of this hotel are very poor. The front desk reception staff is like hate as others, and there is no smile at all. The breakfast is at 9 o'clock, but it is cold to go to meals at 8 o'clock.In this way, people look like they like to eat or make us uncomfortable.There is also a moldy taste in the room.I really do n’t know why Ctrip cooperates with this one, and I can no longer live in this one, and I advise everyone not to go."
1,入住此酒店很值，只能这样概括性评价了：温馨、舒适、有特色。服务得体到位。挂牌四星级酒店嘛！！！,"It is worth checking in this hotel, and it can only be evaluated in this way: warm, comfortable, and distinctive.The service is decent.Listed at a four -star hotel!IntersectionIntersection"
1,定的是2007.10.6的高级大床房一早就到达酒店，办理了checkin手续（当然钥匙还是要等14：00以后才能拿），这样的就可以把行李寄存在酒店，然后到香江动物园等各处游玩，一直到晚上看完烟花才回酒店领钥匙入住。房间的电视遥控器外壳已经不能闭合，让服务员换了；床单发现有已经洗不掉的脏痕，而且穿了几个洞，也让服务员换，结果挑了三张才找到既不烂也不脏的。其余还不错。900元的房价感觉稍贵了点，加上周围景区50元一份超贵的快餐，还不如到香港住一晚。,"The high -end large bed room with 2007.10.6 arrived at the hotel early in the morning and went through the Checkin procedures (of course the key still had to wait 14:00 to get it). In thisPlayed, and went back to the hotel's key until I watched the fireworks at night.The TV remote control shell in the room cannot be closed, so that the waiter has been changed; the sheets find that there are dirty marks that cannot be washed away, and wearing a few holes, which also allows the waiter to change it.Dirty.The rest is not bad.The house price of 900 yuan feels a bit more expensive. In addition, it is better to stay in Hong Kong for one night."
1,还有，前台服务人员培训需改善，速度慢，表情呆滞，有些忙乱。把我的房费刷成美金，虽然退了。但是我的20000元预授权竟然没有帮我取消，打电话三次未果。希望这方面能有所改善。,"In addition, the training of the front desk staff needs to be improved, the speed is slow, the expression is sluggish, and it is a bit busy.Brushing my room fee into US dollars, although I retired.But my pre -authorization of 20,000 yuan did not cancel me, and the call was unsuccessful.Hope to improve this aspect."
1,在西宁应该说是不错的酒店，4星级。我住的商务房很宽敞，也比较干净。服务质量还不错。早餐一般。地理位置也可以。就是价钱（501元）在西宁显得高了点。整体看来基本满意。,"In Xining, it should be said to be a good hotel, 4 stars.The business house I live in is very spacious and clean.The quality of service is not bad.Breakfast is average.Geographical location is also available.The price (501 yuan) looks a bit higher in Xining.Overall perspective is basically satisfied."
0,位置不是很好，离泰山脚下比较远。房间3楼不靠街道的那面较好，虽然后面有市场，但是双窗，关闭后噪音还好。靠街道面的噪音很大，特别是二楼。附近吃饭的地方很少。,"The position is not very good, far from the foot of Taishan.It is better to do not rely on the street on the third floor of the room. Although there is a market in the back, the noise is okay after the double window.The noise on the street is very noise, especially on the second floor.There are very few places to eat nearby."
1,和名字很符合，快捷就是快捷，设施非常简单如果不是holidayinn的话，这个价格就贵的离谱了早餐丰盛选择它的原因是旁边有个火车票代售点对于坐火车的人很方便,"It is very consistent with the name, fast is fast, and the facilities are very simple. If it is not Holidayinn, this price is outrageous. The reason why there is a train ticket sales point next to it is very convenient for those who take the train."
1,国际大酒店订不到房间，抱着试试的态度订了这家感觉还是很不错的，环境也不错尤其床和被子，真的很舒服，比国际的好得多唯一的缺点是地点有点偏,"The international hotel can't book a room. I still feel very good to book this family with a trial attitude. The environment is also good, especially the bed and quilt. It is really comfortable. The only disadvantage than the international ones is that the location is a bit biased."
1,我订的是豪华标准间，478元一晚的，是在20楼的，非常安静，房间也很大，有1张五尺的和1张1.2米的床，屋内基本设备都还行。早餐是送的，双人的，内容还算丰富。入住和签退速度都非常快，这点不错。就是门口服务生对酒店附近以及大连的情况都不是很了解，希望改进。酒店价格略贵了点。补充点评2008年7月11日：酒店离星海广场也很近，出租车10元就到了。到老虎滩大概22元钱。酒店出门忘右走，500米就到繁华地带了，shoppingmall，家乐福。宾馆反馈2008年7月14日：您好！首先感谢您对本酒店作出的评论，您让我们看到了自身的不足，我们会努力改进，愿我们周到、热情、个性化的服务给您带来家的温馨，期待您再次光临时能够给我们提出宝贵意见，谢谢！,"I booked a luxury standard room, 478 yuan a night, on the 20th floor, very quiet, the room is very large, there are 1 five feet and 1 1.2 meter bed, the basic equipment in the house is okay.Breakfast is given, double people, the content is quite rich.The speed of check -in and signing is very fast, which is good.The waiter at the door does not know much about the situation near the hotel and Dalian, and hopes to improve.The hotel's price is slightly more expensive.Supplementary comment on July 11, 2008: The hotel is very close to Xinghai Plaza, and the taxi is 10 yuan.About 22 yuan to the tiger beach.The hotel goes out and goes right, and it will reach the bustling area in 500 meters, Shoppingmall, Carrefour.Hotel feedback on July 14, 2008: Hello!First of all, thank you for your comments on the hotel. You let us see our own shortcomings. We will work hard to improve. We hope that our thoughtful, enthusiastic and personalized service will bring you the warmth of the home.

1,住的是680元一晚的标准间，我与老婆都住的很开心。我们这趟从兰州去嘉峪关再来到敦煌，只有这家的服务达到4、5星级酒店水平，很亲切，也很主动。从房间能看见鸣沙山，景观一流。餐厅食物一般。自助早餐是中式为主，比较一般。零点早餐（也已含）是在酒店的天台餐厅用餐，是西式为主，我们没时间享用，可能会好些，不过我们曾经在这餐厅的露天范围喝酒，晚上看着头顶亮的想去了大漠的星星，感觉非常不错。酒店算是在郊区，但其实就离市区3公里，离夜市4-5公里而已，可是一般很少出租车经过。倒是有辆3路公交车在酒店门口有站，每5分钟一趟，10分钟就到市区，所以也不是很不方便。补充点评2008年8月8日：上网速度就比较差，不过免费的，就没太多要求。,"I lived at the standard room of 680 yuan a night, and my wife and I lived well.We came from Lanzhou to Jiayuguan and then came to Dunhuang. Only this service reached the level of 4 or 5 star hotels. It was very kind and proactive.From the room, you can see Mingsha Mountain, with first -class landscapes.Food food is average.Buffet breakfast is mainly Chinese -based, which is more average.The zero breakfast (also included) is a meal at the hotel's rooftop restaurant. It is mainly Western -style. We have no time to enjoy it. It may be better, but we used to drink in the open -air range of this restaurant.The stars, it feels very good.The hotel is considered to be in the suburbs, but it is actually 3 kilometers away from the city and 4-5 kilometers from the night market, but it is generally rarely passed by taxis.There is a 3 bus at the door of the hotel, every 5 minutes, and 10 minutes to the urban area, so it is not very inconvenient.Supplementary comment on August 8, 2008: The speed of Internet access is relatively poor, but there are not many requirements for free."
1,"普通标房居然不能看凤凰卫视台等境外节目,第一次感觉是不错的,早餐偏简","Ordinary standard houses can not watch overseas programs such as Phoenix Satellite TV. The first time I feel good, breakfast is brief"
1,房间超大又便宜，唯离市区有点远，附近能吃饭的地方少，比较不方便。倒是服务人员服务态度不错。,"The room is large and cheap, but it is a bit far from the urban area. There are fewer places nearby, which is inconvenient.The service staff has a good service attitude."
0,一直都介绍客户到这家酒店公寓，由于地理位置比较方便接送，临近苏州乐园，环境也比较好，像家一样的感觉，总体比较满意。直到最近遇到一些问题，让我有所怀疑是不是我的判断出了错。提出问题的是国外总部的CEO，房间没办法上网，第一天晚上因为要在12点前给加拿大发一个文件，晚餐后不得不早早回到房间工作，结果却上不了网，只好打电话沟通解释，忙到深夜。第二天回来询问了上网的密码和操作，前台翻了半天账册，打印出一张A4纸大小的说明，简单看了一下，发现需要建立连接，设置电脑，步骤及其复杂，略懂电脑的我都要有点担心操作不来。结果第三天，老板无精打采的告诉我他还是没法连接到网络。并且，告诉我下次不要再订这里了。我觉得在这样的情形下，真的很没有面子。在退房时酒店解释说有部分的房间可以直接上网，部分的需要手工设置，我真的很无奈，难道就不能事先说明吗？尤其是老外，电脑是意大利文的，设置起来又要懂电脑，又要懂语言，就不能不自找麻烦，给安排直接可以上网的房间？建议早点建立WIFI连接，彻底解决这个问题。当然，他不愿意住在这里还有其他的原因，他对于入住时要刷卡多押一天房费十分不满，他说他去过很多国家，唯独在中国会有酒店（当然不是所有的酒店，有的只押个卡号）这样去做，因为这样做是对人格的极大不信任，在发达国家决不会在入住时要求刷卡，或押现金，而且是远超过房价的金额。虽然我解释说，这是惯例，不管对中国人还是外国人都一样，决不是对外国人的歧视，但是心理还是觉得很不舒服，因为我们观念的落后，或是信用的落后。由于工作需要，要求延住一天时，酒店再次要求补刷差额，这次只要求加一天的房价，也许是我们的不满给了酒店人员太大的压力，他最后说也可以不用刷了，这时我真的发火了，难道规则是随便定的，随便执行的？可以刷也可以不刷，这算什么？？？卡都拿出来了，就这样收回去，恐怕老板的怒气也要再次被激起，于是又刷了500。结账时，问题又来了。手里有两张签单，由于费用超过第一张签单3元钱，于是被要求再刷一次1500，解释是不能消费超过授权，其余的3元从另外一张授权中刷。或者可以给现金3元。望着手里的1500元授权，500授权和1500消费，3元消费，老外几乎绝望了，实在搞不懂这么简单的事情居然被弄得这么复杂。他所能做的就是下次不再来找麻烦了。,"Customers have always introduced customers to this hotel apartment. Because the geographical location is relatively easy to pick up and drop off, near Suzhou Paradise, the environment is also better. It feels like home and is generally satisfied.Until I encountered some problems recently, I doubted whether my judgment was wrong.What asked the question was the CEO of the foreign headquarters. The room could not go online. On the first night, I had to send a document to Canada before 12 o'clock. I had to return to the room early after dinner, but I couldn't get on the Internet. I had to call to communicate.Explanation, busy until late at night.I came back the next day and asked the password and operation of the Internet. The front desk turned a half -day account book and printed an instructions for the size of A4 paper. Take a brief look.I have to worry about not being able to operate.As a result, on the third day, the boss told me that he could not connect to the Internet.And, tell me not to book here next time.I think in this situation, I really have no face.When checking out, the hotel explained that some rooms can be directly surrounded by the Internet. Some need to set up manual settings. I really have helplessness. Can't I explain in advance?Especially for foreigners, the computer is Italian. If you set it up, you must understand the computer and understand the language.It is recommended to establish a WIFI connection earlier to completely solve this problem.Of course, there are other reasons for him to live here. He is very dissatisfied with the one -day room fee for swiping the card during the check -in. He said that he has been to many countries, but there will be hotels in China (of course, not all hotels, not all hotels.Some are only pledged a card number) to do this, because this is a great distrust of personality. In developed countries, it will never request a card or cash when they stay, and it is far more than the amount of house prices.Although I explained that this is a convention, whether it is the same for Chinese or foreigners, it is by no means discrimination against foreigners, but psychological is still uncomfortable, because our concept is backward or the credit is backward.Due to the needs of work, the hotel once again required to make up the difference when it was required to delay for one day. This time, only one day's house price was required. Maybe it was our dissatisfaction that gave the hotel staff too much pressure.I really got angry at the time, is the rules set casually and execute casually?Can be brushed or not brushed. What is this?IntersectionIntersectionThe card was taken out, and I just retracted it like this. I am afraid that the boss's anger would be excited again, so I brushed 500 again.At the time of checkout, the problem came again.There are two signing orders in your hand. Because the cost exceeds the first sign of 3 yuan, he was asked to brush 1500 again. The explanation was that the consumption could not exceed the authorization. The remaining 3 yuan was brushed from another license.Or you can give cash 3 yuan.Looking at the 1500 yuan authorization in your hand, 500 authorization and 1500 consumption, 3 yuan consumption, foreigners are almost desperate, and they really don't understand such a simple thing.All he can do is to stop looking for trouble next time."
1,我们一家三口第二次去三亚，上次住三亚，这次选择亚龙湾。感觉非常好。服务员都很有礼貌、热情。房间舒适，双床房的床基本够大，不用加床了。天天泡在海边，爽！,"Our family of three went to Sanya for the second time, last time I lived in Sanya, and chose Along Bay this time.It feels very good.The waiters are very polite and enthusiastic.The room is comfortable, the bed in the double bed is basically large enough, no need to add bed.Soak on the sea every day, cool!"
1,"比较满意,没有那么恐怖,一个晚上还是可以的.骚扰电话倒是一个没有....貌似整改过?那天晚上我去的比较晚,没有水果了,所以就送我3瓶小矿泉水,还有2小袋雀巢咖啡....整体来说,还算过","More satisfied, not so scary, it is still possible in one night. The harassment phone is not ... It seems to have rectified it? I went to the night that night, there was no fruit, so I sent me 3 bottles of small mineral water2 Small bags of Nestlé coffee .... Overall, it's pretty too much"
1,地理位置很好，在房间的窗户看杭州夜景很美。交通非常方便，四通八达。服务态度也还可以。就是房间里的装修有些旧，尤其是电视机卫生间洗澡的水龙头很旧真怕弄坏了。房间里的东西买的也很贵。,"The geographical location is very good, and the night view of Hangzhou is beautiful in the window of the room.The transportation is very convenient, and it is in all directions.The service attitude is okay.That is, the decoration in the room is a bit old, especially when the dragon's faucet bathing in the TV toilet is very old and afraid of damaging.The things in the room are also very expensive."
0,10月2日入住单人间。因为是自驾，手边没有延吉地图，就打电话到酒店总台问路，晕的是酒店前台小姐居然说不知道，连周边有什么标志性建筑也说不出，让自己找个出租车带路，没办法自己找吧。而后来证实当地司机只知世纪酒店，也不认识黄金星（该酒店由世纪酒店改名而来）。其实老远就能看见屋顶世纪酒店的大字，早知道就不用乱转圈了。酒店和办公混为一体，没有门僮。可能是通过携程定的关系，感觉给的是最差的房间。我订单上注明要高楼层的房间，但给的仍是最低的十楼（10楼以下是办公楼）房间，两个字：大，脏。房间是我住过的最大的，地毯极脏，还有瓜子壳，卫生间没有浴缸和冲淋房，水直接流地上，一洗澡满地水。房间电话的快捷键没有一个是拨的通的，找不到服务员，也没找到电话簿，奔波了一天，懒得再下楼跟他们理论，所以作罢。唯一欣慰的是床尚算干净，凑合了一晚。很奇怪这样的酒店居然能称为四星，不知哪家机构给评的。,"Check in a single room on October 2.Because it was self -driving, there was no Map of Yanji at hand, so I called the hotel's head station to ask the road. The lady of the hotel at the front desk of the hotel said she did n’t know.No way to find it yourself.Later, it was confirmed that the local driver only knew the Century Hotel and did not know Golden Star (the hotel was renamed by the Century Hotel).In fact, you can see the big words of the roof Century Hotel. If you know it, you don't have to turn around.The hotel and the office are mixed in one, and there are no children.It may be that through the relationship between Ctrip, it feels the worst room.My order indicates that the rooms on the high floors are required, but the room is still the lowest on the tenth floor (below the 10th floor). Two words: big, dirty.The room is the biggest that I have lived. The carpet is very dirty, as well as melon seed shells. There is no bathtub and punching room in the bathroom. The water flows directly on the ground.None of the shortcut keys in the room phone were allocated. They couldn't find the waiter and did not find the phone book. After a day, they were too lazy to go downstairs to the theory with them, so they stopped.The only gratitude was that the bed was clean and made up for a night.It is strange that such a hotel can be called four stars, and I do n’t know which institution has given it."

0,"实在对不起四星的称呼!12月份在2--14度的气温下,只在晚上8点后才开空调!下半夜又关闭!投诉后还有理说是响应政府号召:节约能耗.这样的HOTEL朋友们您还敢入住吗?","I'm really sorry for the name of the four stars! In December at the temperature of 2--14 degrees, only the air conditioner was turned on after 8pm! The next night was closed again!

1,还行，就跟网友说的一样，地毯比较脏。但临安小地方有这样一个地方不错了。,"Okay, just like netizens, the carpet is dirty.But there is such a place in Lin'an small."
1,"该酒店位于新宁广场旁,交通购物都很方便.房间干净整洁.酒店的服务比其他大城市的四星酒店要差一些.首先我入住时在13:30左右服务台只有1位服务员忙的不亦乐乎,等了10分种左右才入住.房间的迷你吧台空空,四星酒店应有免费瓶装水.希望酒店加强服务.","The hotel is located next to Xinning Plaza, which is very convenient for transportation and shopping. The room is clean and tidy. The hotel's service is worse than the four -star hotels in other big cities. First of all, when I stayed at 13:30, only one waiter was busy.I am very happy, wait for 10 points to check in. The mini bar of the room is empty, and the four -star hotel should have free bottle water. I hope the hotel will strengthen the service."
1,酒店设施和服务都不错，满意。酒店地处较偏，但当地物价便宜，打的出去也挺方便的。,"Hotel facilities and services are good and satisfied.The hotel is located, but the local price is cheap, and it is very convenient to go out."
0,这个酒店实在太差，房间设施和二星级的差不多。淋浴间真是有些脏，地上全是一块一块的黑点点，也不知道是些啥东东。一次性的拖鞋包装已经被折掉，有一点点脏，好象已经被用过。还好那次刚好自带了一次性拖鞋，否则要穿着高帮鞋在房间里走来走去了，想起来就让人不舒服。前台小姐也是面无表情，像人家欠她钱一样。前台距离房间实在有些远，是极不方便的。空调的声音很大，还有即使开到了三十度都感觉不到暖气，幸好网线有些长，可以坐在床上用电脑，,"This hotel is too bad, the room facilities are similar to the two -star.The shower room is really dirty, and the ground is full of black dots on the ground, and I don't know what Dongdong is.Disposable slippers packaging has been folded and a little dirty, as if it has been used.Fortunately, I just took a one -time slippers at that time, otherwise I would walk around in the room wearing high -top shoes.Miss front desk is also expressionless, just like people owe her money.The front desk is a bit far from the room, which is extremely inconvenient.The sound of the air conditioner is very loud, and even if it turns to 30 degrees, I can't feel the heating. Fortunately, the network cable is a bit long. You can sit on the bed with a computer."
0,"1,交通离石龙路地铁站步行10分钟，算是比较方便。2、房价和屋内设施不太相符，屋内设备太简陋。3、商务电脑上网还要5元/小时。总值，感觉性价比不好。","1. Traffic from Shilong Road Metro Station for 10 minutes, which is more convenient.2. Housing prices are not in line with the house facilities, and the equipment inside the house is too simple.3. It takes 5 yuan/hour to access the Internet on the Internet.The total value, the cost -effectiveness is not good."

0,刚为朋友29号预定的北方担心过，不料30号结房时，前台问我朋友房间的有线电视摇控器不见了，后来在我强烈要求下，酒店人员可能动用百度搜索到摇控器，这才罢休！我就纳闷了：我怎么就这么倒霉啊？每次预定北方都会有麻烦，我想这不是偶然吧，北方的前台服务真的有待提高。,"I was worried about the northern booked for my friend on the 29th. Unexpectedly, when the house was closed on the 30th, the front desk asked my friend's room to be a cable shook controller. Later, at my strong request, the hotel staff may use Baidu to search the controller.Then he stopped!I wondered: Why are I so unlucky?There will be trouble every time you are scheduled to be in the north. I think this is not accidental. The front desk service in the north needs to be improved."

1,环境不错，但是当我下午去住的时候，居然订的三间房一间都没打扫。,"The environment is good, but when I stayed in the afternoon, I did not clean up the three rooms."
1,我住过很多次，有一次住了商务套间，巨大。感觉用不了这么大的面积。在平湖来说这里算不错了，早餐需要改进。,"I have lived many times and once lived in a business suit, huge.I don't feel so large.In Pinghu, this is good, and breakfast needs to be improved."
0,不建议大家去住，只有后悔。首都的服务啊，给全国人丢人现眼。,"It is not recommended that everyone live, only regret.The service of the capital is shameful to the whole country."
0,"这是我住过的最糟糕的所谓的4星酒店!酒店的装修很粗糙，我住的大床房,很硬.地毯很脏，大片的污渍。卫生间洗澡的喷头喷出的水打在身上要多难受有多难受!酒店特别靠近马路,早晨想睡个懒觉早早就被吵醒了.我不知道他们的星级是怎么评的,要我说连三星都不算!不如住如家。","This is the worst so -called 4 -star hotel I have lived! The hotel's decoration is very rough. The big bed room I live in is very hard. The carpet is dirty and large stains.How uncomfortable the water sprayed on the spray head of the bathroom bathing! The hotel is particularly close to the road, and I want to sleep in the morning and be awakened. I don’t know how their stars are evaluated.It is not even a Samsung! It is better to live as home."
1,房间不错，尤其是床一张大一张小，适合三口之家入住。服务台的小姐很热情，自助餐也不错，就性价比而言还可以。,"The rooms are good, especially the bed is small, suitable for the family of three.The lady on the service desk is very enthusiastic, and the buffet is also good, and it is okay for cost -effectiveness."
0,首先酒店所在位置很隐蔽，看样子是网上订单的客人比较多，价格便宜，相对的房间硬件设施和服务就差些。我房子的空调竟然是个二手的。上面还贴着大头照。前台对你也爱理不理的。如果囊中羞涩可以考虑该酒店，否则还是去别处吧。第二天换的那个不远的天财酒店还不错。价格也合理328元,"First of all, the location of the hotel is very hidden. It seems that there are more guests in online orders. The price is cheap. The relative room hardware facilities and services are worse.The air conditioner in my house turned out to be a second -hand.There are still big head photos on it.The front desk is ignored by you.If you are shy, you can consider the hotel, otherwise go elsewhere.The not far from the day the next day is not bad.The price is also reasonable 328 yuan"
0,服务一般，房价相对太高，房间不满意，有味还比较脏.......最要命的是服务员没有经过训练，一点没有服务意识，态度恶劣！！！！！！！！,"The service is general, the house prices are relatively high, the room is not satisfied, the taste is more dirty .....

It was 258 during the Spring Festival, including early"
1,闹中带静，虽然离四方街不远，但房间还是挺安静。里面的装修看得出很花心思，挺有味道的，房间和洗手间虽然不算大，但挺舒服干净的，服务员很友善热情。我是住在二楼，可以看到古城的大部分，感觉还是很不错，不过觉得价位稍稍贵了点。,"The noise is quiet, although not far from Sifang Street, the room is still quite quiet.The decoration inside can see very much and tasteful. Although the room and the bathroom are not large, they are quite comfortable and clean. The waiters are very friendly and enthusiastic.I live on the second floor and I can see most of the ancient city. It feels very good, but I feel that the price is slightly more expensive."
1,酒店各个方面总体来说在晋城还是算不错。就是房间里上网时不时断网，一会儿又自动联上。房间里的灯光有点昏暗，洗澡间实在有点太小，一个人站在里面都没办法转身，另外，携程的价格不是很有竞争力。,"In all aspects of the hotel, it is generally good in Jincheng.It is the internet disconnected from time to time when the room surfes the Internet, and it will be connected automatically in a while.The lights in the room were a bit dim, and the bathroom was a bit too small. One person couldn't turn around in it. In addition, Ctrip's price was not very competitive."
1,此次（第N+1次）入住，虽然本人预先已经而且是特意在携程的订单上注明“请务必通知酒店在房间内为本人准备一个行李架”，但办理入住手续的时候还是发现酒店并没有准备好。。。所幸前台一个名叫Angela的美丽经理及时做了妥善处理，本人比较满意，在此也对其（请注意，是对Angela本人，而不是对酒店）表示感谢！,"This time (N+1), although I have already stated on the order of Ctrip in advance, ""Please notify the hotel to prepare a luggage rack for me in the room.""Not ready.EssenceEssenceFortunately, a beautiful manager named Angela was properly handled in time. I am more satisfied. Here I also thanks to Angela, not the hotel)!"
1,酒店旁边的那条湖滨中路景色特别的美，出差一般选择这里住，如果酒店能考虑再次装修会更好。,The scenery of the lakeside in the hotel is particularly beautiful. It is generally selected here to stay here. It would be better if the hotel can consider renovation again.
1,第一次入住此酒店，订房间前看到大家的点评，说是早餐好吃就决定了。入住的感觉还好，前台及客房的服务员态度很好，又有笑容，就是结账有些慢，望能够提高工作效率。早餐确实好吃，连住几日，都有一定的更改，就是水果的品种有些少。房间能上网很好，但速度太慢，不知是否能够将容量增大，否则很难工作。另外，大堂中不花钱能够等人的空间过小，中间一大部分都是咖啡厅，做生意。就有几张椅子放在一边，有些憋屈。建议能够将一部分咖啡厅开放出来，做一个较大的休息空间。,"Check in this hotel for the first time, and see everyone's comments before booking the room, saying that it is delicious for breakfast.It feels good to stay in. The waiter in the front desk and the guest rooms is very good, and there is a smile. It is a bit slow to check out. It is hoped that it can improve work efficiency.Breakfast is really delicious. Even for a few days, there are some changes, that is, there are few fruits.The room can access the Internet, but the speed is too slow. I wonder if it can increase the capacity, otherwise it is difficult to work.In addition, the space of not spending money in the lobby is too small, and most of them are cafes in the middle to do business.There are a few chairs on one side, a little aggrieved.It is recommended to open some cafes to make a larger rest space."
1,"感觉还可以,就是二层楼房窗外没有风景,被一些建筑物遮挡,可能是广告之类,晚上还可以,有窗帘,白天就不能恭维了.在网上订的,写着有水果赠送,因为还有同事,夸口有水果赠送,结果到房间后根本没有,好没面子,后来催了两次,总算送了过来.总台服务态度特别好.","It feels okay. There is no scenery outside the window on the second floor. It is blocked by some buildings. It may be advertisements and the like. At night, there are curtains. You can't compliment it during the day.There are colleagues who boast of fruit gifts. As a result, there was no at all after arriving at the room. There was no face. Later, I urged it twice. Finally, I sent it over."
1,如果是我一个人再到东莞出差的话，我还会住在东莞宾馆，但是如果我和我的老板一起来东莞的话，可能会住到索菲特去。我喜欢东莞宾馆的环境和它的几个餐厅，身处闹市但是却很安静，很舒服，宾馆的服务也很到位。对于普通的商务旅行者来说，东莞宾馆的标准间是最物超所值的。,"If I go to Dongguan for a business trip alone, I will still live in Dongguan Hotel, but if I come to Dongguan with my boss, I may live in Sofitt.I like the environment of Dongguan Hotel and several restaurants in it. I am in a downtown, but I am very quiet and comfortable. The hotel's service is in place.For ordinary business travelers, the standard room of Dongguan Hotel is the most worthy of money."
1,交通方便，房间比较干静宽敞，总体来讲还说得过去。,"The transportation is convenient, the room is relatively quiet and spacious, and generally speaking."
1,"酒店的大堂太小,装修也感觉比较旧了.服务人员态度不是好,最后还是找的一个外国服务生办理入住,感觉比中国服务生态度要好.总体感觉起来不像是五星反而像四星宾馆.两个人才送一个巧克力,唉,,也不至于这么小气吧,中间服务生打扫房间之后特意把依云矿泉水放在床头醒目的位置,目的就不用说了,洗漱用具是三星级标准...","The lobby of the hotel is too small, and the decoration also feels older. The attitude of the service staff is not good. In the end, a foreign waiter who was looking for was better than the Chinese service. The overall feeling did not feel like a five -star.. The two talents send a chocolate, alas, and it is not so stingy. After the middle waiter cleaned the room, the Yiyun mineral water was specially placed on the eye -catching position of the bedside.standard..."
0,房间巨小，电视成了摆设，开不了，服务员态度冷漠。以后不会再进这家酒店,"The room was small, the TV became a furnishings, and the waiter could not drive. The waiter was indifferent.I won't enter this hotel again in the future"
1,"酒店位于昆明中心区,地理位置不错,可惜酒店服务有些差,第一天晚上可能入住的客人不多,空调根本没开,打了电话问,说是中央空调要晚上统一开,结果晚上也没开,就热了一晚上,第二天有开会的入住,晚上就有了空调,不得不说酒店经济帐作的好.房间的床太硬,睡的不好.酒店的早餐就如其他人评价一样,想法的难吃.不过携程的预订价钱还不错.","The hotel is located in the central area of Kunming. The geographical location is good. Unfortunately, the hotel service is a bit poor. There are not many guests who may stay in the first night. The air conditioner did not open at all.After opening, it was hot for a night, the meeting was checked in the next day, and there was an air conditioner at night. I have to say that the hotel's economic account is good. The bed in the room is too hard and sleeps well.The evaluation is the same, the idea is unpalatable. But Ctrip's booking price is not bad."
1,位于徐家汇中心地段，房价经济实惠，环境也很好呢,"Located in the center of Xujiahui, the house price is economical and the environment is also very good."
1,位置很好，距离东街口非常近，服务也非常好，一路有人引导到房间，泡上乌龙茶。房间有电脑，白天出去工作的时候，老婆正好可以使用。酒店除了家具设施稍微有些过时，早餐比较普通外，其他没有什么缺点。晚上很多形形色色的人往6楼夜总会跑，也有不少人醉醺醺的出来。酒店是最近才升为4星的，不过，个人感觉还是达不到新四星的标准，但至少还是对得起这个价格的。补充点评2008年7月27日：同下面的点评，服务员会主动拿我自己洗的衣服去阳台晒，并留下字条，赞一个。,"The location is very good, it is very close to Dongjiekou, and the service is very good. Someone guided all the way to the room and soaked with oolong tea.There is a computer in the room. When you go out during the day, your wife can just use it.In addition to the a little outdated furniture facilities, the breakfast is more common, and there are no shortcomings.At night, many of the various people ran to the nightclub on the 6th floor, and many people came out of drunk.The hotel has only been promoted to 4 stars recently. However, I feel that I still can't meet the standard of the new four -star, but at least it is still worth the price.Supplementary review July 27, 2008: With the following reviews, the waiter will take the initiative to take the clothes I washed to the balcony, leave a note, and like one."
1,整体还算可以，离市区稍远，环境不错，旁边有公园，酒店提供接机服务，如果有送机服务就更好了（打的到机场20元）,The overall is okay. It is slightly far from the urban area and the environment is good. There is a park next to it. The hotel provides pick -up services.
1,"于其说是点评,不如说是投诉,2008年7月15日晚,我公司一行3人通过携程网预定入住市长大厦,作为广州服务业的知名宾馆,我们对该单位的软件,硬件和服务无可厚非,因为它的价格比起其他的宾馆也是不一般的,但有关该宾馆自定的口头条款用于实际的服务强加给入住客人时,使我们不得不对其星级的服务和档次表示怀疑.事情是这样的,当时一行三人有2位是日本客人,在晚间洗澡时导致入住房间的地毯浸湿,16日离店时由总台值班经理处理此事,提出按照宾馆规定要赔偿一天的营业损失620元,我本人作为客人对此有极大不满和看法:1.首先:赔偿620元的规定只是宾馆的前台人员口头说出并强加给客人,相关的书面规定条款我们没有看到!2.作为广州知名的5星级宾馆,客人入住后有水浸地毯的事实,但宾馆方面没有从自身寻找原因,只是值班经理说通过检查他们的排水系统的硬件没有问题,我给人认为,处理问题最讲究的是要有证据,如只是听从宾馆人员单方面的信口雌黄,能说明问题吗,作为服务行业,难道出了问题更多的是找出没有证据的理由来对客人强加责难和经济惩罚吗?这显然违背了该行业的存在初衷!3.疑问:之所以会有以上的投诉反馈,我们不禁要问:宾馆浴缸在正常的放水时即使有连续的水注入,浴缸上方的溢水孔同样也会及时地排出多余的水,怎么会有水流出呢?原因无非有2种:其一地漏不同或流淌缓慢导致积水溢出卫生间.其二溢水孔是否真的有溢水功效?4.现在的宾馆,诸多都是以自制的霸王条款来约束客人,甚至超越其权限对客人进行经济处罚,这本身就是对""服务""和""星级""的一种亵渎,试想,入住这么高档的酒店,排除极个别的因素外,有那位客人会没事去做这样无聊的事情让其水漫金山呢?况且,入住者还是50几岁的老人!5.最终由于我们赶路的原因,还是作了""妥协"",交了罚款,离店而去,留给外方客人的是对广州市长大厦这种处理问题的方式和态度表示更多的无奈和遗憾,同时更多的是我们中国人对服务行业的国人(抛开政治因素)的这种做法提出反思,是否我们应该改一改了!要知道,简单的口头武断是不能作为评定事实的证据的,要以理服人,以德服人!6.目前为止,对此事我们还保留向有关部门投诉的权力!7.对于该酒店的软硬环境评价,我们还是以公正的心态去评判!毕竟,没有最好,只有更好嘛!","It is a complaint that it is a comment. On the evening of July 15, 2008, three people in our company were scheduled to stay in the city of the city through Ctrip.com as a well -known hotel in the Guangzhou service industry.Service is understandable because its price is also unusual than other hotels, but when the oral terms of the hotel's self -determined service are used to the actual service to the guests, we have to express doubts about its star service and grades.This is the case. At that time, two of the three people were Japanese guests. When bathing in the evening, the carpet in the room was soaked. When leaving the store on the 16th, the general station manager handled the matter.The business loss is 620 yuan. As a guest, I have a great dissatisfaction and opinion on this: 1. First of all: the provisions of the 620 yuan compensation are just the front desk staff of the hotel speaks and imposed to the guests.! 2. As a well -known 5 -star hotel in Guangzhou, the guests have the fact that they have water -immersed carpets after their check -in, but the hotel does not find the reason from themselves, but the manager on duty said that there is no problem with the hardware of their drainage system.The most important thing about dealing with the problem is that there must be evidence. For example, just obeying the unilateral letter of the hotel personnel, can it explain the problem? As a service industry, is it more difficult to find out the reason that there is no evidence to impose responsibilities and difficulties and difficulties in the guests and difficulties.Is economic punishment? This obviously violates the original intention of the existence of the industry! 3. Question: The reason why there will be the above complaint feedback, we can't help asking: even if there is continuous water injection in the bathtub of the hotel, the overflow of the overflow above the bathtub is overflowing.The holes will also discharge excess water in a timely manner. How can there be water flowing? There are two reasons: there are two types of leakage or slow flowing of the stagnant water overflow. Does the second overflow hole really have a spilling effect? 4. 4.Many of the current hotels, many of them are restrained by self -made overlord clauses, and even surpass their authority to impose economic penalties for guests.In addition to excluding extremely individual factors, one guest will do such a boring thing to make it water in the golden mountain? Moreover, the resident is still an old man in his 50s! 5. In the end""Comparative compromise"", fined and left the store, leaving the foreign guests to express more helplessness and regrets about the ways and attitudes of the mayor of Guangzhou Mayor Building. At the same time, we are more Chinese.This approach to the people in the service industry (aside from political factors) reflects on whether we should change it! We must know that simple oral arbitrage cannot be used as evidence of assessing facts.People! 6. So far, we still retain the power of complaining to relevant departments in this matter! 7. For the hotel's hard and hard environmental evaluation, we still judge with a fair attitude! After all"""
1,为客人订的。他比较满意。看来是不错的。出入非常方便。,Ordered for guests.He is more satisfied.It looks good.It is very convenient to enter and exit.
0,通过携程预订了2个单间，结果到了酒店，酒店前台告诉我订的是1个单间和1个标房，强烈交涉后，酒店还是给了我2个单间，但是里面设施极差，一进房门就有浓重的烟味和臭味，电视遥控板是坏的，房间的被子超级薄，不得不把空调开到最大。柜子里塞满了枕头却没有被子，洗手间的下水不畅，洗个澡还堵得地上都是水……唯一值得一提的是早点还不错。总结如下：1.房间预订有问题，携程已经跟我预订2个单间，但是到了酒店却变成1单间1标房；2.该酒店条件太差，根本不符合三星级标准，不建议入住,"I booked 2 single rooms through Ctrip. As a result, when I arrived at the hotel, the hotel front desk told me to book a single room and 1 benchmark. After a strong negotiation, the hotel still gave me 2 single rooms, but the facilities were poor.The door has a strong smoke and odor. The TV remote control board is bad. The quilt in the room is super thin and has to maximize the air conditioner.The cabinet was stuffed with a pillow but no quilt. The launch of the toilet was not smooth, and the bath was blocked by water ... The only thing worth mentioning was that it was not bad.The summary is as follows: 1. There is a problem with the room booking. Ctrip has booked two single rooms with me, but when the hotel is at the hotel, it becomes a single room and 1 standard room;"
1,目前是新昌最好的酒店，环境和服务质量都非常好，国内长度免费和免费宽带还是蛮有吸引力的，离大佛寺仅咫尺之遥，太方便了补充点评2008年5月4日：酒店一楼中餐厅内的白斩鸡和水库剁椒鱼头是不能不尝的？住了两晚，吃了两餐。特色的芋饺和面我看并不一定适合上海人的口味。,It is currently the best hotel in Xinchang. The quality and service quality are very good. The domestic length and free broadband are still quite attractive. It is only a few days away from the Great Buddha Temple.Is the white chopped chicken and reservoir chopped pepper fish head in the restaurant on the first floor?I lived for two nights and had two meals.The characteristic taro dumplings and noodles are not necessarily suitable for Shanghai people.
1,性价比非常好的酒店，房间设施超好，卫生间分了3个部分，淋浴房，卫生间，化妆间，非常干净，装修很有欧式风格，就是枕头不太舒服，一个太低，两个太高。,"The cost -effective hotel, the room facilities are super good, and the bathroom has three parts.

0,这家酒店以前未觉得有什么，最近入住两次非常郁闷。第一次，我定了一天，第二天居然酒店前台经理说不能续住，第一次遇见，携程还帮酒店说话。今天住酒店没有空调，三星级酒店，不可想象，服务员的解决办法就是拿个电风扇给我，超搞笑。携程的工作人员说酒店没有空调没有说法也是正常的。我真不知道携程的佣金是不是拿的有点太轻松了。没有答复的话，抛开酒店不谈，我觉得我对携程信任度也大打折扣。了。,"This hotel did not feel anything before, and it was very depressed twice recently.For the first time, I set up a day, and the next day, the front desk manager of the hotel said that he could not live. For the first time, Ctrip also helped the hotel to speak.There is no air conditioner in the hotel today. Sanxing hotels. Unimaginable. The solution to the waiter is to give me an electric fan. It is super funny.Ctrip's staff said that it is normal for the hotel to have no air conditioning.I really don't know if Ctrip's commission is a bit too easy.If there is no answer, aside from the hotel, I don't think I have greatly reduced the trust in Ctrip.It's right."
1,我于日前入住该酒店，因为去机车厂办事，所以应该是个最近的选择，酒店本身没什么可以说的，硬件较老了，但在我离开之后的一件事让我非常感动。当天我离开酒店后便回到上海，整理行李时发现遗忘了一根数据线在酒店，急忙电话联络总台，是一位张小姐接的电话，经过确认已被保管，便请张小姐帮忙寄回上海，2天后酒店还专门派人来电询问，令我非常感动。酒店的服务真是值得表扬。特别再次表示感谢。,"I stayed at the hotel a few days ago. Because I went to work in the locomotive factory, it should be a recent choice. The hotel itself has nothing to say. The hardware is older, but one thing after I leave has moved me very much.When I left the hotel that day, I returned to Shanghai. When I organized my luggage, I found that I forgotten a data cable in the hotel. I hurriedly phone to contact the head station.After returning to Shanghai, the hotel also sent someone to ask for inquiries 2 days later, which moved me very much.The service of the hotel is really commendable.Thank you especially again."
1,"酒店的设施完全配得上四星了,环境干净整洁,就是游泳池在室外的,不开放.该酒店是缙云最好的酒店了,去仙都游玩的朋友应该首选此酒店.","The hotel's facilities are completely worthy of four stars, and the environment is clean and tidy, that is, the swimming pool is outdoors, and it is not open. The hotel is the best hotel in Yunyun. Friends who go to Xiandu should choose this hotel."
1,服务素质实在一般，酒店也旧，象是回到了二十年前。。。补充点评2008年7月2日：也就给三分，怎么变以4分了？,"The quality of service is really ordinary, and the hotel is also old, as if it was back to 20 years ago.EssenceEssenceSupplementary review July 2, 2008: Give three points, how can I change 4 points?"
1,在这里住过很多次了，每次来肇庆必住这家酒店。设施有点老了，但是面对星湖，交通方便，可以随时感受星湖的碧波和肇庆的人文气息，感觉还是挺不错的。,"I have lived here many times, and every time I come to Zhaoqing, I will stay in this hotel.The facilities are a bit old, but in the face of Xinghu and convenient transportation, you can feel the humanistic atmosphere of Xinghu and Zhaoqing at any time. It feels pretty good."
1,总体来说，还不错。老酒店，是当地最好的之一。挺干净的。餐厅也不错。缺点是离五指山景区太远（有40KM左右，1个多小时车程）。真的要在五指山玩，还是需要选择住在景区附近。,"Overall, it is not bad.Old hotels are one of the best locations.It's very clean.The restaurant is also good.The disadvantage is that it is too far away from the Wuzhishan Scenic Area (with about 40km, more than an hour's drive).I really have to play in Wuzhishan, and still need to choose to live near the scenic area."
0,号称平遥最高级的四星酒店，实际只是二星半的硬件，二十年前国营招待所的服务，差极了。可能因为住客少，房间长期空关，酒店西翼的房间一股霉味，厕所还泛出阵阵臭气。建议坚持要求酒店东翼房间。-酒店不收信用卡，只收现金。住客在餐厅消费不能签单，必须付现金。-酒店提供的洗发波/浴液质量低劣。卫生纸污迹霉斑。强烈推荐自带洗发水、卫生纸，以免飞来横祸。-酒店床上用品“一客一换”，住客不离店不换床单。-早餐极差，基本吃素。-行李生推荐包车服务疯狂宰客。去王家大院包车半天（夏利）来回竟要价400元。我出门上街拦车，才200元（高速通行费来回30元另计），还是桑塔纳2000。不过据说平遥其他的酒店更可怕。打算住在平遥，丽泽苑是无可奈何的选择。,"The four -star hotel, known as Pingyao's highest level, is actually only two and a half stars. The service of the State -owned Guest House twenty years ago was extremely bad.Maybe because there are few residents, the rooms are empty for a long time, the room in the west of the hotel has a moldy smell, and the toilet also sinks.It is recommended to adhere to the hotel's east wing room.-The hotel does not receive credit cards, only cash.Residents cannot sign orders in the restaurant, and they must pay cash.-The quality of shampoo/bath liquid provided by the hotel is poor.Skilled paper stains.It is highly recommended to bring self -shampoo and toilet paper to avoid flying.-The hotel bed supplies ""one guest and one change"", residents do not leave the shop or change the sheets.-The breakfast is extremely poor and basically vegetarian.-The baggage recommended chartered service crazy.Go to the Wangjia Courtyard for a long time (Charlie) and go back and forth for 400 yuan.I went out on the street to stop the car. It was only 200 yuan (30 yuan for high -speed traffic fees), or Santana 2000.However, it is said that other hotels in Pingyao are even more terrible.It is a helpless choice to live in Pingyao."
1,地理位置不错，房间环境也可以，洗衣速度快，值得称赞，唯一不足就是装修期间，很多楼层乱乱的。,"The geographical location is good, the room environment is also available, the washing speed is fast, it is commendable. The only disadvantage is that during the decoration period, many floors are chaotic."
1,"感觉非常不错，尤其喜欢卫生间。很干净，清爽，里面什么都有，感觉不错。不过早上的早餐不是特别好，品种过于单一，不是很丰富。地理位置特别好，楼下就是逛街的地方，还不错。到哪里玩都不远。补充点评2007年11月21日：补充一点：卫生间的水非常大，但是有个缺点是，热水出来太慢。我放冷水放了好久都还不是很热，后来打电话问，回答是要多放一会，大概要10分钟,结果热水真的出来了！可是，那么大的水，10分钟要白白浪费掉多少水啊！太可惜了！实在很浪费水资源的！（声明：淋浴，非盆浴。因为有些房间只有淋浴，也有的客人是不喜欢盆浴的。）希望酒店可以从资源的角度出发，“节能减排”，可以有所改善。谢谢！","It feels very good, especially like the bathroom.Very clean, refreshing, everything inside, it feels good.However, the breakfast in the morning is not particularly good. The variety is too single, not very rich.The geographical location is particularly good, and downstairs is a shopping place, pretty good.It's not far away wherever you play.Supplementary comment on November 21, 2007: One point: The water in the bathroom is very large, but there is a disadvantage that the hot water comes out too slowly.I was not very hot for a long time, and then I called and asked, the answer was to put it for a while, about 10 minutes, the hot water really came out!However, so large water, how much water is wasteful for 10 minutes!What a pity!It's really a waste of water!(Disclaimer: Shower, non -pot baths. Because some rooms only have shower, and some guests do not like pots.) I hope that hotels can start from the perspective of resources. ""Energy saving and emission reduction"" can be improved.Thanks!"
0,为了图交通方便，所以选择了市长大厦。本以为市长大厦是比较新的酒店，可一进门就感觉很失望――大堂超级的小（应该说是没有大堂，大厦外观给人感觉还不错可内部很糟糕）。房间地毯也显陈旧了。更可气的是我在携程网上预订时，看到高级套房是有双人早餐的。可办理入住手续时候，因当时只有我一个人的证件，前台只给了一份早餐券。我提出质疑，前台回答说“必须登记两个人的证件才能给两份早餐券”。我说我住过国内很多家酒店，从没听说过这种无理的要求。而且携程的预订说明上也没有注明这样的规定。前台小姐回答我“我们酒店就是这么规定的”（竟然连句抱歉的话都没有）。真是恶心！印象太差，下次不会再考虑入住该酒店！,"In order to make a convenient traffic, the mayor of the mayor was chosen.I thought the mayor of the mayor was a relatively new hotel, but I felt disappointed when I entered the door -the lobby is super small (it should be said that there is no lobby, the appearance of the building is not bad, but the interior is bad).The rugs of the room are also old.What is even more angry is that when I booked online on Ctrip, I saw that there were double breakfast for high -end suite.When you go through the procedures, because there was only my certificate at the time, only one breakfast coupon was given at the front desk.I asked, and the front desk answered ""the two people's documents must be registered to give two breakfast coupons.""I said that I have lived in many domestic hotels and never heard of this unreasonable requirement.And Ctrip's reservation explanation did not indicate such rules.Miss front desk answered me, ""Our hotel is so stipulated"" (even if there is nothing even if he is sorry).Really disgusting!Impression is too bad, I won't consider staying in the hotel next time!"
1,非常精致温暖的酒店，很有特色，服务也很到位。入住当天去餐厅吃饭，东西很好吃，可是由于高原反应，几乎什么都吃不下，叫服务员打包，结果服务员居然很体贴地说可以放在厨房第二天再热一下吃，还端来了姜茶，赞一个！就是洗澡不大舒服，卫生间太小,"The very delicate and warm hotel is very distinctive and the service is in place.I went to the restaurant for dinner on the day of staying, but because of the altitude reaction, I couldn't eat anything, and the waiter was packaged. As a result, the waiter actually said that he could put it in the kitchen and eat it the next day.Tea, like one!It's not very comfortable to take a bath, and the bathroom is too small"
1,我订的260的房间，还算不错了，住了两晚。是以前政府的接待宾馆，有点老，但是还算可以的，各方面都差不多，不算差，但也不是很好。我感觉床还是比较舒服的。宾馆周围比较繁华，应该是商业区。,"The 260 room I booked was pretty good, I lived for two nights.It was the government's reception hotel. It was a bit old, but it was okay. It was similar in all aspects. It was not bad, but it was not very good.I feel that the bed is still more comfortable.The hotel is relatively prosperous, and it should be a commercial area."
1,酒店单人房间很大，属于一室一厅。虽然装修较旧，但各方面还算不错。早餐也很好，西式的氛围。只是前台的服务稍差。办理入住时就看他一个人在那里白胡了。一点也不专业。,"The hotel's single room is very large, belonging to the one -bedroom and one living room.Although the decoration is older, it is pretty good in all aspects.Breakfast is also good, Western -style atmosphere.It's just a little worse at the front desk.When I handled it, I saw him alone.It is not professional at all."
0,酒店房间装修过了，但是不知道为什不还马桶，洗澡的地方也不分割一下，洗完澡厕所就没法进人了，马桶也会被浇的全是水。晚上回到房间发现竟然中央空调没有启动。打电话服务员说开开窗子就凉快了。靠，马路旁的房间开窗子吵得无法入睡。另一侧的房间，开窗后腥臭味道阵阵袭来，也无法入睡，本计划住两天，第二天一早就退了房。,"The hotel room has been renovated, but I do n’t know why I do n’t return the toilet, and the place where the bath is not divided. The toilet will not be able to enter the toilet, and the toilet will be poured all water.I returned to the room at night and found that the central air conditioner did not start.The call waiter said that the window was cold.Damn, the room next to the road was too noisy to fall asleep.On the other side of the room, the smell of smelly smell after opening the window and could not fall asleep. The plan was planned for two days, and the room was retired early the next morning."
1,我认为本酒店物有所值，离奥运地铁站超近（五分钟的路程），从奥运地铁站B口（往后拐）出来后，等走下楼梯会发现右边有一个很小的路，所谓路也就是两个建筑之间的通道，然后顺着路一直走不用拐弯，就会发现本酒店，酒店的上的醒目名称是“奥运九龙酒店”。酒店是相当的干净，服务人员也很好，唯一的不足就是房间太小，但是香港吗，寸土寸金也是没有办法的事。总起来说相当满意，以后还会入住。,"I think the hotel is worth it, and it is nearly near the Olympic subway station (a five -minute journey). After coming out of the Olympic subway station (turning back), when you go down the stairs, you will find that there is a small road on the right.The so -called road is the channel between the two buildings, and then walk along the road without turning, and you will find that the hotel is ""Olympic Kowloon Hotel"".The hotel is quite clean, and the service staff is very good. The only disadvantage is that the room is too small, but is there no way to Hong Kong, and there is no way to get gold.It's quite satisfied with it, and I will stay in the future."
1,还算是不错的吧，我定的单人间，但房间太小，装修比较有特色，就是灯光有点暗哦，前台服务态度还不错，可以再次选择哦。,"It's not bad, I set a single room, but the room is too small, the decoration is more distinctive, that is, the lights are a bit dark, the front desk service attitude is not bad, you can choose again."
1,房间超大，比一般的标间大很多。有熨烫设备，很人性化。早餐超值。卫生间干湿分离设计，很方便。服务也很好。不足之处是门口打车太不方便，在呼市打车基本靠抢的，而且不给票。门僮也几乎不会给叫车吧（没看到门僮）。另外毛巾有点硬，比包头的海德毛巾差得多。不过在呼市市中心来说还算是最好的了，推荐入住。,"The room is large, which is much larger than the average room.There are ironing equipment, which is very humane.Breakfast value.The dry and wet separation design of the bathroom is very convenient.The service is also very good.The deficiencies are that it is not convenient to take a taxi at the door. Taxi in Hohhot is basically grabbed, and no tickets are given.Gate children can hardly call a car (I didn’t see the doorong).In addition, the towels are a bit hard, much worse than the Hyde towel in Baotou.However, it is the best in the center of Hohhot, and it is recommended to check in."
1,总体感觉不错。房间略小，已经够用了。性价比很高。位置略偏。附近有公园，超市，KFC。,"Overall feels good.The room is slightly smaller, and it is enough.The cost performance is very high.The position is slightly biased.There are parks, supermarkets, KFC."
1,整体上比较干净，很喜欢！床单、被褥干净，灯光很好！豪华单人间感觉特别好，389比较值得！这个店感觉好，可能住的比较多的缘故，民生路店就没什么感觉。,"It's clean overall, I like it very much!The sheets and bedding are clean and the lights are very good!Luxury single room feels particularly good, 389 is worth it!This shop feels good, and it may not be felt at Minsheng Road Store."
1,住好几个沈阳的酒店了，网络都不好，这个也一样，尤其是晚上11：30以后，好像就断了，再也连不上。郁闷死！酒店比较安静，但是大床是两张单人床拼的，不太爽。酒店周围吃饭的地方不多，也不太好！,"I have lived in a few Shenyang hotels, and the Internet is not good. This is the same, especially after 11:30 pm, it seems to be broken, and it will never be connected.Depressed!The hotel is relatively quiet, but the big bed is fighting in two single beds, which is not very cool.There are not many places to eat around the hotel, and it is not very good!"
1,6/7日入住酒店，接待小姐很热情，快速入住和快速退房很满意，唯一不足之处就是洗手间过分狭小，非常不便。,"Checking into the hotel on 6/7, the reception lady is very enthusiastic, and she is very satisfied with fast -checking and quick -checking. The only thing that is not enough is that the toilet is too narrow and very inconvenient."
1,房间设施还是很先进的，自动化程度相当高。但是我最喜欢的还是演艺馆的演出。竟然看了6场。水平真得不错，号称那些歌舞演员也是太子的正式员工，也要打卡上班的呢。杂技就更加精彩了，还有几个得过世界大奖的节目。建议去东莞出差的朋友一定不要放过这个机会，演艺馆才是最具特色的。对了，别忘了提前预订座位，中间的，前排的，最低消费也不高，每人才60多块钱，从晚上9点15看到12点，很值~~,"The room facilities are still very advanced, and the degree of automation is quite high.But my favorite is the performance of the entertainment hall.I even watched 6 games.The level is really good. It is also known as the official employees of the prince and dancers.Acrobatic is even more exciting, and there are several programs that have won the World Awards.It is recommended that friends who go to Dongguan on a business trip must not let go of this opportunity. The entertainment hall is the most distinctive.By the way, don't forget to book seats in advance, in the middle, front row, minimum consumption is not high, more than 60 yuan per person, see 12:15 in the evening, it is worth it ~~"
1,这酒店真的不错，入住那里很值得，不过唯一不足的是周边环境还不完善，离市区远点，不过有车就无所谓了，现在这房价能住这酒店我觉得打5分完全够格。,"This hotel is really good. It is worth it, but the only disadvantage is that the surrounding environment is not complete, and it is far from the city, but it doesn't matter if there is a car. Now this house price can live in this hotel."
1,升级之后的商务单人间A房间很不错，超大的床，睡起来很舒服。是从火车站对面的时代广场换过来的，所以相比而言，这里的环境也要好很多。在那边一路上都有人问我：“住宿不，小伙？”（小弟看起来好像年纪很小啊#_#）也要提一个不爽的事，尽管后来解决了，但还是得为后来的各位提个醒。预定的时候，携程上面的资料写着“商务单人间内配有电脑”，然后预定列表里有商务单人间A和商务单人间B两种。我就想当然地认为便宜的那种B型房也有电脑。（经过这次向携程咨询，携程上面的信息已经更正过来。）入住首先发现B型房没有。这是小事，除了这点，也推荐各位不要选择B型房。房间很小，基本相当于没有窗户，有一扇不透光的窗户，但是你基本不能打开。打开之后，首先眼前看到的是六楼的楼顶，然后楼顶上是几个卫星电视的大锅，一个哄哄响的中央空调。把窗户关紧，中央空调的声音也很清楚，估计半夜的时候会影响睡觉。这个房型是在七层，不知道是不是违规建的，很多东西都不正常，电梯只通到六层，要走一层楼梯才能上去，这一层好像也很少有人住。当然，后来携程和酒店的解决还是满意的：给升级到A型房。服务没太多接触。但是有一个比较好玩的，因为酒店二层是一家叫大连渔港的海鲜饭店，所以每到吃饭的时候，一层电梯口都站一排MM，看见有人来就热情地问你到几楼，并作势帮你按电梯，如果说到二层，则会一路陪伴你上去用餐；如果说其他客房楼层，就对你没啥兴趣了，伸出来按电梯的手也缩回去了。,"After the upgrade, Room A in the business single room is very good. The large bed is very comfortable to sleep.It is replaced from the Times Square opposite the train station, so in comparison, the environment here is much better.Someone asked me along the way: ""Can't accommodation, guy?"" (The younger brother seems to be very young#_#) I also have to mention a unhappy thing. Although it was resolved later, it still had to be the later everyone.Awakening.At the time of booking, the information above Ctrip reads ""Commercial Singles with Computers"", and then there are two types of business singles A and business single B.I want to take it for granted that the cheap type B room also has a computer.(After consulting with Ctrip, the information above Ctrip has been correct.) First, I found out that there was no type B room.This is a trivial matter. In addition to this, I also recommend that you do not choose the B room B.The room is small, which is basically equivalent to no windows, and there is an opaque window, but you basically cannot open it.After opening, first of all, the top of the building on the sixth floor was seen, and then there were several satellite TVs on the top of the building, a coaxed central air conditioner.Tight the window, the sound of the central air conditioner is also very clear. It is estimated that it will affect sleep in the middle of the night.This room type is on the seventh floor. I do n’t know if it is illegal. Many things are not normal. The elevator only goes to the sixth floor. It is necessary to take a staircase to go up. This layer seems to rarely live.Of course, the resolution of Ctrip and Hotel was still satisfied: it was upgraded to the A -type room.The service didn't have much contact.But one is more fun, because the second floor of the hotel is a seafood hotel called Dalian fishing port, so every time you eat, there is a row of MMs on a floor of the elevator.Press the elevator for you. If you talk about the second floor, you will accompany you all the way to dine. If you say that other rooms, you will have no interest in you."
1,"总体来说房间非常干净,卫浴设施也相当不错,交通也比较便利,唯一的不足之处就是早餐每天的内容都是一样的.实在让人无法忍受","In general, the room is very clean, the bathroom facilities are also quite good, and the transportation is relatively convenient. The only disadvantage is that the content of breakfast every day is the same."
0,前台服务员着装不整洁，有穿工作服的，有穿便装的；使用信用卡，本以为是刷预售权，谁知道刷完才说不能刷预售，只能刷消费，也不提前通知，而且态度恶劣，恶狠狠的说：“住一天！刷600！”，搞的好像我欠他们钱一样。房价与当地的一些单位的协议价格还是有差距。,"The front desk waiter is unclean, some wearing work clothes, and wearing stool; using a credit card, I thought it was a pre -sale right. Who knew that I could not brush the pre -sale.He said fiercely: ""Live for a day! Swipe 600!"", It seems like I owe them money.There is still a gap between the price of house prices and some local units."
1,近日在该酒店住宿了二晚，总体感觉不错，值得推荐。我们是2个人，订的是二室一厅的房间，价格实惠、相互之间没有干扰，房间内也很整洁，24楼的餐厅供应的简餐也很好，港式风味、经济可口。下次去北京还会在那里住。,"I stayed at the hotel for two nights recently. The overall feels good and worthy of recommendation.We are two people, and we have a room in the second room and one living room. The price is affordable, there is no interference with each other, and the room is also clean. The restaurant on the 24th floor is also very good. Hong Kong -style flavors and economical are delicious.I will live there next time I go to Beijing."
1,"前台客房服务态度好！早餐也很丰富，房价够干净。再接再厉！中国人的酒店就是无烟房间少，或者把烟灰缸放进抽屉就是无烟处理。我们这类75%不吸烟者需要再忍受25%烟鬼吗？希望中国办的宾馆向外企学习。请多设无烟楼层。谢谢。我原先定的房价没有无烟层楼了，我就得加付20%提升高级点的无烟层房间。Wearethe75%non-smokers,itisabouttimethattheHotelrespectustohavethefreedomoffreshair,BANtheSmokersintheCheck-inorCheck-outcounterplease.Thankyou.有或者很少房!梯不吸,是有一些吸者仍然有服!我是不抽的人,成二手的受害者!(中13人口中,民只有3.2.不到1/4!!!)看到的民,自好?.","The front desk room service attitude is good!Breakfast is also rich, and house prices are clean enough.make persistent efforts!The Chinese hotel is that there are fewer smoke rooms, or the ashtray is placed in a drawer is smokeless treatment.Do we need to endure 25%of the smokers?I hope that the hotels run by China will learn from foreign companies.Please set more smoke floors.Thanks.I had no smoke -free floor at my original house price, so I had to pay 20%to increase the high -level smoke -free room.Among the 13 people, the people are only 3.2. less than 1/4 !!!)"
1,如家，一贯的风格，房间也是这样，怎么说，如家的价格还是比较实在，在上海住店，能干净、价格优惠就行了。。。,"Such as home, consistent style, and rooms are the same. How to say, the price of the home is still relatively solid. It can be cleaned and priced in Shanghai in Shanghai.EssenceEssence"

I really have a very exciting thing. One of everyone in everyone: The room I live in is six houses.Not much water.Since I am doing a hotel, I have to check the grass once myself at the time of check -out.I have to be very clear: I use a small square scarf on the outside, and I put it in the Tomo, and I have other toiletries; there are small square towels in the bathroom (one in the bedside cabinet, as soon as you put your hands on the marble face of the washing hands.In), when I got a scarf in Checkout's waiting room, I and I had a shop in front. Either you searched my bag or me, or you can't add the charges of Mo to me!I do n’t care to retreat, and some deputy managers of the lobby have come to face.

1,携程定的不带早饭，所以不能评价吃的。总体来说装修不错，没有什么特别大的毛病。停车先收20快一天，最后到前台报销。空调非常足，都有点过热了。这个价位住到这样子的酒店，非常好了。感觉比较适合家庭出游。上网贵的就是不要上网了，比较黑。,"Ctrip has no breakfast, so it cannot be evaluated.Overall the decoration is good, there is nothing particularly big.Get the parking for 20 days, and finally reimburse in the front desk.The air conditioner is very sufficient and it is a bit overheated.It is very good to stay at this hotel at this price.It feels more suitable for family travel.It is not necessary to surf the Internet. It is darker."

0,服务态度似乎还可以接受，但可惜的是：我同事房间没有网线口(10层)，咖啡厅很早就关门了，早餐说是到10点半，实际上到9点就没有了，也不加了。送餐服务到晚上八点就停止了。该饭店周围环境很差，被垃圾包围。玻璃是不隔音的，所以，尽管我住在10层，依旧每天早晨不用脑中就被窗外的汽笛声叫起。,"The service attitude seems to be acceptable, but unfortunately: My colleague's room has no network cable port (10th floor), the cafe was closed very early. The breakfast said that it was 10:30.add.The food delivery service stopped at eight in the evening.The surrounding environment of the restaurant is very poor and is surrounded by garbage.The glass is not soundproof, so although I live on the 10th floor, I still be screamed by the whistle outside the window every morning without the need for my head."
0,"要不是飞机到达时间22点才不会选择此酒店,外面飞机的声音很大,隔音效果很差,房间也一般.晚上有骚扰电话,下次不会选择.","If it wasn't for the aircraft to reach 22 o'clock, I would not choose this hotel. The sound of the plane outside was very loud, the sound insulation effect was very poor, and the room was average. There was a harassment phone at night, and I would not choose next time."
1,我感觉还可以啊。有些小细节比较体贴：桌子上放着文具筒；到二楼早餐，路比较绕，但是有个服务员会不厌其烦的带你到楼梯口。大堂服务不好，尤其是有个男前台，没次说话都跟家里失火似的急。晚上一定要记得拔电话线，骚扰电话很多，男人都容易冲动，冲动后就会很后悔了。,"I feel okay.Some small details are more considerate: there are stationery tubs on the table; breakfast on the second floor, the road is more around, but a waiter will take you to the stairs entrance.The lobby service is not good, especially there is a male front desk, and no time to speak is like a fire at home.In the evening, you must remember to draw a telephone line. There are many harassment calls. Men are prone to impulse, and they will regret it after impulse."
0,"此酒店环境太差,服务一般,卫生间洗澡起来像涨水灾一样,酒店也未评星级,更可气的是一楼的歌厅,晚上吵得简直没法睡,大家要知道在高原地区没睡好觉是多么难受的,而且通过携程所订的房间酒店会安排最差的房间给您.我希望携程以后对会员酒店应该更严格审查.","This hotel's environment is too poor, the service is average, the bathroom is like a flood, and the hotel has not rated the stars. What's more annoying is that the first floor of the singing hall is so noisy that you can't sleep at night.How uncomfortable it is, and it will arrange the worst rooms through the room hotel ordered by Ctrip. I hope that Ctrip should be more stringent review of member hotels in the future."
1,位置太不方便了，门口单行线，出去近，回来远了一倍,"The location is too inconvenient, one line at the door, go out near, double the back"
1,"本人入住的是会所房,适逢一个会议但酒店丝毫没有忙乱的情况,接待能力绝对过硬,是一间真正的度假酒店,印象极好,肯定会多次前往.由于本人一直在石梅湾潜水,以后基本不会考虑三亚了.","I stayed in the clubhouse, coincided with a meeting but the hotel was not busy at all. The reception ability was absolutely excellent. It was a real resort hotel., I will basically not consider Sanya in the future."
1,"帮日本客人订的酒店,五星级这个价位算很便宜.至于环境和服务设施等应该很不错吧.","The price of a five -star price for helping Japanese guests is very cheap. As for environmental and service facilities, it should be very good."
0,说老实话，我还没有见过这么差的酒店呢！前台服务人员素质极低，还给我信用卡用扔的方式，打电话给前台直接挂我的电话。我不知道是不是价格低一点，就有了别人非住不可的自信。总之，非常差，希望以后取得朋友们注意了。尽量不要选择这个酒店，除了生气，不被尊重，可别指望能够享受到什么服务。,"To be honest, I haven't seen such a bad hotel yet!The quality of the front desk service personnel is extremely low. I also gave me a credit card and called the front desk to directly hang my phone.I don't know if the price is lower, so I have the confidence of others.In short, very bad, I hope to get friends in the future.Try not to choose this hotel. Except for being angry and not respected, don't expect any services to enjoy."
1,这次是元旦期间入住的，酒店装修不是很新，但是比较干净。房间比想象当中的大，正好面对门口的河，风景还算不错。房间不能开窗，感觉空调不是太好。入住和退房比较快。离地铁有点远，但是门口有公交或者可以打的（起步价即可）到沙田火车站转轨道交通。酒店的早餐很难吃，但是酒店附近有很多餐馆，蛮实惠的。附近还有屈臣氏和711便利店，买点日用品或者零食饮料也很方便。考虑到性价比，今后仍有可能还住这里。,"This time I stayed in the New Year's Day. The hotel decoration was not very new, but it was relatively clean.The room is larger than the imagination. It just faces the river at the door, and the scenery is pretty good.The room cannot be opened, and the air conditioner is not very good.Check and check out faster.It is a bit far from the subway, but there is a bus at the door or can be hit (the starting price can be available) to the Shatian Railway Station to transfer to the rail transit.The hotel's breakfast is difficult to eat, but there are many restaurants near the hotel, which is quite affordable.There are also Watsons and 711 convenience stores nearby. It is also convenient to buy daily necessities or snacks.Considering cost -effectiveness, it is still possible to live here in the future."
0,空气好是没有话说的。鱼疗减少了很多的死皮。温泉的确是室外的好（虽然不是很深，人是不能站起来的），但是服务上要加强的地方太多了。第一，早餐9：30要结束，我大约9：25左右到餐厅，餐厅的迎宾没有事先告知，进去后，早餐已经收得差不多了，从服务员手里抢了一大盘米粉，基本没有吃到什么。第二，2楼的房间都没有保险箱，就差这一个楼层么？第三，中餐厅的服务员没有事的时候就聚在巴台聊天，服务基本靠自助。第四，温泉的服务也不是很好，我们一起去了三个人，要做足疗，我们在等服务员的时候，一起来的一个人跑开了，因为他不清楚另外一个人请他做足疗，服务员来了后，出去找他，他没有弄清就说自己不做，服务员就跑了，等他再进来弄清楚后，再请服务员，怎么都请不来，这两个帮我们做好了之后，也都逃一样的走了。再也叫不到人了。第四，温泉的毛巾一定要看好，很多不自觉的游客，自己的扔在地上或者弄湿了，就随手拿别人放好的。温泉的毛巾管理方面存在很大的问题。我们本来定了两个房间，我的房间因为临时有事情，跟携程说过改动了，朋友因为受到以上的待遇，也只好提前结束了行程。好像边上还有一家叫“南苑”的，但是好像没有在携程上找到，不知道那家会怎么样？,"There is nothing to say if the air is good.Fish therapy reduces a lot of dead skin.The hot spring is indeed outdoors (although not very deep, people cannot stand up), but there are too many places to strengthen the service.First, the breakfast is ended at 9:30. I arrived at the restaurant about 9:25. The welcome guest of the restaurant did not inform in advance. After entering, the breakfast was almost collected. I grabbed a large plate of rice noodles from the waiter.What to do.Second, there is no safe on the second floor. Is this floor worse?Third, when the waiters of the Chinese restaurant have nothing to do, they gathered in Batai to chat, and the service is basically self -service.Fourth, the service of the hot spring is not very good. We went to three people together to do sufficient therapy. When we were waiting for the waiter, one person came together because he did not know that another person asked him to do sufficient treatment.After the waiter came, he went out to find him. He said that he would not do it without knowing it, and the waiter ran away. After he came in to figure it out, please invite the waiter, how can you do it?After that, they all ran away.I can never call people anymore.Fourth, the towels of hot springs must be optimistic. Many unconscious tourists, throwing themselves on the ground or wetting, just put others and put them.There are big problems in the management of hot springs.We originally set up two rooms. Because of my temporary things in my room, I told Ctrip that I have changed. Friends have to end the trip early because of the above treatment.It seems that there is a ""Nanyuan"" on the side, but it seems that I didn't find it on Ctrip. I don't know what would happen?"
1,"经常去海口出差,但从没住过该酒店.看外表感觉一般吧其实酒店里面还真不错,房间是新装修的(我住的是20楼商务楼层),很干净,隔音也很好,基本上没听到马路的声音.空调的声音有一点点大,呵呵但是上网的电源比较麻烦,找不到插座,要把电视的拔掉再充电.还要钻到书抬下面去弄,不爽!!洗澡水的据说是温泉水,呵呵,不是很习惯,感觉老是滑滑的,像没洗干净一样:)补充点评2008年4月9日：还有,今天本来还想订该酒店的,居然没看到有商务大床房了~~郁闷~","I often go to Haikou to travel on a business trip, but I have never lived in the hotel. It feels like the appearance is actually good. In fact, the hotel is really good. The room is newly renovated (I live in the business floor of the 20th floor). It is very clean and the sound insulation is also very good.I did n’t hear the sound of the road. The sound of the air conditioner was a little bit loud, haha, but the power on the Internet was more troublesome. If you ca n’t find the socket, you need to unplug the TV and charge it. You have to get rid of the book and lift it. Unhappy!! The bath water is said to be hot spring water, haha, not very used to it, it feels always slippery, just like it is not cleaned :) Supplement of Comment on April 9, 2008: Also, I still want to book the hotel today,I didn't see a big business bed room ~~ Depressed ~"
1,环境比较静，但比较偏一点。床太小，选的大床的单人间，318/间，竟比298的标间空间还小，不知道288的大床单人间会不会更小。优点是靠近九江长江大桥，开车经高速路过此地时，比较方便，将近一宿。,"The environment is relatively quiet, but it is a little bit.The bed is too small, the single -person room for the large bed, 318/room, is even smaller than the 298 standard room. I don't know if the 288 large sheets will be smaller.The advantage is that it is close to the Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge. When driving through the highway passing by here, it is more convenient and nearly one."
1,听朋友的介绍去了开元渡假村，感觉真的很不错，酒店很干净，服务也很好！如果下次还去的话，会多住上几天。意外的小插曲是，晚上在阳台上打牌开着门，结果晚上睡觉后被不知名的小虫子和蚊子围攻。。。那叫一个牺牲啊！！！早上醒来才发现酒店其实有小告示牌说让晚上不要开门来着。。。不过，我想是因为周围绿化太好了的缘故吧！,"I heard a friend's introduction to Kaiyuan Resort. It feels really good. The hotel is clean and the service is good!If you go to the next time, live a few more days.The unexpected episodes were to open the door on the balcony at night. As a result, I was besieged by an unknown little bug and mosquito after going to bed at night.EssenceEssenceThat's a sacrifice!IntersectionIntersectionI woke up in the morning and found that the hotel actually had a small sign saying that it would not open the door at night.EssenceEssenceHowever, I think it is because the surrounding greening is so good!"
1,每次来福州都住这里，比刚开始贵了不少。不过就是喜欢他们家的羽绒被，比我自己买的舒服。不知道酒店考不考虑将被子出售，如果是新的的话。早餐也还不错。,"Every time I come to Fuzhou, I live here, which is much more expensive than the beginning.But just like the down quilt of their family than I bought.I don't know if the hotel test does not consider selling the quilt, if it is new.Breakfast is not bad."
1,这是时隔两年第二次入住这个宾馆了。环境依旧很好，第一次和朋友入住时一致认为很灵，第二次陪老妈，老妈也认为很灵。早餐比两年前有进步，但就四星来说仍有不足。相信会再次拜访这里，因为优美的环境。,"This is the second time to stay in this hotel after two years.The environment is still very good. When I stayed with my friends for the first time, I agreed with my friends. The second time with my mother, my mother thought it was very spiritual.Breakfast has improved compared to two years ago, but four stars are still inadequate.I believe it will visit here again because of the beautiful environment."
0,"餐厅的服务员态度不友好,免费提供的早餐有的在早上八点就没有供应了(蒸鸡蛋和炒米粉),小妹与服务员交涉两次未果,早餐供应时间是到上午九点结束的.希望该酒店应对早餐供应有所改善.对客房服务员要进行培训,当客人房门门锁上挂了""请勿打扰""的字样,希望不要再擅自进入客房,这是对客人的尊重.","The restaurant's waiter is not friendly, and the free breakfast provided for free will not be supplied at eight in the morning (steamed eggs and fried rice noodles).The hotel has improved breakfast supply.

1,"酒店的大堂很漂亮,房间不算小,设施还可以也很干净,离码头很近,而且又有车接送,很方便.晚上22:45肚子饿了,叫了一碗XO酱海鲜炒饭和一杯蜜瓜汁,味道真不错.","The lobby of the hotel is very beautiful, the room is not small, the facilities can also be very clean, it is close to the pier, and there is a car pick -up, which is very convenient. The stomach is hungry at 22:45 in the evening.Honey melon juice, the taste is really good."
1,地理位置很方便，就在中山广场边上，去景区均有公交，打车去也就十多元钱，我们在11楼，窗户边能看到中山广场美丽夜景。只是房内设施较旧，不能上网,"The geographical location is very convenient. On the side of Zhongshan Square, there are buses to the scenic area, and it is more than ten yuan to take a taxi. On the 11th floor, we can see the beautiful night view of Zhongshan Square by the window.It's just that the facilities in the room are old and cannot access the Internet"
1,下午2点半到了，入住手续很快办好，湖景房，房间不大，可以看到湖景和院子，大堂在山上，室外游泳池不错，外面就是湖了。晚上在酒店中餐厅吃饭，点了著名的千岛湖鱼头汤。以五星级宾馆而言不贵，洗澡水不大，早餐也是五星里一般化。不过酒店的标准按国际话来说还是要努力的，主要是细节不够，如此等等，象会务都是国内的烟草呀，国有银行呀，房地产呀，乱哄哄的。层次不高，当然如果是国际著名酒店来管理就不是这个价位了。当然还是千岛湖目前最好的酒店吧。,"At 2:30 in the afternoon, the procedures for check -in are quickly completed. The lake view room and the room are not large. You can see the lake view and the courtyard. The lobby is on the mountain. The outdoor swimming pool is good. The outside is the lake.I ate at the hotel in the hotel in the evening and ordered the famous Qiandao Lake fish head soup.In terms of five -star hotels, it is not expensive, bathing water is not large, and breakfast is also generally in five -star.However, the hotel's standards still have to work hard according to international words, mainly because the details are not enough, so, etc., such as the conference affairs are domestic tobacco, state -owned banks, real estate, and chaotic.The level is not high. Of course, if it is a famous international hotel, it is not the price.Of course, it is the best hotel in Qiandao Lake."
1,房间整洁规范，看得出在管理上下了一番功夫。自助餐不错，喜欢吃里面烫熟的青菜，很嫩。不过价格也是五星级的价格。,"The room is neat and standardized.The buffet is good. I like to eat hot vegetables inside, very tender.But the price is also a five -star price."
0,"大堂经理服务意识不足,房务员把我的隐形眼镜盒子丢了,大堂经理查了竟说没这事","The lobby manager's service consciousness was insufficient, and the house clerk lost my contact lens box."
1,"感觉挺好的,是家不错的酒店,下个月去办事打算还住那儿.","It feels good, it is a good hotel. I plan to live there next month."
1,酒店环境还不错，比旁边的建工锦江好一些，不过价格也高了不少，如果有公司协议价格入住就比较划算了。交通还算方便，去机场的班车过了马路就是，地铁站也就走10分钟左右，不过上下班时打车有点不方便，建议坐公交或地铁。,"The hotel environment is not bad. It is better than the construction worker next to the construction worker, but the price is much higher.The transportation is quite convenient. After the bus to the airport, the road station is about 10 minutes. However, it is a bit inconvenient to take a taxi at get off work. It is recommended to take a bus or subway."
0,这酒店很臭，我订的经济单间，房间小的可怜。房间除了床就没有其它空间了，挂衣柜占据了大部分的空间（我认为没有必要做那么柜子）。在那么个破地方，价钱就像是宰人,"The hotel is stinky, the economy I booked is small, the room is small.There is no other space except the bed. Hanging the wardrobe occupies most of the space (I don't think it is necessary to make such a cabinet).In such a broken place, the price is like slaughtering people"
1,房间空间小显得压抑，设施简单没有起码的消费品种，装修年份较久卫生条件一般。,"The room space is small, and the facilities are simple and there are no minimum consumer varieties. The year of decoration is relatively long."
1,位置优越、房间大气、设施齐全、网络快速、服务不错。建议：check-out的时候能快一些。希望下次来乌鲁木齐还入住！,"Excellent location, full room atmosphere, complete facilities, fast network, and good service.Suggestion: Check-out can be faster.I hope I will stay in Urumqi next time!"

1,酒店在开发区口上，正好是出差在开发区办事。所以感觉很方便。房间的暖气开的很足，所以-15度的气温也不感觉冷。房间质量还可以，开发区有这样的酒店很满足了。就是早餐质量有待改善，便宜是便宜，但是实在是没什么可以吃的。,"The hotel is on the development zone exit, which is just a business trip in the development zone.So it feels convenient.The heating of the room is enough, so the temperature of -15 degrees does not feel cold.The quality of the room is okay, and the development area is very satisfied.The quality of breakfast needs to be improved, cheap is cheap, but there is nothing to eat."
1,"很安静,隔音设施不错.服务员态度很好,下次还会选这里","Very quiet, the sound insulation facilities are good. The waiter attitude is very good. I will choose here next time"
0,周边环境还是不错的，但是酒店的服务人员态度奇差，房间比较小，是我住过酒店中间服务最差的一个。,"The surrounding environment is still good, but the service staff of the hotel is strange and the room is relatively small. It is the worst service in the hotel in the hotel."
1,挂牌四星级，但实际感觉不够标准，不过房间还算比较干净。马桶居然是TOTO的，其他洁具也都是名牌，比较好用，衣柜中有感应灯还有一个小保险柜，柜子中还有一个小冰箱，阳台上可以晒衣服，唯一不足的是楼下在施工，有点吵，过道有股潮味。酒店位置还可以，楼下过马路就是椰海长廊,"Listed four -star level, but the actual feel is not standard enough, but the room is relatively clean.The toilet is actually TOTO. Other sanitary ware is also a famous brand. It is better to use. There are induction lights in the wardrobe and a small safe. There is a small refrigerator in the cabinet. You can dry clothes on the balcony.Construction is a bit noisy, and the aisle has a trend.The hotel location is okay, the road downstairs is the coconut sea corridor"
1,酒店的环境还是不错的，服务员也热情，去的当天，酒店在大堂组织了全体员工为汶川灾区捐款，感动之余我和另几位旅友也捐了些小钱。,"The environment of the hotel is still good, and the waiter is also enthusiastic. On the day of the go, the hotel organized all employees to donate to the Wenchuan disaster area in the lobby. After being moved, I donated some money with other travelers."
1,"环境不错，比较安静，停车管理也很好，离开花港观鱼步行15分钟足够。豪华大床间的床不够大，三口之家如果孩子大一点是有点拥挤的。不过整个酒店还算比较中规中矩。客房也干净，服务员也很客气。餐厅不满意，晚餐懒的出去吃就去餐厅，首先是菜单很普通，象小菜馆的菜单，装盆都是大盆，三口之家很浪费，可能是因为酒店为省总工会的工人疗养院兼体检中心，所以菜非常的淡，好像忘记放盐了一样。不建议餐厅用餐。早餐的品种不丰富，早餐很一般。我个人认为住宿是个不错的地方，对于自己开车去，还是不错的选择。吃饭还是走15分钟到花港观鱼门口的“味庄”吧。补充点评2008年2月15日：楼下说的不错,那个副理确实很能承受。那个顾客确实很不象话，一个说话很恶毒的顾客。","The environment is good, relatively quiet, and the parking management is also very good.

1,设施很不错；周边环境不错，紧邻金沙滩；推荐海景房不足：比较偏；吃饭不放便；酒店自带的餐厅性价比太差。价格太贵，口味不好；,"The facilities are very good; the surrounding environment is good, close to the Golden Beach; it is recommended that the sea view room is not enough: it is relatively biased; it is not convenient to eat; the restaurant comes with the hotel is too cost -effective.The price is too expensive, the taste is not good;"

1,"总体来说,对于这次入住还是比较满意的.房间设施和看到的图片基本一致,卫生间不错;客栈院子给人家的感觉,非常的不错.不过,客栈的服务方面,个人认为应该加以改进,尤其是在房间清扫这方面.","Overall, it is relatively satisfactory for this check -in.

1,11月份住了一次。1.服务方面还不错，门童挺积极。2.感觉房间略有陈旧。3.早餐品种还算丰富。4.总的来说，作为4星酒店还略有不足，不过价格还是挺实惠的。,"I lived once in November.1. The service is not bad, and the door children are very positive.2.

1,酒店条件一般，不过地理位置很好.出门就是超市和水果摊，买东西很方便。超市关门时间比较早，不过水果摊倒是到很晚还有的。出酒店走5分钟就是万胜街，有很多小饭店和当地的快餐。总的来说还是比较适合旅游居住的。,"The hotel conditions are average, but the geographical location is very good. Going out is supermarkets and fruit stalls. It is convenient to buy things.The supermarket has been closed early, but the fruits are still late.Out of the hotel for 5 minutes is Wansheng Street, there are many small restaurants and local fast food.In general, it is more suitable for traveling."

1,花园式酒店，很安静，里面都是一幢幢矮楼，没有电梯。订了经济标准间，免费升级到了行政间，房间设施很一般，不过还算挺干净的。房间送水果和报纸，服务非常好，无论是门童和前台服务都很好。,"Garden -style hotels are very quiet. There are short buildings inside, without elevators.After booking the economic standard room, it is upgraded to the administrative room for free. The room facilities are very average, but it is quite clean.The room is delivered with fruits and newspapers. The service is very good, both door children and front desk services are very good."
1,酒店地点确实比较偏，但是的士司机都还好找到，酒店门脸太小气，确实不太适合见客户；房间比我想象的要大很多，大概10多个平方吧，浴室、洗手间很干净，配套设施也比较好，而且有免费宽带上网，速度不错，方便商务人士办公。我定的大床房，特价159/天，睡起来也宽敞，但是房间灯光感觉不够明亮，电视节目也比较少，房间隔音是个问题，晚上还好点，早上服务员送早餐和收拾房间的时候，就象火车开过一样，扰人清梦呀！整体来说，考虑到这个价格，还算比较可以的。,"The hotel location is indeed relatively biased, but the taxi drivers are well found. The hotel's door is too stingy, and it is really not suitable for customers. The room is much larger than I think.The facilities are also better, and there are free broadband access to the Internet.

1,房间状况相当不错，和我在南京入住的5星酒店基本一致，服务态度和酒店环境都比较令人满意，唯一的问题就是退房时检查房间用了近40分钟，不知道他们查些什么花了那么久,The situation in the room is quite good. It is basically the same as the 5 -star hotel I stayed in Nanjing. The service attitude and the hotel environment are relatively satisfactory. The only problem is that it took nearly 40 minutes to check the room when checking out.

1,房间不错，带阳台的房间可以看到大大的草坪和远处的大海。房间里面还有功夫茶具，非常温馨。早餐品种不错，还有闽南特色小吃。在厦门住过的最好的酒店了。,"The room is good, and the room with a balcony can be seen in large lawns and the sea in the distance.There is also Kung Fu tea set in the room, which is very warm.Breakfast varieties are good, and southern Fujian snacks.The best hotel I have lived in Xiamen."
0,环境吵，服务不好，入房时还给错房卡，进房时吓一跳，有人住，赶紧下楼问柜台说给错了。进房间烟位非常浓，说要来做无菸处理，来了竟然说无菸处理就是将菸灰缸拿掉就好，烟味几天就会散掉，真是气死了，跟他理论后他才说要拿清净剂来喷，喷了后烟味还是很重，实在不能接受。前面在修马路路上泥巴很多。早餐是送到房里，不好吃。服务态度不怎样。房里的洗衣机不见了，怎洗衣服呢。,"The environment is noisy, the service is not good, and when you enter the room, you will also give the wrong house card. When you enter the house, you will be frightened. Someone lives.The smoke in the room is very strong.

1,交通方便，服务也满意，周围环境也不错,"Convenient transportation, satisfactory service, and the surrounding environment is also good"
1,所在地应该是徐汇比较好的地段，很幽静，旁边就是爱菊小学，出门往右走到路口有超市和水果店，好像还有家西餐厅或是酒吧，但是其他吃饭的地方就不大好找了。酒店出门往左应该可以走到地铁衡山路站，哪个出口就不晓得了。酒店的环境很好，音乐喷泉，青翠草坪，感觉很不错。。。就是房间太小，甚至比香港的酒店还小，另外送餐的种类太少，早餐一般，没体现出上海的特色。。服务还是不错的，但是某些服务员较冷淡，算啦，反正你们的脸色也不是电视机屏幕，不用一直看的,"The location should be a better location for Xuhui.

1,这个酒店地理位置不错，在无锡比较市中心区~出行方便,"This hotel has a good geographical location, and it is convenient to travel in the center of the city in Wuxi ~"
1,原先定的并洲饭店，但离办事的地方较远，所以很犹豫地定了一个晚上，没想到入住以后发现很干净，一点都不比湖滨饭店之类的所谓星级酒店差，于是马上联系携程，在太原的三天全都改定漳电。头一天晚上旁边住的几个人打了一宿的牌，吵得很，一晚上没睡好，早上告诉前台，服务很好，态度也不错，马上通知服务员去了解，第二天晚上安安静静的，让我睡个好觉，下次一定还选这！,"Originally, the Zhouzhou Hotel, but far from the place of work, so he was hesitant for a night. I did not expect to find that it was clean after staying.In the three days of Taiyuan, Zhang Dian was changed.A few people living next night they played a card and made a lot of noise. I didn't sleep well all night. I told the front desk in the morning that the service was good and the attitude was good. I immediately notified the waiter to understand. The next night, quiet and quiet the next night.Yes, let me sleep well, I will choose this next time!"
0,我想在此提供本人的入住经历给大家，仅供参考1.提前预订酒店时就曾打电话申明过需要接机，结果当日下机后和老公托着行李前前后后找了一圈也没找到来接我们的师傅。无奈之下只得自己叫上出租车前往，好在距离不算太远，旅游公司的车只花了二十元2.从进饭店的那一刻起我就开始后悔，这个酒店是有些年头了，外表和内在的设施都已陈旧，进酒店之后也没有服务生过来帮忙提行李，从旁边经过却熟视无睹。3.房间太小，比想像中还要让人失望，所谓的高级客房充其只能算个普通单间。4.送的水果是两个小苹果，一根小香蕉。鲜花我也没见到过，也许就是因为免费赠送的原因吧。不能太过计较，怎么说也算是送了。5.早餐，也许是因为太早要赶去丽江的原因，所以服务生打包送到房间里来了，馒头之类的东东，单调的只能是充饥而已。虽说酒店离机场比较近，但是昆明的交通啊，和咱们武汉一样的，不敢恭维！昆明机场也是，一大清早让人感觉是春运的火车站，所以提醒朋友们，一定要早到以免误机！以上便是入住此饭店的个人感受，我只停留了近十个小时，性价比真的是很差，实在是有待加强！,"I want to provide my check -in experience here for everyone, for reference only 1. When booking the hotel in advance, I called and stated that it is necessary to pick up the plane.Find the master who picks up with us.In desperation, I had to call the taxi by myself. Fortunately, it was not too far away. The tour company's car spent only 20 yuan 2. From the moment I entered the hotel, I started to regret it. This hotel is for some years.The appearance and inner facilities are old. After entering the hotel, no waiters came to help lift their luggage, but they turned a blind eye to the side.3. The room is too small, and it is more disappointing than expected. The so -called advanced rooms can only be regarded as an ordinary single room.4. The fruit sent is two little apples and a small banana.I have never seen flowers, maybe because of free gifts.You can't count too much, how can you say it is given.5. Breakfast, maybe because it is too early to rush to Lijiang, the waiter packed it to the room. The stuff such as steamed buns can only be hungry.Although the hotel is closer to the airport, the transportation of Kunming is the same as us in Wuhan, dare not compliment!Kunming Airport is also. Early in the morning, people feel like the Spring Festival railway station, so remind friends that they must be so early to avoid misunderstanding!The above is the personal feelings of staying in this hotel. I only stayed for nearly ten hours. The cost -effectiveness is really poor. It is to be strengthened!"
0,"服务实在太差!7月9日入住的,晚上11店打1168总机拜托第二天早上645分叫醒服务,房号:2319(便于查询与确认)。竟然没有做到!!这是我这个长期出差者第一次碰到的事情,因为10日早上830分有会议才提前一天住酒店的,还好这个酒店的床板硬得不能好好入睡,才""救""了我。特此评价。","The service is too bad!

0,"由于五一当天决定出去玩,订晚了,只有三家酒店可选择,就选了这家.优点:酒店在青山湖边,房间要选临湖那面,感觉还算清静,酒店的绿化还算好.缺点:房间设施太过简陋,顶多是个普通的招待所的标准,卫生间太简陋,那个马桶简直脏的吓人,不是打扫的不干净,不知道是用了太多年还是质量太差,整个马桶都是乌其麻黑的.不要在酒店吃饭,太湖源,天目山景区里有农家乐,找停车多的那种,价格公道,材料新鲜,那个土鸡汤味道真实鲜得来...","Since I decided to go out on May 1st, I booked late.

0,经济型酒店虽然没有太高的要求但房间实在是太小了，很有种做牢的感觉，如果是无窗的房间那就更糟糕了，建议大伙不要住无窗房。,"Although there is no too high requirements for economical hotels, the room is too small, and it feels like it is done. If it is a windowless room, it is even worse. It is recommended that everyone do not live in no rooms."
1,酒店的环境住宿和温泉都很好，服务更没得说的，很体贴！自助餐品种很多，也很新鲜！我下次还是会去的！宾馆反馈2008年5月29日：谢谢您的惠顾，我们将会继续努力，提供更完善的服务！,"The hotel's environmental accommodation and hot springs are very good, and the service is not even more able to say, very considerate!There are many types of buffets and are very fresh!I will go next time!Hotel feedback on May 29, 2008: Thank you for your patronage, we will continue to work hard to provide more complete services!"

0,为什么我们每天订房间，就不送水果、咖啡！协程网上有果盘送的！简直不讲道理！,"Why do we book a room every day, we do n’t give fruit or coffee!There are fruit disks on the Internet!It doesn't make sense!"
1,2007年9月11日256元住普通标间，临街（其它房型已无）。我是喜欢开着窗睡觉的，总体感觉不太吵。因为下面的玉皇阁北街不算是银川的主要交通要道。早上有一些车流声。对面有个农贸市场，购买应季瓜果很方便。离鼓楼不远，可以品尝一下“老毛抓肉”。,"On September 11, 2007, 256 yuan lived in the ordinary standard room, and the street (no other room type was no longer).I like to sleep on the window, and I don't feel too noisy.Because the following Jade Emperor Pavilion North Street is not the main traffic road of Yinchuan.There are some traffic sounds in the morning.There is a farmer's market on the opposite side, and it is convenient to buy seasonal melon fruit.Not far from the Drum Tower, you can taste ""Lao Mao Grab Meat""."
0,房型：江景双人商务房/2006、2008（440元/天、间）客房服务：服务员态度很好，但很挑剔，我故意搞脏一点的小毛巾居然被他们发现了要我赔了5元（我到每处酒店都喜欢玩一玩），宽容度太低。建议非要入住的客人自备洗脸毛巾。前台服务：入住、退房、接待及时态度非常好！很有修养！客房：室内温度太高不能调节，整夜打开窗户还凑合，但下面锅炉房轰鸣声甚大。要外出的话穿衣动作一定要迅速，否则，会汗流浃背（室内外温差约50度）！地面看似干净，不小心很容易带上毛发上床（但被褥雪白雪白的，超干净！很细的毛发都能显示得清清楚楚）。窗外松花江太阳岛一览无遗，可看日落！早餐：超级不好，品种少的可怜（比三星差很多），比如牛奶只能说是有牛奶味的开水（很凉）。芹菜抄肉片的芹菜是黄黄的，肯定摆了不少天。餐厅服务员除了收早餐票的，都无精打采。,"Room type: Jiangjing dual business house/2006, 2008 (440 yuan/day, room) guest room service: The waiter attitude is very good, but very picky, I deliberately engaged in a little dirty towel actually discovered that I asked me to pay 5 yuan for 5 yuan(I like to play every hotel), the tolerance is too low.It is recommended that guests who have to stay with their face towels.Front desk service: check -in, check -out, and timely reception are very good!Very cultivated!Guest room: The indoor temperature is too high and cannot be adjusted. Opening the window all night is still together, but the roar of the boiler room below is very roar.The dressing movements to go out must be fast, otherwise, it will sweat back (the temperature difference between indoor and outdoor is about 50 degrees)!The ground seems to be clean, and it is easy to bring hair to bed (but the bedding is white, super clean! It can be displayed clearly with fine hair).At a glance, the Songhua River Sun Island outside the window is clear, you can see the sunset!Breakfast: Super bad, there are fewer varieties (much worse than Samsung). For example, milk can only be said to have milk -flavored boiling water (very cold).The celery of celery copied meat is yellow, and there must be a lot of heavens.The restaurant waiters are listless except for breakfast tickets."

1,酒店环境确实不错，离市中心也近。因航班改期，没有订到相同的房间，我们到时已是半夜，要求两天换到同样的行政楼层，前台小姐很热情的帮我们办理了，还主动帮我们回复了携程，很满意。房间还可以，只是卫生间的淋浴是头顶式莲蓬，相当不便，水流也小。不过在宜昌能有这样的酒店，应该算是不错了。,"The hotel environment is really good, and it is close to the city center.Due to the change of flights, we did not order the same room. We were already in the middle of the night and asked for two days to change to the same administrative floor. The lady at the front desk was very enthusiastic to handle it. I also took the initiative to help us reply to Ctrip. I was very satisfied.The room is okay, but the bathroom shower is a top lotus, which is quite inconvenient, and the water flows are small.However, there should be a good hotel in Yichang."
0,"房间还可以,可是竟然没有网络.上网要到大堂非常不方便.前台人员素质很差,要求换个房间给他们谈了两次,每次30分钟,最后领班来了才解决.","The room is okay, but there is no network. It is very inconvenient to go to the lobby on the Internet. The quality of the front desk is very poor. It is required to change the room to them twice, 30 minutes each time, and finally the foreman came to solve it."
1,酒店是很新的，环境也很好！交通不错，我想10月份去的话，还会选择住此酒店。再次声明2个小问题：1：宽带的收费很昂贵，40港币/小时或120港币/天2：大家住的时候可能因为电源插座的尺寸不对而影响到使用自带的电脑，手机等。不过，可以跟酒店前台索取。只有一个哦！嘿嘿这个位置很不错的，走路去海边看夜景只要20分钟不到。很感谢携程的预定。,"The hotel is very new and the environment is very good!The traffic is good. If I want to go in October, I will choose to stay in this hotel.Two small problems again: 1: Broadband charges are expensive, 40 Hong Kong dollars/h or 120 Hong Kong dollars/day 2: When you live, you may affect your own computer, mobile phone, etc. when the size of the power socket is incorrect.However, you can get it with the hotel's front desk.There is only one!Hey, this position is very good. It only takes less than 20 minutes to walk to the sea to watch the night view.Thank you very much for your booking."
0,"按常理赣州饭店应该是赣州最好的宾馆,但我错了!它是我住过的最差的宾馆","According to common reasoning Ganzhou Hotel, it should be the best hotel in Ganzhou, but I am wrong! It is the worst hotel I have lived in"
1,距离北站和长途客运站都很近，房间也很干净，只是不含早餐的房价相对没有竞争力。,"It is very close to the North Station and the long -distance passenger station, and the room is very clean, but the house prices that do not include breakfast are relatively competitive."
1,总体感觉还可以，对得起它的星级。房间比较大，就是卫生间太小，不太相称。,"Overall feeling is okay, worthy of its stars.The room is relatively large, that is, the bathroom is too small and is not very good."

1,中银大厦的前台服务态度非常好。及时帮我解决了预定问题。我很满意保定市区最好的饭店就是中银了，四星标准。到保定，就住中银大厦把，也没有其他选择了,"The front desk service attitude of BOC Building is very good.I helped me solve the scheduled problem in time.I am very satisfied with the best hotel in Baoding City is BOC, four -star standard.When I arrived at Baoding, I lived in the China Banking Building, and there were no other choices."
0,卫生条件太差，卫生间小，并且房间也不隔音，窗外人来人往影响休息,"The sanitary conditions are too poor, the bathroom is small, and the room is not sounded. People outside the window affect the rest"
0,这地方千万别去住了，绣花枕头一个。样子好看，。别的没什么的，大冷天不开空调还说他们觉得没必要开，气的你要死呢。第2天我就搬家了，,"Don't live in this place, embroidery the pillow.It looks good.There is nothing else. It is not necessary to open the air conditioner and say that they do n’t think it is necessary to drive. You are angry.I moved on the second day,"

0,酒店不开夜床，我大约晚上11到酒店，发现房间和出门时一样的乱，没人来打扫，浴袍是坏的（有两处破损的地方）也没人检查，早上用餐时被告之只含单早，后来把大堂经理叫来才弄明白，要登记的时候出示两张身份证才能含双早，（但问题是我在办理入住时是给了两张身份证，但大堂的登记那位说只要一张身份证就可），堂堂的世界一流酒店管理集团希尔顿酒店会发生这样的气愤事件可让人无奈。。。。。。。。。,"The hotel does not open the night bed. I arrived at the hotel about 11 pm and found that the room was the same as when I went out. No one came to clean it. The bathrobe was bad (there were two damaged places).It only contained a single early, and later called the lobby manager to understand that when you had to register, two ID cards were displayed to include double early early. (But the problem was that I gave two ID cards when I handled it, but the registration of the lobby was registered in the lobby.The one said that as long as a ID card can be available), this angry incident in Hilton, a world -class hotel management group in the dignified world, is helpless.EssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssence"

0,位置不是很好，交通一般，离地铁站比较远，一般只能打车，房间里空调老化，一晚上不停的响，还有蚊子，刚进房间就发现被单上有很大块的污渍，后来叫服务生才还掉的，感觉不是很好。,"The location is not very good. The traffic is average. It is relatively far from the subway station. Generally, you can only take a taxi. The air -conditioning in the room is aging. It is constantly ringing all night, and there are mosquitoes.

1,"酒店位置很好，不管是购物还是用餐，都非常方便；服务也不错，前台和客房服务员都很热情。21层的高级间房间很大，设施也不错；水龙头很特别，水压很大，洗澡特别舒服。但也有急需改进之处，一是床垫已经变形了，睡在上面感觉坑坑洼洼的很难受，经服务员多次处理后，问题基本得以解决；二是房间的门好像不太隔音，白天午睡的时候时常会被服务员的推车声和说话声吵醒。总的来说，性价比还可以，比在“银河王朝”住得舒服。另外提醒一点，千万别在四楼的中餐部用餐，贵得吓死人不说，还巨难吃！！！宾馆反馈2008年6月1日：尊敬的宾客:您好!感谢您下榻成都新良大酒店!对你提出的意见,酒店十分重视,已经对楼层布草车进行了减噪改造,尽量避免员工在工作中给您带来的诸多不便.位于酒店二楼的西餐厅已经开业了,欢迎您的再次光临!","The hotel location is very good, whether it is shopping or dining, it is very convenient; the service is also good, and the front desk and the guest room waiters are very enthusiastic.The high -end room on the 21st floor is large and the facilities are good; the faucet is very special, the water pressure is very large, and the bath is particularly comfortable.However, there are also urgent need for improvement. One is that the mattress has been deformed, and it feels uncomfortable to sleep on it.

1,面对大海很舒服.周围环境也很不错.客房也就3.5星.早餐也实在没档次.,Facing the sea is very comfortable. The surrounding environment is also very good. The guest rooms are 3.5 stars. Breakfast is really no grade.

1,据说是当地最好的酒店了，挂三。我们住的豪标。优点：酒店环境尚可，房间大。缺点：离景区有25分钟左右路程，位置不佳，尤其想要在古镇看夜景的话不建议住这里。,"It is said to be the best local hotel, hanging three.We live.Advantages: The hotel environment is acceptable, the room is large.Disadvantages: There are about 25 minutes away from the scenic area. The location is not good. I especially want to live here if you want to see the night view in the ancient town."
0,我是5/2日入住的该酒店的大床间，优点：酒店周围比较安静，周边环境还可以。缺点：1）酒店比较偏僻，离市区和景点都有相当的距离。去哪儿都不方便，除了在园区上班的。2）酒店服务质量非常一般，前台阿门童阿都是冷冰冰的。3）房间比较小，设施一般，只有淋浴没有浴缸，而且淋浴房的角落非常脏，都生青苔了。4）酒店很多方面不够人性化，比如卫生间没有备用手纸，房间内拖鞋，发梳等东西只放了一套，如果入住两个人的话需要打电话再要一套。5）最不满意的就是酒店的空调和相关服务了，入住的时候我被安排入住2211房间，入住时大概是7点多，房内温度26，入住后大约半小时，温度升为27，以为是自己空调操作有误，翻阅酒店相关服务手册，未发现如何使用。（个人感觉是这个房间的空调有问题，因为空调就两个控制开关，一个控制风速，一个控制制冷/热。）打电话给客房中心，说让服务员来看一下。服务员来后，给我查看及设置了一下，并说我原来的设置没什么问题，问其为何温度降不下来，答曰酒店的中央空调降温比较慢。让我等等，如果不降温再联系客房中心。大约半小时之后，房内温度升至28，为了确认是空调的问题，我就把空调关了，大约半小时之后，温度降至26度。（看来空调是在升温而不是降温）但还是热的受不了，再次联系客房服务反映问题，答曰：你开窗试试。（既然只能开窗降温，要空调何用，残念）我再问：开窗之后呢？既不情愿地答曰：我找技术人员来看看。按照九点指示开窗，温度很快降到26，大约9点半，技术人员来了，不做任何询问，就用个吸尘器吸了下空调的吸风口。问其是否是空调的问题，答曰：应该是吸风口灰太多，空气不能流通的原因，在等一会温度就会下来的。（就算是灰尘的问题，也应该在日常维护中预防，而不是等客人来了反应，而且后来事实证明应该不是这个问题造成空调不能制冷只能制热）。“技术人员”走后大约1小时，温度再次上升至27度（“看来弄一下吸风口还是能稍微减缓一点升温的速度”）。在次联系客房服务，答曰：我们让“技术人员”来看一下。几分钟之后，刚才的技术人员又来了，他先把出风口也弄了一下，然后在他的要求下，把房间内的灯都关了，说是灯的发热量大，温度打不下来。（真是荒谬的可以）“技术人员”走后半小时，温度还是保持在27度，没有任何降低的迹象，再次联系酒店，酒店才极不情愿的给我换了个房间，这个时候已经是11点半。6）还有很多其他小缺点就不一一列举了。总结：酒店的“技术人员”水平很低，酒店缺乏日常维护，服务人员缺乏应有的职业素质。一个人的问题可能还是个人问题，但整个酒店的各方个面都有问题，就应该是管理层的问题了。强烈不推荐该酒店。,"I am the big bed where the hotel stays at the 5/2 on the 5th. The advantages: the hotel is relatively quiet, and the surrounding environment is OK.Disadvantages: 1) The hotel is relatively remote, and there is a considerable distance from the urban area and attractions.It is inconvenient to go anywhere, except to work in the park.2) The quality of hotel services is very general. The front desk Amen Tong Abu is cold.3) The room is relatively small, the facilities are average, only the shower has no bathtub, and the corner of the shower room is very dirty, all moss.4) The hotel is not human in many aspects. For example, there is no spare hand paper in the bathroom, slippers in the room, and hair combing. If you stay in two people, you need to call another set.5) The most dissatisfied is the hotel's air conditioner and related services. When I stayed in, I was arranged to stay in Room 2211. The time was about 7 o'clock.It is wrong with the air conditioning operation of myself. I read the hotel -related service manual and did not find how to use it.(Personally, there is a problem with the air conditioning of this room, because the air conditioner is two control switches, one controls the wind speed, and the other controls the cooling/heat.) Call the guest room center and let the waiter take a look.After the waiter came, I checked and set it up, and said that my original settings were fine. Asked why the temperature could not be reduced, and the central air conditioner of the hotel was relatively slow.Let me wait, and contact the room center if you don't cool down.After about half an hour, the temperature in the room rose to 28. In order to confirm that it was an air conditioner, I turned off the air conditioner. After about half an hour, the temperature dropped to 26 degrees.(It seems that the air conditioner is heating up rather than cooling.) But it still can't stand it. Contact the room service to reflect the problem again.(Since you can only open the window to cool down, what is the use of air conditioning, disabled) I asked again: After opening the window?Nothing to answer: I will find a technician to see.According to the instructions of nine o'clock, the temperature quickly dropped to 26, about 9:30. The technicians came. Without any inquiries, they took the air -conditioned air -conditioning mouth with a vacuum cleaner.Asked if it is an air conditioner, the answer: It should be the reason why the air is too gray, and the air cannot flow, and the temperature will come down for a while.(Even if it is a dust problem, it should be prevented in daily maintenance, not waiting for the guest to respond, and later it proves that it should not cause the air conditioner to refrigerate and only heated it).About 1 hour after the ""technical personnel"", the temperature rose to 27 degrees again (""It seems that it can still slow down the air inlet and the temperature can be slightly relieved"").Contact the room service in the secondary room and answer: Let's let the ""technical staff"" look at it.A few minutes later, the technicians of the technicians just came again. He first got the air outlet again, and then turned off the lights in the room at his request.Essence(Really ridiculous) Half an hour after the ""technical personnel"", the temperature remained at 27 degrees without any signs of lowering. When you contact the hotel again, the hotel was reluctant to change the room.Half.6) There are many other small shortcomings.Summary: The level of ""technical personnel"" of the hotel is very low, the hotel lacks daily maintenance, and the service staff lacks due professional quality.A person's problem may still be a personal problem, but there are problems with all parts of the entire hotel, which should be a management problem.The hotel is not recommended."
1,房间感觉很上海化，结构紧凑，服务态度尚可，大厅也不错，是个标准的四星酒店。只是周边环境不是特别的优雅，如果只是对房间内部要求比较高的朋友，可以考虑。附近有一个新天地步行街的地方，可以在那边用餐，因为酒店内部中餐和西餐味道都不尽如人意，西餐分量少的可怜，感觉是用咖啡杯盘子盛菜，而中餐价格相对低一点，味道却都比较咸，很多菜都要放酱油，包括炒饭在内。酒店人员素质感觉亲和力有待改进，有时候给人一种冷冰冰的感觉。房间的网络是要收费的，1分钟1块钱，一天包是60块。对网络有要求的朋友应该要好好考虑一下是否愿意接受，不过毕竟在上海这种城市，几乎是找不到免费的服务的。酒店背后就是个中学，有时候会感觉有点吵闹，而且现在中学旁边有工地面对酒店在施工。,"The room feels very Shanghai, the structure is compact, the service attitude is acceptable, and the hall is also good. It is a standard four -star hotel.It's just that the surrounding environment is not particularly elegant. If you are only friends who have higher requirements in the room, you can consider it.There is a place where Xintian is on the streets nearby. You can dine there, because the Chinese food and Western food inside the hotel are not satisfactory. The western food is poor. It feels like a coffee cup plate is served. The price of Chinese food is relatively low.The taste is relatively salty. Many dishes have to be soy sauce, including fried rice.The quality of hotel personnel feels that the affinity needs to be improved, and sometimes it gives people a cold feeling.The network of the room is charged, 1 yuan for 1 minute, and 60 yuan a day.Friends who have requirements for the Internet should consider whether they are willing to accept it, but after all, in cities such as Shanghai, there are almost no free services.Behind the hotel is a middle school, sometimes it feels a little noisy, and now there is a construction site next to the middle school to face the hotel construction."
1,位置较中心，服务也可以，大楼也气派，就是地毯比较灰暗，房间从门口到里面的走廊较窄。,"The location is more central, the service is also available, and the building is also elegant, that is, the carpet is relatively dark, and the corridor from the door to the corridor is narrow."
1,"相对价钱,酒店真的不错,交通方便,干净整洁,","Relative price, the hotel is really good, convenient for transportation, clean and tidy,"
1,感觉还算可以的，不过没有香格里拉那么好，价格和协议的也没什么区别．所以还是去香格里拉较划算点．,"It feels okay, but it is not as good as Shangri -La, and there is no difference between the price and the agreement.So it is more cost -effective to go to Shangri -La."
1,总体上觉得还可以，但我觉得服务还是未能跟上，泡温泉的地方提供的毛巾不够，服务员也少，不过环境不错。我退房的时候太慢了，催了好几次才检查房间。其实温泉里是有大排档的，在度假村往温泉的路上就能看到有两家大排档，味道还可以，价格还是很合理的，但要吃鸡的话，我就觉得贵了一点，不过还挺方便的。,"Generally I think it is okay, but I think the service still failed to keep up. The towels provided by the hot spring are not enough, and the waiters are less, but the environment is good.I was too slow when I got out of the room. I urged several times to check the room.In fact, there are large stalls in the hot springs. You can see two stalls on the way to the hot spring on the road to the hot spring. The taste is okay. The price is still very reasonable, but if you want to eat chickenPretty convenient."
0,我是代同事们预订此酒店，之前听说此酒店不错，但没想到几次打电话到酒店咨询事情，前台服务员的态度非常不耐烦，非常差。作为酒店，前台是举足轻重的部门，竟然有这样的服务，令我非常失望。,"I booked this hotel on behalf of my colleagues. I heard that this hotel was good before, but I did not expect to call the hotel to consult a few times. The attitude of the front desk waiter was very impatient and very bad.As a hotel, the front desk is a pivotal department, and there is such a service that makes me very disappointed."

1,这个宾馆总体感觉还不错，无论从价格、出行、购物，还是订机票（国航就在它的右边）都很方便。只是房间没有什么电脑，也不知道它说的免费上网在什么地方可以。补充点评2007年10月12日：对了，去机场也很方便，机场大巴就在它下面，每半个小时一趟,"This hotel feels pretty good. It is convenient to make a ticket from price, travel, shopping, or booking tickets (Air China on its right).It ’s just that there are no computers in the room, and I do n’t know where it can be used for free Internet access.Supplementary comment on October 12, 2007: By the way, it is also convenient to go to the airport. The airport bus is under it."
0,"上当了,这家酒店根本评不上四星,早饭只有稀饭馒头干面包,连牛奶都没有,服务员在打闹,以为进了一家招待所(实际上也就是,侧门挂着中共酒店委员会的大牌子,太夸张了,好象央企!)吃完了敏感的LP就肚子不舒服!因为不想麻烦就算了.床单被子是印有孔子出游图案的,又硬又有香烟味,整晚无法入睡.携程预订时说明是宽带免费才订的大床房,结果服务台说收费的,结果争了半天直到要向携程投诉才假装查电脑后说免费.另外,所谓环保酒店就是走廊黑灯瞎火的等人来了感应才开,节能是节能了,偏偏酒店走廊特长,没人时黑得不敢走出门,不安全!所谓大床房就是普通标间换成大床,而且房间沿街,但价格几乎翻番,早提醒我啊!请大家不要去住,实际上曲府很小,住那里都不远,按协程推荐或会员好评的住!鲁能在当地投资了一家五星酒店在试营业,就在孔庙西,请大家留意.","If you are on, this hotel can not evaluate four stars at all. There is only porridge steamed bread bread for breakfast. There is no milk. The waiter is making trouble, thinking that he has entered a guest house (in fact, the side door is hung on the large brand of the CCP hotel committee.It ’s too exaggerated, it seems like a central enterprise!) After eating the sensitive LP, I’ m uncomfortable! Because I do n’t want to trouble it, even if the sheet quilt is printed with the Confucius travel pattern, it is hard and cigarette, and I cannot fall asleep all night.The time explanation is a large bed that was booked free of charge. As a result, the service desk said that it was charged. As a result, it was for a long time until the complaint from Ctrip before pretending to check the computer for free. In addition, the so -called environmentally friendly hotel was the dark light of the corridor.Only when it is opened, energy saving is energy -saving, but the specialties of the hotel corridor. No one dares to go out of the door when there is no one. It is not safe! The so -called large bed room is a normal bedroom to replace it with a large bed, and the room is along the street, but the price is almost doubled.I! Please do n’t live. In fact, Qufu is very small and lives not far away. It is recommended or praised by the members of the coroutine!

0,上海的商务成本越来越高这样差的酒店，居然也能得到不错的评价吃：早餐不是一般的难吃住：床特别的不舒服行：打的一般，需要走段路提醒：前台的服务特别差。,"Shanghai's business costs are getting higher and higher, so hotels that are poor can actually get good evaluation: breakfast is not ordinary unpleasant and uncomfortable: bed is particularly uncomfortable.Especially poor."
1,我们6人在金版纳住了3个晚上，大家都比较满意。房间稍微有点小，但相对于其价格已经很不错了。地点也不错。还有个比较大的游泳池。餐厅很好。我们在餐厅吃过一次午餐，无论是服务和菜都很好。唯一的问题是餐厅太出名了（被评为当地的最佳婚宴餐厅，所以晚餐一般都被包去举行婚宴。所以我们住了3个晚上居然没能在酒店餐厅吃上一次晚餐）。,"We lived in the gold version for 3 nights, and everyone was more satisfied.The room is a bit small, but it is already very good than its price.The location is also good.There is also a relatively large swimming pool.The restaurant is very good.We have had lunch in the restaurant, both services and dishes.The only problem is that the restaurant is too famous (being rated as the best local wedding banquet restaurant, so dinner is generally packed to hold a wedding banquet. Therefore, we lived for 3 nights and could not have dinner in the hotel restaurant)."
1,"设施不新,房间大小适中,都是侧看海景,有无烟层.早餐比较普通,选择不多.","The facilities are not new, the room size is moderate, and the seascape is all on the side. There are no smoke layers. Breakfast is more ordinary. There are not many choices."
0,房间陈旧，设施简单，尤其是早餐品种极少，但能吃饱。服务人员主动服务意识差，但你主动的话她们倒是比较热情。可能是黄山游客多，酒店生意好，你下次来不来住无所谓。酒店的院落大，停车方便，环境较佳。因他们不是专业酒店，所以要原谅包涵他们。,"The room is old and the facilities are simple, especially the breakfast varieties are very small, but they can eat.The service staff has a poor awareness of service, but if you take the initiative, they are more enthusiastic.It may be that there are many tourists in Huangshan, and the hotel business is good. It doesn't matter if you come to live next time.The courtyard of the hotel is large, the parking is convenient, and the environment is better.Because they are not professional hotels, they must forgive them."
1,在当地这已经算是不错的了，看宣传资料：国家领导也下榻这里，夫复何求？由于到时较晚，餐厅备料几尽，厨师也只剩一人，好歹弄桌吃食――岂料来客皆饕餮，转眼风扫残云。再唤上菜，厨师已回家拜拜。经一番扰攘，终于“二次大战”遂“谈笑凯歌还”。早餐比较丰盛，只是牛奶不是习惯的味道（也不象是奶粉沏的――不知道是怎么回事儿）。临时安排了一个活动晚宴，店方的努力有目共睹。只是席间有录象时，服务员出出进进影响不好，让主办者十分不快，但反复提醒后有改进――善莫大焉。总体感觉不错――带有身份的客人，还是选此店。,"This is a good local. Look at the promotional information: The national leaders are also staying here.Because it was late, the restaurant had a few preparations, and there was only one chef. Anyway, he could eat the table -unexpectedly, the guests were all stubborn, and the wind swept the clouds.Call the food again, and the chef has returned home to worship.After some disturbances, he finally ""Talking and laughing Kay Ge back"".Breakfast is more abundant, but milk is not used to the taste (not like milk powder -I don't know what's going on).An event dinner was temporarily arranged, and the store's efforts were obvious to all.However, when there was a video during the dignitar, the waiter had a bad impact on development, which made the organizer very unhappy, but after repeated reminders, there was improvement -goodness.Overall feels good -guests with identity still choose this shop."
1,"根本够不上五星,充其量四星,五一去大热的天居然不开空调,热的无法睡觉,只好起床就走,可电梯又贼慢,服务态度倒是不错,地理条件也可以,冬天去可能还行.","It is not enough to get five stars at all. At best, the day of May, the hot day does not turn on the air conditioner.It may be okay."
0,网上订的，注明早晨8点入住，9点多才有房间。与约好的人谈完事后，因急于赶到下一个城市办事，于下午1点左右退房，本以为付半天的房费就可以了，居然被要求付全天的房费。不知是什么规矩，携程下面还有这样的合作酒店？让人感觉不舒服。,"In the online booked, it is indicated at 8 o'clock in the morning, and there is only a room at 9 o'clock.After talking to the people who had a good appointment, because they were anxious to rush to the next city to work, they checked at around 1 pm. I thought that the house fee for a long time was enough.I don't know what the rules are, there are such cooperative hotels below Ctrip?It makes people feel uncomfortable."
1,"已经多次入住了,在徐州是一家不错的酒店,环境雅致,早餐也不错,有当地的特色.","I have stayed many times. In Xuzhou, it is a good hotel. The environment is elegant and breakfast is good. There are local characteristics."
0,海天的房间比较小，因为是在中间，所以采光也不是很好，里面的设施不太好，地毯很脏，我住的那间热水管坏了，但因为当时同屋的已经睡了，所以也没有去换，但是心情就不好了。最不喜欢的是他们的服务态度，因为我们整理东西，所以晚下来了15分钟，这期间也没有电话提醒说必须马上下来，但到了前台后就被它们不停的质问：怎么这么晚才下来，！语气很不好，而且被问了三遍，前台小姐问了两遍，脸很臭，后来有一个男的不知是不是前台，嘴里还叼着烟，又问了我们一遍。当时就觉得特别火，住了这么多酒店，还从没见过质问住客的呢，以后不会再去这家了。,"Haitian's room is small, because it is in the middle, so the lighting is not very good.So I didn't change it, but my mood was bad.The most dislike is their service attitude, because we sort it out, so I came down for 15 minutes late. During this period, there was no phone reminder that we must come down immediately, but after the front desk, they kept questioning: Why come down so late to come down so late!The tone was very bad, and I was asked three times. The front desk lady asked twice, and her face was stinky. Later, a man did not know if he was the front desk. He was cigarette in his mouth and asked us again.At that time, I felt particularly hot. I stayed in so many hotels and never saw the guests. I won't go to this house in the future."
1,个人觉得还是不错的，在风景区旁边，吃玩都比较大方便。服务挺好的，我们4月去的，空调全部是冷气了，我们说冷，服务员就送了电暖器过来。房间比较干净，不过不建议住山景房，窗户后面就是小秃山，景观房不错的，而且如果住在二楼的话，还有一个阳台，总体感觉不错，值得推荐!,"Personally, I think it ’s good. It is more convenient to eat and play next to the scenic area.The service was very good. We went in April. All the air conditioners were air -conditioned. We said that cold, and the waiter sent an electric heater.The room is relatively clean, but it is not recommended to live in a mountain view room. Behind the window is small bald mountains, the landscape room is good, and if you live on the second floor, there is still a balcony, it feels good overall, it is worth recommending!"
0,纯粹就是国企招待所的作风和质量.整个酒店看上去显得比较陈旧.,It is purely the style and quality of the State -owned Enterprise Guest House. The entire hotel looks more old.
1,喜来登的总体还是不错的，比较这个酒店时间久了，比较老。早餐还是不错。不过，在东北这个还算可以的。,"The overall of Sheraton is still good. Compared with this hotel for a long time, it is older.Breakfast is still good.However, this is okay in the Northeast."
1,这个酒店位置很好，就在新街口附近，走到哪里都近，吃饭也方便。酒店员工服务也很好，主管顾新峰当时帮我做的入住，因为他们在做酒店改造，就帮我免费升级了！客房的服务员也是相当的周到，到了之后的服务让我十分的满意。送来的报纸还配上一个有淡淡香味的花，让人感觉宾之如归。真的是一个值得推荐的酒店。我在协程虽然不算资深会员级别，但是也用协程3年了。这是第一次上来点评，就是因为服务真的很出众。让我觉得这钱花得不冤枉。,"This hotel location is very good. It is near Xinjiekou. It is close to wherever you go, and it is convenient to eat.The hotel employee service is also very good. The supervisor Gu Xinfeng helped me move in at that time, because they were making hotel transformation, and they helped me upgrade for free!The waiter in the guest room is also quite thoughtful, and the service after arrival makes me very satisfied.The delivered newspapers are also equipped with a faint fragrance, which makes people feel that guests are like returning.It is really a recommended hotel.Although I am not a senior member level at the coroutine, I have also used the coroutine for 3 years.This is the first time coming up, because the service is really outstanding.Make me feel that the money is not wrong."
1,8号入住的海景，吃过晚饭匆匆赶回酒店，连林岛路口“威海宾馆”硕大的牌子几乎遮掉了海景小小的指路牌，建议酒店这个钱一定不能省！服务很好，一入住就送水果和茶水毛巾，还有小礼物，很喜欢。房间设施不错，但是电视剧太糟糕了，还不是纯平的，是以前那种“直角平面”！我就用这个电视机看完了奥运会的开幕式，不得不说是一个遗憾！才知道有免费洗车的服务，没享受到啊，建议以后可以给开车的客人一个提醒。,"The sea view on the 8th, hurried back to the hotel after dinner, and the huge brand of Lianlin Island's ""Weihai Hotel"" almost covered the small finger sign of the sea view. It is recommended that the hotel's money must not be saved!The service is very good. As soon as you check in, you will give fruit and tea towels, as well as small gifts. I like it very much.The room facilities are good, but the TV series is too bad, not pure, it is the ""right -angle plane"" before!I used this TV to watch the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games, and I have to say that it is a pity!I only know that there is a free car washing service. I haven't enjoyed it. It is recommended to give a reminder to the guests who drive."
1,收不到中央电视台，跟前台反映了一下，说去看一下，第二晚住还是没有修好。,"Can't receive CCTV, reflect the front desk, say that you still have not repaired the next night."
0,"没有想到携程会提供这样的酒店,房间小,卫生差,毛巾和床单都有可疑的污渍,走廊和房间都有味,卫生间就更不用说了!跟周围50-90元的宾馆没有什么区别,酒店的大门上挂着88元特价标准间!我们是凌晨2点入住的,房间非常不隔音,住在走廊的尽头,","I did not expect that Ctrip would provide such a hotel, small rooms, poor sanitation, towels and sheets with suspicious stains. The corridors and rooms were tasteful, let alone the bathroom! No different differences from the hotels around 50-90 yuan.There are 88 yuan special price rooms on the door of the hotel! We stayed at 2 am at 2 am. The room was very sound insulation."
0,员工素质很差。虽然通过携程订了酒店后。到期后想延住，携程通知了没有房间，于是我想通过前台再看看能不能有房间，实在不行再搬也行。结果前台有两个员工说话很不礼貌，说我爱住不住，他们没房间就要让我退房，后来销售解决问题后，我还算满意，结果今天一给酒店打电话，才发现又被那个销售骗了。当时答应说给我订房，还跟我确认了价格，结果其实根本就没订，还说跟我说的是下次如果我再订，他再帮我安排，再也没有下次了。如果不讲信用的酒店。根本没法住。,"The quality of employees is poor.Although the hotel was booked through Ctrip.After expiry, I wanted to delay, and Ctrip informed that there were no rooms, so I wanted to see if there was a room through the front desk, it would not work.As a result, two employees in the front desk were very impolite, saying that I couldn't hold it. They had to check out if they had no room. After the sales solved the problem, I was quite satisfied. As a result, I called the hotel today and found that I found that againHe was cheated by that sales.At that time, I promised to say that I reached a house and confirmed the price with me. As a result, I did n’t book it at all. I also said that what I told me is that if I book again, he will help me arrange it again, and I will never be next time.If you don't talk about a credit hotel.Can't live at all."
1,性价比可以，让人有还想再入住的感觉，在北京这个价格的酒店中，服务算还不错的,"The cost -effectiveness is OK, it makes people feel like I still want to stay again. In this hotel in Beijing, the service is not bad"
0,我是3月18日入住的，住了4天，宾馆是在一个小区边上，基本上算是一个小区的楼改的宾馆。门口有一个高高的台阶，大厅很小，根本不够三星酒店的标准。但房间还是可以的，全木制的装修，勉强可以。点餐贵的要命，一盘蛋炒饭敢要14一盘，一份炒菜基本都在38元以上。早餐更差了，我8点就餐，基本就我一个人，入住率很低。我住的是188的豪华单间，结算的时候才知道，单间的门市价才198，只便宜了10块钱。每次打车司机都说188的价格偏高了，实际常来的能到一百二三。,"I stayed on March 18th and lived for 4 days. The hotel was beside a community. It was basically a hotel reform in a community.There is a high step at the door. The lobby is very small, which is not enough for the standard of the Samsung Hotel.But the room is still possible. All wooden decoration is barely.The order of order is expensive. A plate of egg fried rice dares to be 14, and a piece of cooking is basically more than 38 yuan.Breakfast is even worse. I ate at 8 o'clock, and I was basically alone, and the occupancy rate was very low.I live in the luxury single room of 188. I only learned that the price of the single room was only 198, only 10 yuan cheaper.Every time a taxi driver said, the price of 188 is high, and the actual one can actually reach 123."
0,只有一个好处离虹桥很近.....赶早飞机不用起太早......,Only one benefit is very close to Hongqiao ...
1,房间尚可，环境也不错，只是周边环境不够理想！稍微差了点！,"The room is okay, and the environment is also good, but the surrounding environment is not ideal!Slightly worse!"
1,首先酒店有免费的接送服务，这点很好，但是要自己去联络酒店方面，携程的服务人员根本不知道有这项服务。第二，酒店服务不错，会放点糖果，卡片等，感觉贴心。走廊上碰到所有的服务人员都会很热情的打招呼。第三，酒店所在位置不错，门口就有到各个景点的公交。第四，表扬左岸咖啡厅的早点，式样多，味道好，靠窗有舒服的沙发位子。是对着白鹭洲的景观位子。但桌子和沙发离得太远，我娇小的中国体型感觉有点够不着。酒店改进一下，毕竟还是中国人来得多嘛！缺点：我定的是景观大床房，可床一点都不大。就四星级酒店来说，设施陈旧，电视居然还是球面的，色彩差。卫生间小，没有独立的淋浴房。排风声音响，开门后会闻到霉味。,"First of all, the hotel has a free pick -up service, which is good, but to contact the hotel by themselves, Ctrip's service staff does not know that this service has this service.Second, the hotel service is good, you will put some candy, card, etc., feel intimate.All the service staff in the corridor will say hello enthusiastically.Third, the hotel is located in a good position, and there is a bus at the door at the door.Fourth, praise the early points of the left bank cafe, many styles, good taste, and comfortable sofa seats by the window.It is facing the landscape seat in Bailin.But the table and sofa are too far away, and my petite Chinese body feels a little bit enough.The hotel improves, after all, it is still a lot Chinese!Disadvantages: I set a large landscape bed room, but the bed is not large at all.As far as four -star hotels are concerned, the facilities are old, and the TV is actually the spherical, and the color is poor.The bathroom is small and there is no independent shower room.The sound sound sounds, it will smell the smell after opening the door."
1,安全周到早餐也越做越好所以连续住过几次都不想更换别的酒店价格也适中,"Safe and thoughtful breakfast also get better and better, so I do n’t want to change the price of other hotels a few times in a row."
0,挂的是四星，但房间的家具及家居用品都很差，象招待所的设备；而且电视还是放在像衣柜的柜子里，要看电视还要先打开柜门才能看，并且无免费矿泉水饮用。,"Four stars are hung, but the furniture and household items in the room are very poor, like the equipment of the guest house; and the TV is still placed in a wardrobe cabinet. You must first open the cabinet door to watch the TV, and there is no free mineral water.drink."
0,性价比差，酒店诚信更差，尝试住了一次决定不会再住下一次宾馆反馈2008年7月7日：客人原订标准双人间，到店后想改为大床房，此两种房型存在价格上的差别，因沟通上的差异造成了双方的误解。我们对此客人表示抱歉和遗憾。,"The price / performance ratio is poor, the hotel's integrity is even worse, I tried to live a decision to stay in the next hotel to feedback on July 7, 2008: The guest originally scheduled to be a standard double room, and I wanted to change to a large bed room after arriving.The difference in price caused misunderstandings due to the difference in communication.We apologize and regret this guest."
1,"比较满意,酒店比较新,房间也比较大,感觉还可以","It's relatively satisfactory, the hotel is relatively new, the room is relatively large, it feels okay"
0,因为去年住过，感觉房间好像装修过了。但是早餐好像和去年不一样了。我去的时候两个老外去了豪华的餐厅，我被安排在下面。。。早餐很差。。连沙拉都没有。。如果需要购买好一点的早餐，酒店应该先向顾客说明。,"Because I lived last year, I felt like the room was decorated.But breakfast seems to be different from last year.When I went, the two foreigners went to a luxurious restaurant, and I was arranged below.EssenceEssenceBreakfast is poor.EssenceThere is no salad.EssenceIf you need to buy a better breakfast, the hotel should explain to the customer first."
1,酒店比较老，设施一般，但是服务相当好，价格也比较合理。值得推荐。,"The hotel is relatively old, the facilities are average, but the service is quite good and the price is more reasonable.Recommended."
0,这个酒店很奇怪。要说呢也是很用心，细节都做得很不错，包括毛巾叠成各种小动物的形状，马桶里洒了玫瑰的花瓣。但服务就真的是很糟糕。酒店的环境也不好。看房间里的酒店介绍呢，说是凭房卡可以打八折玩海洋世界的各种项目，居然从订房到退房都没有一个工作人员告诉我们这件事。最离谱的是，居然在大厅看到一只老鼠！这个酒店很糟糕补充点评2008年1月25日：忘了说一点，前台的服务态度糟糕之外居然还很不专业。退房后回到酒店租酒店的车子到机场（车费100，倒是方便）时竟然问我要房卡，我很明确的告诉他们房卡已经还给他们并确认交还后，一个负责退房男士的和一个办理入住的小姐开始相互抱怨。。。。坐一边的我除了惊诧还是惊诧。。。。汗！等到上车并开出一段以后，司机也有趣，问我钱是不是已经付了，（他们让我已经付钱给前台，并有人出来签收后安排车子）然后还打电话回酒店确认我是不是已经付钱了。。。。瀑布汗！,"This hotel is strange.It is also very attentive, and the details are very good, including the shape of a towel stacked into a variety of small animals, and the petals of roses are sprinkled in the toilet.But the service is really bad.The environment of the hotel is not good.Looking at the hotel in the room, it is said that it can play a variety of projects in the ocean world with a house card. There is no staff who told us from ordering to check -out.The most outrageous is that I saw a mouse in the lobby!This hotel is bad. Complex comments on January 25, 2008: Forgot to say something, the front desk's service attitude is bad, but it is still very unprofessional.After checking out the hotel, I returned to the hotel to rent a hotel to the airport (the fare is 100, but it is convenient).

1,非常不错的酒店，环境很不错，就是房间稍微笑了些，但很干净。交通也比较方便宾馆反馈2008年4月14日：欢迎再次光临.,"The very good hotel, the environment is very good, the room smiled slightly, but it was clean.Transportation is also more convenient for hotel feedback on April 14, 2008: Welcome to visit again."
1,湖光山色几乎可以用完美来形容，客房是实实在在的江南木结构民居，非常干净，环境保护得非常好，员工也非常礼貌、服务不错，特别大的停车场，非常适合自驾游的朋友，其实酒店就在景区内，不过去景区需要买票。,"Lakes and mountains can be described almost perfectly. The guest room is a real Jiangnan wood structure residential house. It is very clean, environmental protection is very good, and employees are very polite and good. They are particularly large in parking lots.The hotel is in the scenic area, but you need to buy tickets to the scenic area."
0,查看了很多的游记，选择了这个酒店。很失望，建议以后大家不要住。到前台，前台小姐用广东话和同事交谈，才决定给我什么房间，我要求高点的楼层，给了我9楼，进门有一股烟味。房间很小，设施很差。从铜罗湾出来，要过天桥才能到酒店。每次买好东西回来，都要走天桥。宁愿住珀宁酒店，离崇光近，不用走天桥。由于是红眼航班，要求延弛退房，给孩子睡个午觉，也不肯，服务太差了，根本不到四星的标准，要是在海南，三星也不评不上啊！建议大家带孩子的话，不要住这个酒店。,"I checked a lot of travel notes and chose this hotel.Very disappointed, it is recommended that you do not live in the future.At the front desk, the front desk lady talked with my colleagues in Cantonese to decide what room to give me. I asked for a high floor and gave me a 9th floor. There was a smell of smoke in entering the door.The room is small and the facilities are poor.From the Tongluo Bay, you can go to the hotel to the hotel.Every time you buy something good, you have to go to the bridge.I would rather live in the Person Hotel and close to Sogo, do not need to walk on the bridge.Because it is a red -eye flight, it is required to relax and check out. It is not willing to sleep for a noon, but the service is too bad. It is less than the standard of four stars. If in Hainan, Samsung will not be evaluated!It is recommended that you bring your children, do not live in this hotel."
1,没说的，怎能一个好字了得。可能说香格里拉的环境吧，反正觉得住在这里很惬意。酒店的服务很好，床也很舒服。前面就是一个小草原，还有牛在里面迟早。周边的环境那是安静得不行。不过因为酒店是木结构，楼上走动的声音很容易传到楼下。,"No one said, how can I have a good word.Maybe Shangri -La's environment, anyway, it feels very comfortable to live here.The hotel's service is very good and the bed is very comfortable.There is a small grassland in front, and the cow will be sooner or later.The surrounding environment is so quiet.However, because the hotel is a wooden structure, the sound of walking upstairs is easy to pass downstairs."
1,"总体服务不错,就是房间隔音太差,走廊里的声音就像是在房间里一样,早餐也还可以","The overall service is good, that is, the sound insulation in the room is too poor. The sound in the corridor is like in the room."
0,先说一点好的，就是设施比较新。下面说不好的：1、位置比较差，在一条胡同里，很多出租车司机不知道。而且胡同口有一块机动车禁止入内的牌子，有些司机不肯开进去的话，行李多的朋友就麻烦了。2、酒店号称免费宽带，但是我住进去的时候却说没有网线了，说一共只有19根网线，我找了多次客房服务和总台都没有办法解决，最后只好给携程打了一个电话，携程帮我联系了以后就有人把网线送来了。怎么评价宾馆的服务呢？就一个字――贱！顺便表扬一下携程。3、我入住的时候是11月初，最低温度是6度，进房间后觉得有点冷，开了空调后觉得没有什么改善，于是打电话给客房服务。他们回答我说空调开了，不过只是送风，如果觉得冷的话把空调关掉会好点，还说不能开热空调，开空调必须要上面统一调度的。这是我碰到过的最烂的服务了。只住了一天，感觉很差，以后不会再考虑这个地方。,"Let's talk about a little bit, that is, the facilities are relatively new.The following is not good: 1. The location is poor. In a hutong, many taxi drivers don't know.Moreover, there is a brand of motor vehicles that prohibit entering in the Hutong. If some drivers are unwilling to drive in, friends with a lot of luggage will be troublesome.2. The hotel claims to be free broadband, but when I live in, I said that there are no network cables. There are only 19 network cables in total. I found many room services and the head office. I had to call Ctrip.After contacting me, someone sent the network cable.How to evaluate the service of the hotel?Just one word -cheap!By the way, praise Ctrip.3. When I stayed in early November, the minimum temperature was 6 degrees. I felt a little cold after entering the room. After turning on the air conditioner, I felt that there was no improvement, so I called the guest room service.They answered me and said that the air conditioner was turned on, but it was just sending the air. If it felt cold, it would be better to turn off the air conditioner. It was also said that the heat condition could not be turned on. The air conditioner must be uniformly scheduled.This is the worst service I have encountered.I only lived for a day and felt very bad. I won't consider this place in the future."
1,房间隔音不好，其他方面比较不错，不巧的是，我抵达当天正赶上哈市大批出租车休息，所以宾馆的地理位置好还是让我满意,"The room's sound insulation is not good. Other aspects are relatively good. Unfortunately, I arrived at Harbin Harbin to rest on the day of the day. Therefore, the geographical location of the hotel is good."
1,酒店的地段好，我们去周围的商务机构办事非常方便；楼下就是置地广场，有LV、gucci...一串高中档的专卖店，附近还有一家反斗星玩具店（小朋友多高兴呀）；房间装修有特色，浴室也很宽敞，服务质量较好，不少服务员能听普通话，但也有不少只讲英文的．缺点：不知什么原因，我们带去的两台笔记本都无法上网，还好酒店提供免费使用的笔记本，没有耽误事；中午酒店附近的街上十分拥挤，最好别出门；早餐品种较少；因高楼林立，大大的窗子只能经常拉着窗帘（窗子好象是封死的）。,"The hotel's location is good. It is very convenient to go to the surrounding business institutions; downstairs is the Square Square, with LV and Gucci ... a series of high school stalls, there is also a back fighting star toy shop (how happy the children are children,); The room decoration is unique, the bathroom is also very spacious, and the service quality is good. Many waiters can listen to Mandarin, but there are also many who only speak English.Disadvantages: For some reason, the two notebooks we have taken away cannot access the Internet. Fortunately, the hotel provides free use laptops without delay; the street near the hotel is very crowded, it is best not to go out; there are few breakfast varieties;The high -rise buildings are standing, and large windows can only often pull curtains (the window seems to be sealed)."
1,"环境和服务都还不错,对于商务旅行来说性价比也还可以",The environment and services are not bad. For business travel
1,为客户订的，反馈还不错。下次客人来，还订此酒店。,"Booking for customers, feedback is not bad.Next time the guests come, and order this hotel."
0,这个酒店就是招待所改建的，所以各项硬件设施非常简陋，关键是大门在二楼，也没有无障碍楼梯，背着行李上楼，更没有服务人员帮忙！晚上在一个居民区里休息，都不敢开窗户，总之，很不满意！,"This hotel was converted by the guest house, so various hardware facilities were very simple. The key was the door on the second floor. There was no barrier -free staircase. He went upstairs with luggage, and there was no service staff to help!Rest in a residential area in the evening, I dare not open the windows. In short, I am very dissatisfied!"
1,"没什么啦,如果你要感受大上海繁华时尚的一面,这里无疑是最佳的了。信价比还可以吧，毕竟这么黄金的地段而且交通超级方便，紧邻一号地铁的出口，几乎不费什么力就可以到达宾馆。我住过好几次了，不过打折下来568元的价位还是有点“吃血”的，所以也只敢在荷包比较鼓的时候，呵呵，比如发年终奖的这会儿，奢侈一回。宾馆内部设施干净、简洁，是我喜欢的那种，不过公共部位的空间狭小了一些，有“螺蛳壳里做道场”的感觉。毕竟，寸土寸金的地儿，可以理解。推荐如果你是SHOPPING狂人的话，这里很合适，左右前后都是店，还整天搞活动，你可以逛累了，回宾馆歇会儿再杀出去，哈哈！","Nothing, if you want to feel the prosperous and fashionable side of Shanghai, it is undoubtedly the best.The appointment is okay. After all, such a golden location is super convenient. It is close to the exit of the No. 1 subway. You can reach the hotel almost without any effort.I have lived several times, but the price of 568 yuan is a bit ""eating blood"" at the discount, so I dare to dare to be in the pocket, huh, such as the end of the year, extravagant.The internal facilities of the hotel are clean and concise, which is the kind I like, but the space of the public parts is narrower, and it feels like ""doing a dojo in the snail shell"".After all, it is understandable.It is recommended that if you are a mad man, it is very suitable here. It ’s all the shops around. You can do activities all day long. You can go to the hotel and go back to kill again, haha!"
1,"整体来说是一家中规中矩的四星级,在香洲的酒店来说算是好的了,没有明显的优点和缺点,反正去香洲的话肯定会住这个酒店","On the whole, it is a well -established four -star level. It is good at the hotel in Xiangzhou. There are no obvious advantages and disadvantages. Anyway, if you go to Xiangzhou"
1,总的来说，印象很好，房间干净整洁时尚，网络速度很快。对有些要求较高的客户，需要注意的是：洗浴用的花洒是固定的，不像一般淋浴头可以拿在手上冲洗。,"In general, the impression is very good, the room is clean, tidy and stylish, and the network speed is fast.For some customers with higher requirements, it is important to note that the shower for bathing is fixed, unlike ordinary shower heads that can be rinsed with in their hands."
1,大厅很有气派和情调，房间很宽敞，服务很好！电视好像与房间的装潢不协调，主要是太小了。总之是我所住的宾馆中比较好的一类。,"The hall is very elegant and mood, the room is spacious, and the service is very good!TV seems to be uncoordinated with the decoration of the room, mainly too small.In short, it is a better category in the hotel where I live."
1,房间很新，服务员水平也很高，物有所值。4楼房间太压抑，这次先进了4楼然后不满意很快换到10楼，感觉就好多了。房间临街不吵。酒店的资助晚餐便宜美味有很多海鲜，物超所值。补充点评2008年1月2日：这家酒店我经常入住。在开发区范围内是性价比最好的了。,"The room is new, the level of waiters is also very high, and it is worthwhile.The room on the 4th floor was too depressed. This time, I was advanced on the 4th floor and then changed to the 10th floor quickly. It felt much better.The room is not noisy.The hotel's funding for dinner is cheap and delicious, and there are many seafood, which is worthy of money.Supplementary comment on January 2, 2008: I often stay in this hotel.It is the best cost -effective within the development zone."
0,"很一般的设施,很陈旧.服务也很一般,价格和设施是完全不相关的一个酒店.不会再考虑去入住.","Very ordinary facilities, very old. The service is also very general. The price and facilities are a completely irrelevant hotel. I will not consider staying."
1,6月末到访苏州，下榻此店。感觉不错。房间虽小些，但实施齐全。晚上很安静。酒店的小庭院，有一古井，配些翠竹和绿植很有味道。出店行不远就是有名的观前街，散步购物都方便。,"Visit Suzhou at the end of June and stay in this shop.It feels good.Although the room is small, it is complete.It's quiet at night.The hotel's small courtyard has an ancient well, with some green bamboo and green plants.Not far away from the store is a famous Guanqian Street, and walking shopping is convenient."
0,房间隔音出奇的差，从来没有住过隔音这么差的酒店，左右隔壁房间的电视、说话声音，过道里的声音在房间里都能清晰听到，睡眠质量差的人，在这家别想睡好觉。早上很早楼道里就在吵啊吵的，晚上你辗转反侧时左右隔壁房间里此起彼伏的“嗯...嗯...此处省略2000语气词”根本让你无法入睡。,"The sound insulation of the room is surprisingly poor. There have never been hotels that have been so poor in sound insulation. The TV and speaking sounds in the room next door. The sound in the aisle can be clearly heard in the room. People with poor sleep quality. Don't want to sleep in this family. Don't want to sleep.Good.In the morning, I was noisy in the building. In the evening, when you tossed and turned around, there was a ""uh ... uh ... omitting 2000 tone words"" at all. """
1,酒店的设施稍微老了一点，是四星级酒店的一个附楼。但是服务不错，而且酒店的价格非常吸引人。下次还会入住的！补充点评2008年2月22日：我住的是150的。还不错，冬季里没用霉味！,"The hotel's facilities are a little older, and it is an attached building of a four -star hotel.But the service is good, and the price of the hotel is very attractive.I will stay next time!Supplementary comment February 22, 2008: I live 150.Not bad, there is no mildew in winter!"
0,"对这个酒店的失望是从踏入酒店后的第一分钟开始,一直持续到离开这个酒店后的一个半月,1)1月22日入住,下雪,下了车拿着行李,门童视而不见;2)大堂暖气不足,温度很低3)入住花了差不多二十分钟,其实前台客人并不多,主要是工作人员明显是生手,而且态度还很生硬4)半夜一点洗澡,没热水,打N多次电话,过了差不多半小时才有一个工程人员上来帮助解决问题5)上网,网络是坏的,同样需要工作人员搬开家具来维修6)终于要睡觉了,才发觉过道的等无法关掉,接着又让维修人员上来维修,结果是维修人员也无法解决问题,只能拔掉灯泡7)真正的噩梦是1月23日离开店结帐,首先我要找大堂经理对昨晚这些问题问个所以然,结果过了半小时才见到大堂经理,又过了半小时才决定给我打8折.结帐时,涮了第一次卡号称POS机坏了,我明明听到是连通了,但工作人员硬说没连通,结果又刷了第2次,结果我打电话到银行问,证明酒店的确是刷了我2次672元.大堂经理答应马上传真通知银行取消一次,结果离开武汉后酒店一直没退款,又打了无数次长途,终于退了款.我去银行核查,酒店是2月20日把手续发到银行的,款是2月28日到我帐的.真的是不明白,这种酒店怎么能开业接客.可不可思议的是这种酒店管理公司怎么还有人用?居然还五星标准,我看是4星的硬件,招待所的服务水准,连快捷酒店都比不上","The disappointment with this hotel is from the first minute after entering the hotel, and it continues until one and a half after leaving the hotel, 1) Check in January 22, snow, get out of the car and hold the luggage, the door of the door is not seen;2) The lobby is insufficient heating and the temperature is low. 3) It took about twenty minutes to stay in.I called N multiple calls, and after almost half an hour, there was a engineering staff to help solve the problem. 5) The Internet is bad. The network is bad, and the staff also needs to move the furniture to repair 6) Finally sleepingCan't turn it off, and then let the maintenance personnel come up to repair. As a result, the maintenance staff cannot solve the problem, and can only unplug the bulb 7.) The real nightmare is to leave the store on January 23. First of all, I want to find the lobby manager. Last nightThese questions were asked, so after half an hour, I saw the lobby manager, and after half an hour, I decided to give me 20 % off. When checking out, the first card was called the POS machine.It was connected, but the staff said that they did not connect, but the second time I brushed it for the second time. As a result, I called the bank to ask, proving that the hotel did brush me 672 yuan twice.As a result, the hotel has not refunded after leaving Wuhan, and I have played countless long distances. Finally, I retired. I went to the bank to check it. The hotel was issued to the bank on February 20.. I really don’t understand, how can this kind of hotel be opened to pick up customers. What is incredible is how this kind of hotel management company still uses it? Actually, it is a five -star standard. I think it is a 4 -star hardware, the service level of the hospitality, and even the quick hotel.Can't compare"
0,大堂是喧闹的，房间地毯是脏的，浴室淋浴龙头是坏的，毛巾是黄颜色的。补充点评2007年9月11日：虽然号称是5星级酒店，但是感觉其档次很低。很多欢场女子出入其中，让人又不安的感觉。,"The lobby is noisy, the carpet in the room is dirty, the shower faucet is bad, and the towel is yellow.Supplementary comment on September 11, 2007: Although it is known as a 5 -star hotel, it feels very low.Many women in and out of the happy field make people feel uneasy."
0,"首先酒店不好找,说是吴中路,其实应该是在在万源路上,其次,房间给人感觉不是很干净,墙面上的墙纸有点掉下来了,淋浴间的地上黑黑的斑点让人不敢蹋入,可能是装修时流下的油漆或是别的什么东东.......最恐怖的是睡到凌晨4点左右,好象被什么东西咬醒了,开灯一看,尽然是","First of all, the hotel is not easy to find. It is Wu Zhonglu. In fact, it should be on Wanyuan Road. Secondly, the room feels not very clean. The wallpaper on the wall is a bit falling.Dare not dare to turn in, it may be the paint flowing down during the decoration or what else ....... The most scary is to sleep until about 4 am, as if I was awakened by something.All, all"
0,酒店生意清淡，大堂里都没几个客人。房间倒是不小，但觉得被褥窗帘都灰蒙蒙的有股味道，不知道多久没人用了。酒店里的娱乐设施，包括游泳池，台球等等，都要收费。白天房间里没有空调。晚上的热水，要先放10分钟才会来。优点么，就是位置不错，出门就是老街，吃饭逛街还算方便。,"The hotel business is light, and there are few guests in the lobby.The room is not small, but I feel that the bedding curtains are gray. I don't know how long it is used.The entertainment facilities in the hotel, including swimming pools, billiards, and so on.There is no air conditioner in the room during the day.The hot water at night will be put in 10 minutes before it will come.The advantage is that the location is good. It is the old street when going out. It is convenient to eat and go shopping."
1,酒店环境硬件设施不错，前台服务一般，中午结账时间前台财务人员却不在，游泳池对住店客人还要收费，有些小气。,"The hotel's environmental hardware facilities are good, the front desk is generally service, but the front desk of the front desk at noon is not there. The swimming pool is charged for the guests of the store, a little stingy."
1,离海很近，设施已经很旧了。淡季住这里确实很便宜。,"It is very close to the sea, and the facilities are already old.It is really cheap to live here in the off -season."
1,"交通比较方便.机场班车就在门口(回程在对面中山酒店),去西湖/黄龙等就在酒店正对面坐K16.酒店方面中规中矩,有一定性价比,服务有待加强.下次去还会选.宾馆反馈2008年8月12日：非常感谢您选择入住我们酒店。在今后的服务中我们会加强培训，为宾客提供细致、周到、全面、快捷的服务。再一次感谢您的宝贵意见！衷心期待您的再次光临！","The transportation is more convenient. The airport shuttle is at the door (the return journey is opposite the Zhongshan Hotel), and go to West Lake/Huanglong, just take K16 directly opposite the hotel. The hotel is quite good, there is a certain cost -effective, and the service needs to be strengthened.Feedback on August 12, 2008: Thank you very much for choosing to stay in our hotel.In future services, we will strengthen training and provide guests with detailed, thoughtful, comprehensive and fast services.Thank you again for your valuable opinions!I sincerely look forward to your visit again!"
0,在携程订威龙原本看上了两点，一个是四星级别、一个是香港公司管理。住过之后发现名不副实。首先服务水平绝对没有香港服务的影子，即便是国内的中上等水平也谈不上。第一天晚上就在洗手间里消灭了一个巨大的蟑螂，我想四星酒店应该不会有蟑螂客人吧。虽然有个游泳池，公开的开放时间是每天下午一点到七点，但是在这个时间内从来都是客人到前台要求开游泳池，前台临时找人才打开的，而且池水很冷，一般人能有勇气跳下去的不多，游泳池也因此形同虚设。游泳池的顶棚已经发霉或掉皮，看了让人不爽。值得一提的倒是大堂的几个门童，因为酒店在小街里面，没有出租车，他们几次到大路上帮助客人打车。,"In the Ctrip, Whelong originally looked at two points, one was four -star level and the other was managed by Hong Kong companies.After living, I found that the name is not true.First of all, the service level is absolutely no shadow of Hong Kong services, and even the domestic and upper and middle -level levels cannot be talked about.On the first night, a huge cockroach was destroyed in the bathroom. I think there should be no cockroach guests in the four -star hotel.Although there is a swimming pool, the open opening time is from 1 o'clock to seven o'clock every day, but at this time, guests have always arrived at the front desk to ask for a swimming pool. The front desk is temporarily looking for talents.There are not many, so the swimming pool is also the same.The ceiling of the swimming pool has been moldy or peeled, and it is uncomfortable to see it.It is worth mentioning that several children in the lobby, because the hotel is in the street without taxis, they go to the road several times to help guests take a taxi."
1,早餐种类太少质量也太差，吃稀饭都没有一般的花生、酱菜、咸蛋、腐乳或油条配菜等，吃面包那个土司也是20年前的做法干的不得了，要了碗馄顿里面的馅还没有煮熟，这等于没吃！补充点评2008年8月13日：补充一点，很重要的是旅馆早餐的咖啡实在是难以入口，建议好好改进，这应该不难吧。,"The types of breakfast are too small and the quality is too poor. There are no ordinary peanuts, pickles, salted eggs, bean curd or fritter side dishes, etc. Eating porridge. It is also incredible to eat bread.The stuffing is not cooked yet, this is equivalent to not eating!Supplementary comment on August 13, 2008: In addition, it is very important that the coffee of hotel breakfast is really difficult to import. It is recommended to improve it well. This should not be difficult."
1,很不错的酒店。虽然离地铁站有一定距离，可是还是挺方便的。房间的床很大很舒服。但是相对的，别的空间就缩小了。。。不过我还是很喜欢那张床。。。早上服务员的声音有些响希望可以改进下,"Very good hotel.Although there is a certain distance from the subway station, it is quite convenient.The bed in the room is very comfortable.But in contrast, other spaces are narrowed.EssenceEssenceBut I still like that bed very much.EssenceEssenceThe sound of the waiter in the morning is a bit loud"
1,对酒店的服务非常满意，每次酒店服务人员提供的时间承诺都能遵守，非常难得,"I am very satisfied with the service of the hotel, and the time promise provided by the hotel service staff can be obeyed, which is very rare"
0,"一个字,烂,二个字,特烂,三个字,特别烂.这样的宾馆四星级?请携程别为了回扣向我们推荐垃圾宾馆.","One word, rotten, two words, special rotten, three words, especially rotten. Such a four -star hotel? Please do not recommend garbage hotels to us in order to rebate."
1,位置太偏，主要是洗温泉方便。浴室你也可泡。,"The position is too biased, mainly because it is convenient to wash hot springs.You can also soak in the bathroom."
1,酒店服务不错，本来我订的标间，到了之后我要求换成大床间，酒店爽快的帮我调换了。其他各方面服务也很到位，每天有报纸水果咖啡茶等免费供应。地理位置离市中心也很近。价格吗由于我也没有去别的地方问价格所以就不加评论。总体来说这次还是很满意的。,"The hotel service is good. I originally ordered the standard room. After that, I asked to change to a large bed, and the hotel helped me change it.Other aspects of services are also in place, and there are free supply such as newspapers, fruit coffee and tea every day.The geographical location is very close to the city center.Is the price because I did not go elsewhere to ask the price, so I do n’t add comments.Overall this time is still very satisfied."
1,连续2次都被分到了角落，总感觉从门缝小下面吹风近来，空调的控制也很奇怪。早晚餐还可以，淋浴的水太小。,"It was divided into the corner for two consecutive times. I always felt that the hair control from the slot from the door seam was recently, and the control of the air conditioner was also strange.It's okay for morning and breakfast, the water of the shower is too small."
1,房间很大，习惯了一般标准间的面积，一进门还真有点不适应。标间的床就像某些酒店的大床了，不知道大床间的床有多大。周围景色还好，我的房间对面是个体育场，远处有几座山，早晨起来感觉不错。我是去中州铝厂出差，很方便，对门就是铝厂的一个门口。有时候人会很多，像是旅游的样子，好像是去云台山的，可惜偶没有时间，呵呵！,"The room is very large, and is used to the area of the general standard room. It is a bit uncomfortable as soon as entering the door.The bed in the standard room is like a large bed in some hotels. I don't know how big the bed in the big bed is.The scenery around me is okay. Opposite my room is a stadium. There are several mountains in the distance. It feels good in the morning.I went to the Zhongzhou Aluminum Factory on a business trip, which is very convenient. The door is a door to the aluminum factory.Sometimes there will be a lot of people. It looks like traveling, it seems to go to Yuntai Mountain, but unfortunately there is no time, haha!"
1,我是7月上旬去过的，酒店的环境很适合度假。山清水秀，幽静非常。但房间就不敢恭维；一进房首先是地毯的霉味很大很大（我要求换房可是很多标间都一样），令人顶不顺。再有是灯光很暗，和房门锁不牢。还好服务员的服务意识和态度不错。值得安慰,"I have been in early July, and the environment of the hotel is very suitable for vacation.The mountains and rivers are beautiful.But the room dare not compliment; as soon as you enter the room, the mildew of the carpet is very large (I ask for changing a house, but many standard rooms are the same), which is uncomfortable.Then there is a dark light, and the room door is not lock.Fortunately, the waiter's service awareness and attitude are good.Worthwhile"
1,"算是蚌埠目前最好的酒店了吧,确实没有其他好住的地方,总体来讲还不错.","It is the best hotel in Bengbu. There are indeed there is no other good place. Generally speaking, it is not bad."
1,出差时住的，酒店地理位置不错，服务也很好,"When you live on a business trip, the hotel has a good geographical location and the service is also very good"
1,此酒点很不错，环境很好性价比高，下次还住,"This wine is very good, the environment is very good and cost -effective, I will live next time"
1,房间小了点，不过周围的环境很好，尤其是冰泉泳池，是城市里靠漂白粉来过滤的泳池所不能比的。如果餐厅的服务再能提高一点就好了。,"The room is a bit smaller, but the surrounding environment is very good, especially the Bingquan pool, which is incomparable to the swimming pool filtered by bleaching powder in the city.If the service of the restaurant can be improved a little bit."
1,很气派的酒店群。房间够大。唯一一点不足的地方是一个冷气口直接对着一张床！然后，酒店的早餐很少。而且，会在酒店里迷路。哈哈，因为太大了。,"Very elegant hotel group.The room is big enough.The only thing that is inadequate is that the air -conditioned mouth is directly facing a bed!Then there are few breakfast in the hotel.Moreover, you will get lost in the hotel.Haha, because it is too big."
0,还有，早餐稍晚点，就没什么可吃的了，做的也很一般,"Also, the breakfast is later, there is nothing to eat, and what you do is very general"
0,晚上12：30到的，前台不错，打了好多电话问路一直耐心回答，房间也不错挺干净，早上结账的时候太麻烦，态度也不好，地点离我要去的地方太远，建议大家第一次去问清楚，不要以为县政府就在边上就好像中心了，跑了一晚上的山路...,"It arrived at 12:30 in the evening, and the front desk was good. I called a lot of phone calls and kept answering patiently. The room was also good and clean. It was too troublesome to check out in the morning and the attitude was not good.The first time I asked, don't think that the county government is like a center on the side, running the mountain road for one night ..."
0,所谓的携程四星，电梯又小又脏，从电梯到楼道到房间充满低档招待所的味道，半夜2点居然有自称服务员（女）的人敲门，不会再住这家酒店了，对携程的推荐也表示怀疑！,"The so -called Ctrip four -star, the elevator is small and dirty. From the elevator to the corridor to the room full of low -end hospitality, there are people who claim to be a waiter (female) at 2 o'clock in the middle of the night. They will no longer live in this hotel.Recommendations are also doubtful!"
0,第一次，也是最后一次，服务与星级不成正比，房间设施也非常一般！,"The first time, the last time, the service is not proportional to the star, and the room facilities are very general!"
1,酒店咖啡厅的服务人员业务水平有待提高。有点酒单，但对客人点的酒，不知在哪，不知如何调配，给人感觉，整个酒店空有豪华装修，服务水平却未与之配套。,"The service level of the hotel cafe needs to be improved.I have a little wine list, but I do n’t know where or how to prepare the wine, I do n’t know how to prepare it. It feels that the entire hotel has luxurious decoration, but the service level is not matched."
0,酒店旧，服务差，餐厅垃圾！坑人！极力推荐不住！补充点评2006年9月30日：坑人行为：地下一楼按脚，按了后告诉我是30分钟一个钟的，然后泡药水要另外加了38一位，不问人就按摩头部，又是30一位，可是头部按摩前后就三分钟！坑人行为：租当地的一个车回北京，多加了我300元！服务差：到二楼餐厅用餐被从大厅赶出来，理由是大厅有筵席，问题是那时候都7点多了，整个大厅除了五六个在讨论八卦的服务员就我一个人！最后赶去一小包厢，电视又说坏了，说没有遥控器，然后这样没有，那样没有的。服务差：12点停电到4点，没有任何通知。问了说是要更换设备。。。。。。。。。。总之，我住过最差的饭店特别是服务！一打听，原来是当地交通局开的，怪不得！,"The hotel is old, the service is poor, the restaurant garbage!Pit the pit!I can't recommend it!Supplementary reviews September 30, 2006: Punman Behavior: Press the feet on the first floor of the ground, and tell me after pressing it for 30 minutes and an hour, and then add 38 to the potion.There are 30 more, but three minutes before the head massage!Hang people behavior: rent a local car back to Beijing, add me 300 yuan more!Poor service: Dining on the second floor of the restaurant was kicked out of the lobby. The reason was that there was a feast in the hall. The problem was that at that time, it was more than 7 o'clock. The entire hall was alone except for five or six waiters who discussed gossip!Finally, I rushed to a small box, and the TV said it was broken again, saying that there was no remote control, and then there was no such thing.Service poor: Power out of power to 4 o'clock without any notification.Asked, it was to change the device.EssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceIn short, I have lived in the worst restaurants, especially services!As soon as I asked, it turned out to be the local traffic bureau, no wonder!"
1,对宁夏大厦的的服务环境和设施都非常满意，有机会还会再入住的。也会推荐给朋友们！感觉很好！,"I am very satisfied with the service environment and facilities of Ningxia Building, and they will stay again with the opportunity.I will also recommend it to friends!feels good!"
0,"第一次去西宁，通过携程定的房间。我住的一个房间,卫生间的味道非常大,另外前台有个别服务员服务生硬,象是黑脸的包公,位置也较偏，总体来说与四星级的标准差距很大,性价比也不高。不知道携程怎么会把它定为银牌酒店，因为在西宁也没有住过其它酒店。","The first time I went to Xining to pass the Ctrip's room.A room I lived in, the bathroom tastes very great. In addition, there are individual waiters and waiters at the front desk hard, like black -faced Baogong, and the location is relatively biased. Generally speaking, the standard is very different from the four -star standard, and the cost performance is not high.I don't know how Ctrip will set it as a silver medal hotel, because I have never stayed in other hotels in Xining."
1,早餐不太理想，都看到小苍蝇叮在食物上，真不敢想象。其他还可以。,"Breakfast is not ideal. I saw Xiao Cangfun dingling on the food, so I couldn't imagine it.Others are okay."
1,早餐还可以，房间一般，不过隔音效果很好，虽然对则一条大马路，但是根本听不到什么嘲音,"Breakfast is okay, the room is average, but the sound insulation is very good. Although it is right, there is a big road, but you can't hear any ridicule at all"
1,到底是国际品牌酒店，服务很好。美中不足的是店门太小，不够气派。,"In the end, it is an international brand hotel, and the service is very good.The lack of beauty is that the store door is too small to be angry enough."
1,环境确实不错，不过普通标间实在是不能住，被子潮得像能拧出水，豪华标间就要好很多了。前台很朴素，相对于整个山庄的占地，显得太迷你了。门童小弟还是颇为勤快的。,"The environment is really good, but the ordinary standard is really unable to live. The quilt's tide is like to twist the water, and the luxury standard room is much better.The front desk is very simple, and it looks too mini compared to the entire area of the villa.Men's younger brother is quite diligent."
1,"环境很不错的酒店,在宜昌应该算是最好的酒店吧.房间有点旧但是还算过得去.","Hotels with good environment, should be regarded as the best hotel in Yichang. The room is a bit old but still too much."
1,酒店房间的隔音效果太差了.竟能听到隔壁房间关衣橱门的声音.宾馆反馈2008年3月17日：酒店已于2008年3月更名为星程上服假日酒店（虹桥），并按照星程酒店标准进行了新装修，对客房及服务进行了全面升级。我们将努力以全新的面貌，赢得您最大的满意。,"The sound insulation effect of the hotel room is too bad.

1,宾馆地段不错，可惜没有早餐提供。隔壁的那家饭店很有特色，名字忘了好像有吉祥两个字浴室下水很慢。总体评价中等。,"The hotel is good, but unfortunately there is no breakfast.The restaurant next door is very distinctive. The name has been forgotten that there is a good job in the water in the bathroom of auspicious words.Overall evaluation is medium."
0,"第一次到鞍山本来住五环,是五星的,没想到很差,完全没有五星的标准,房间又小又旧还很贵,还说新的VISTA系统不能上网，就改到假日去住,没想到一个四星的酒店也没有好到那去,服务差,房间还有蟑螂,地毯好脏,还有接结婚宴会，那是一个吵，真后悔住进去，原来这就是辽宁第三大城市，酒店的水平就是让消费者失望，希望快点有新的酒店进入鞍山。","The first time I arrived in Anshan, I lived in the Five Ring Road. It was five -star. I did not expect that it was very bad. There was no standard for five -star. The room was small, old, and expensive.I did not expect that a four -star hotel was not so good, the service was poor, there were cockroaches in the room, the carpet was so dirty, and the wedding banquet was a noisy. It really regretted it.The level of the hotel is to disappoint consumers, hoping to have a new hotel to enter Anshan."
1,"酒店地段不错,在市中心交通购物都很方便.整体感受服务很周到,刚进酒店前台员工便送来冰爽的冷饮说是赠送的.到房间后大堂副理打电话亲自询问入住情况,还给我介绍携程客人可以享受下午茶和洗衣服等服务,感觉很亲切,还赠送了水果.下次来厦门我还会选择这家酒店!","The hotel location is good, and the transportation and shopping in the city center is very convenient. The overall experience service is very thoughtful. As soon as the employees of the front desk of the hotel, I sent a cold cold drink that it was given away.I will introduce me to Ctrip guests to enjoy afternoon tea and laundering services. I feel very kind and give away fruits. Next time I come to Xiamen, I will choose this hotel!"

Later, after communicating with the three parties of the hotel, I said that it could be reduced to 200 yuan.I couldn't do it. Later, the front desk actually had to collect the long -distance fee I called to Ctrip, 12 yuan in 6 minutes. I expressed a strong protest, and the hotel stopped. The above process took a total of 1 hour.Money will go, but I still hope that CTRIP can give it a reasonable statement"
1,酒店最近房价浮动太大了，从以前携程价格的RMB591到现在已经要RMB965了，太贵了！,"The hotel's house prices have recently floated too much. From the previous RMB591 of Ctrip's price, RMB965 is now available, which is too expensive!"
0,差差差，太差了！不是一般的差，我希望以后携程不要再推荐这样的酒店给我！！！,The difference is too bad!It is not a general difference. I hope that Ctrip will not recommend such a hotel in the future!IntersectionIntersection
1,房间有些小了，但还算不错。很奇怪的是没有床头？？？早餐还不错交通挺方便的，到市区比较远，不过乌鲁木齐打车也方便，才20多块，开了半个多小时,"The room is a bit small, but it is pretty good.It is strange that there is no bedside?IntersectionIntersectionBreakfast is pretty good and convenient.

0,我可以负责任的告诉大家：这是我到目前为止住过的最差的所谓星级酒店！1.服务差：态度差到极点，前台服务员在办手续的时候好像你欠她几千万一样。要么爱理不理、要么言辞恶劣。一句请、麻烦、谢谢之类的词都没有。这些词好像是要顾客对他们说的。2.环境差：房间虽然是低价房，但是也不至于连街边几十块一天的招待所都不如吧？里面的家具都是非常破旧的，连喝的水都要自己烧。拖鞋是塑料的，叫服务员送双一次性的来还死活不愿意。3.卫生差：房间里卫生很不理想，厕所里有异味。洗澡用的隔帘几万年没洗过了，都长了霉斑。最恐怖的是，床单上居然还有血迹！,"I can tell everyone responsible: This is the worst so -called star hotel I have lived so far!1. Poor service: The attitude is extremely poor. When the front desk waiter runs the formalities, it seems that you owe her tens of millions.Either you ignore it or talk badly.There are no words such as please, trouble, and thank you.These words seem to be what customers say to them.2. Poor environment: Although the room is a low -priced house, it is not as good as the hospitality house of dozens of days on the street?The furniture inside is very worn, and even the water you drink must be burned by yourself.The slippers are plastic, and the waiter is not willing to send a double one -time one.3. Poor hygiene: The sanitation in the room is very unsatisfactory, and there is a odor in the toilet.The curtains for bathing have not been washed for tens of thousands of years, and they have grown mold.The most scary is that there are still blood on the sheets!"
1,我住的是豪华大床房，硬件不错，可惜床单上有细小毛发，不过服务台获知后马上就换了。自助餐很好。这是桐乡最好的酒店了。,"I live in a luxurious large bed room. The hardware is good. Unfortunately, there are small hair on the sheets, but the service desk is changed immediately after learning.The buffet is very good.This is the best hotel in Tongxiang."
1,"服务员的工作还算认真,有礼貌,说的是客房,总的印象还不错",The waiter's job is quite serious and polite. It is said to be a guest room.
0,总的来说非常不满意，明显是三星升为四星的酒店。588的房价，实在太不值。暖气不够热，温度调到32度，晚上睡觉还要盖两床被子，问他们再要一床，给我的答复是每间房间之配备这些，没有多余的被子。洗澡水是温的，差点没有洗出感冒。问要熨斗和烫板，竟然整个酒店只有一套，怎么也借不到。而且设施都已经很成旧，用的毛巾被子都是旧的，一眼就能看出来，实在算不上四星的标准。希望大家以后都不要预定这个酒店。,"Overall dissatisfaction, obviously Samsung's hotel is promoted to four -star hotels.588 house prices are too worthless.The heating is not hot enough, the temperature is adjusted to 32 degrees, and there are two beds in the night to sleep. Ask them to have another bed, and the answer to me is the equipment of each room. There is no extra quilt.The bath water is warm, and I almost did not wash a cold.Ask an iron and hot board, there is only one set of hotels in the whole hotel, and it can't be borrowed.And the facilities are already very old. The towel quilt is old. You can see at a glance. It is really the standard of four stars.I hope everyone will not book this hotel in the future."
0,你们怎搞了？怎么会推荐这种破酒店？还准五星？充其量三星。1月7日入住，700元大床房不能上网，连续换了三间房，半夜三更拆腾一小时…那个卫生间？唉…连招待所也不如，那个毛巾、浴巾，是不是抹布？电梯、走道充斥着隔壁如一坊火锅气味，说五星，其实就是写字楼里几层酒店。,"How did you do it?How can I recommend this kind of breaking hotel?Still five stars?At best Samsung.Checking on January 7, the 700 yuan large bed room could not access the Internet. I changed three rooms in a row. Three more times in the middle of the night for an hour ... That bathroom?Alas ... even the hospitality is not as good as that towels and bath towels, is it a rag?The elevator and aisle are filled with the smell of hot pot in Yifang next door.

1,在潮州可能也找不到更好的酒店了，感觉不如白玉兰。,"I may not find a better hotel in Chaozhou, it feels worse than Bai Magnolia."
1,"我是6月8号去的重庆,6号在携程定的酒店,去了以后开始看到旁边的房屋是有点失望,但是一到酒店门口就改观了..门童很热情的为我开车门拿行李,并且另一名服务员记下了出租车的车牌号,并给了我,很贴心很人性化的服务,这是我以前从来没遇见过的.下飞机在出租车上,的哥说那里交通不是很方便,我也很在意,但后面出门的时候都有服务员叫好出租车,这些问题都解决了,入住期间服务员很热情,房间布置也不错,房间里的小东西很齐全(虽说是有偿的),还有一个小细节,那天正好是端午节,我出去回来后发现房间多了一个小篮子,里面是两个粽子,很贴心...不过想给酒店提一点小意见,在大堂电梯外面摆放着一大个牌子,上面是酒店桑拿的广告,内容实在是太露骨,房间里的小卡片上面的内容也是这样的,让人感觉不太雅观,希望酒店能注意一点....并不是每个人在酒店里就是要做那什么的```不过总的说来,酒店还是很不错的```下次去重庆还住这里..","I went to Chongqing on June 8th.

It is very intimate and humane service. This is what I have never met before. Get off the plane on the taxi.

After I went back, I found that there was a small basket in the room. There were two dumplings inside.There is a large brand on the outside of the elevator with the advertisement of the hotel sauna. The content is too explicit. The content on the small card in the room is also the same.. Not everyone is doing that in the hotel."
1,不错，比武汉的好多了。由于只住了一晚，没有过多的感受。只是服务员态度稍微欠佳。,"Yes, much better than Wuhan.Because I only lived for one night, I didn't feel too much.It's just that the waiter has a slightly poor attitude."
1,酒店离兰桂坊和soho美食区比较近。酒店门口有直达巴士到铜锣湾。在半山高尚地段算是性价比不错的酒店了。,"The hotel is closer to Lan Kwai Fong and SOHO food areas.At the entrance of the hotel, there is a direct bus to Causeway Bay.It is a good cost -effective hotel in the noble section of Mid -Mountain."

I did not accept her suggestion, so I was sultry all night ..... I am very dissatisfied with this hotel"
1,第一次入住感觉不错。。只是晚上入睡前，居然有隔壁的人投诉，客房部就打电话来。。。我觉得这样就不对，本来房间是有隔音的，而且我跟朋友那时已经是打算睡觉了，只是因为隔壁房说听到很吵，就打电话来，这样搞得我们就没了睡意（当时已经是凌晨2点左右），如果我们已经睡了的话，这样不是给你们吵醒。。。酒店应该是通过实地调查才说吧，当时我跟朋友觉得屈死了。。希望在这方面有所改善。,"It feels good for the first time to check in.EssenceJust before falling asleep at night, there were people who complained next door, and the guest room department called.EssenceEssenceI think this is wrong.

1,"即便是江阴星级最高的酒店,但还是摆脱不了土的感觉,装修一般,早餐更是一般,对服务没有什么深刻的体会,相信如果有跨国酒店可以选择,应该会有进步.","Even if it is the highest -level hotel in Jiangyin, it still cannot get rid of the feeling of soil. The decoration is average. Breakfast is average. There is no deep experience in the service. I believe that if there are multinational hotels, you should have progress."
1,说是送果盘，到了房间根本没有，打电话问了几遍，开始还说马上送，后来有说下班了，第二天才给送来，而且水果都是整个的，没切。但总体还算物有所值。,"It was said that it was given a fruit plate. When I arrived at the room, I called a few times and asked a few times. I started to send it immediately. Later, I said that I was out of get off work. The next day was given to it, and the fruits were whole.But the general is worth it."
1,很不错的司星酒店，已经是为我们的贵宾客户第四次预订了，预定的行政豪华房，非常不错，只是房间略显小了些，但总体很好，服务业很好！值得推荐！,"The very good Sixing Hotel is already booked for our VIP customers for the fourth time. The scheduled administrative luxury room is very good, but the room is slightly smaller, but the overall is very good and the service industry is very good!Recommended!"
1,非常好的酒店，非常好的服务，我先生对酒店一向非常挑剔，只有这次他实在没话说！补充点评2008年8月6日：酒店餐厅正在装修，但不影响住宿。,"Very good hotel, very good service, my husband has always been very picky about the hotel. Only this time he has nothing to say!Supplementary comment on August 6, 2008: The hotel and restaurant are renovating, but not affecting accommodation."
1,酒店的环境还是挺不错的，一大片的高尔夫球场，绿色的草地让人心情很爽！旁边就是阳澄湖。房间还可以，略显陈旧！在酒店吃饭不是太方便，只有一个会所可以吃饭。隆重介绍高尔夫：练习场不太贵，30块30个球一个杆15快，大家可以试试，挺好玩的。总之度假首选！[酒店在大上海高尔夫球场里面]不是太好找！,"The environment of the hotel is still pretty good. A large golf course, the green grass is very cool!Next to Yangcheng Lake.The room is okay, slightly old!It is not too convenient to eat in the hotel, there is only one club to eat.Grand Introduction Golf: The exercise field is not too expensive, 30 pieces and 30 goals and one pole 15 fast. You can try it, which is fun.In short, vacation is the first choice![The hotel is in the Greater Shanghai Golf Stadium] It's not easy to find!"
1,服务还行，由于在市中心，周围环境有点闹，打车不方便，淋浴很好，水质及流量都比较满意，下次去还会考虑住这里。,"The service is okay.

1,我选择这里主要是看中游泳池，其他真不怎么样。隔音太差，早有人评价；早晨（7点左右）洗澡水是凉的。真的很犹豫，以后还住不住在这儿。,"I chose this is mainly to see the swimming pool. Others are not very good.The sound insulation is too poor, and some people have been evaluated; bathing water in the morning (around 7 o'clock) is cold.I really hesitated, and I couldn't live here in the future."
0,酒店离江门市中心很远，光打的士就要25元！酒店内的莱茵西餐厅服务非常差：喝的水有异味，点的三个菜有两个声称没有食材（鲜虾带子拼盘：女侍应说带子不新鲜不敢上；‘番茄炒牛肉’：女侍应说此牛肉没有，但生炒牛肉饭，牛扒却有），非要顾客改点其他较贵的菜式。什么此牛肉非彼牛肉，明摆着就是说谎！而且女侍应的态度绝对不敢恭维，取消时动作比我们还快，还要我们看脸色！客房：其中一张被子正面有破洞，翻过来还有破洞，并伴有污点！热水壶已坏，不能正常水沸断电。浴室一开始没有热水，工人整修一段时间后终于供应上，但水竟是锈黄色的，让我们放水好长时间才敢洗澡！又是一件让人心寒的事！晚上睡觉还有蚊子骚扰!为什么2005年开业的四星级酒店会有如此现象？？本来我们是要去休息一下的，没想到积了一肚子气！,"The hotel is far from the center of Jiangmen, and the taxi will be 25 yuan!The Rheinxi restaurant in the hotel is very poor: the water you drink is odor, and the three dishes are claimed to have no ingredients.The waitress said that the beef did not, but fried beef rice, but the steak was), and the customer had to change the other more expensive dishes.What this beef is not the other beef, it is clear that it is lying!Moreover, the attitude of the female waiter is definitely not dare to compliment.

1,即将新建无线网络，不管如何，吃的东西还是不错的，就是有点贵而且不能算在房费中，有点不划算,"The new wireless network is about to create a new wireless network, no matter what, what you eat is still good, but it is a bit expensive and not in the housing fee."

1,非常满意的一家宾馆，入住了五天让我感受不一样的服务。生日有礼，更要感谢中餐部的郑春妹女士，在得知本人身体不佳的情况下，特别送餐到客房很感动，下次到厦门一定还住在这里。谢谢了，谢谢你们的服务！,"A very satisfied hotel, staying in five days to make me feel different services.He is polite on his birthday, and also thanks to Ms. Zheng Chunmei of the Chinese Food Department. In the case of learning that she is not good, she is very moved to the guest room. The next time she arrives in Xiamen, she must still live here.Thank you, thank you for your service!"
0,服务不好！服务意识非常烂。订的双早房间，结果早餐只给了1张，吃早餐时被告知自己去找前台，态度生硬，好像客人都是骗子似的。结果早餐非常简陋……酒店的导游100元一天。在景点时总是催促你快点……，总是带你去一些需要你花费的地方，比如烧香（烧高香）、算命、请护身符、开光……，动辄几百元、甚至几千元……（但是本人坚决不买！）,"The service is not good!The service awareness is very bad.The booked double -morning room was given only one of the breakfast. When I ate breakfast, I was told to find the front desk.As a result, breakfast is very simple ...

1,1、酒店刚装修过，很好；2、酒店的科技含量较高：一个大的电视，可以当电视看，也可以做电脑显示屏。无线的键盘，坐在房上可以用电脑，第一次看见这样的酒店电视。另外，还在方便的宽带与电源，非常适合于商务人士。还有，坐式马桶也有科技含量。3、酒店位置很好。4、酒店很贵，特别是一楼的酒吧，非常贵。但是，商务人士一定得用的。早餐只有一份，不方便。5、客房的卧具很新，但是，不知是否在被整理的过程中，与地毯有接触？总感觉到表面上有一层浮毛毛，不知从那里粘上的，但里面没有。,"1. The hotel has just been renovated and it is very good; 2. The hotel's technological content is high: a large TV can be watched as a TV or a computer display.Wireless keyboard, you can use a computer in the room, and see such a hotel TV for the first time.In addition, it is also convenient to broadband and power, which is very suitable for business people.In addition, the sitting toilet also has a technological content.3. The hotel location is very good.4. The hotel is very expensive, especially the bar on the first floor, which is very expensive.However, business people must use it.There is only one breakfast, which is inconvenient.5.

I don't know if it sticks from there, but there is no inside."
0,房间空间比较小，环境比较吵。特别半夜被窗户外面的空调外机的声音吵醒（因为窗外一条巷子之隔，又是另一个建筑。所有空调外机都在一个走廊里，到了晚上开始轰鸣，回响。。。。）。走廊没有地毯，半夜走路的声音比较惹人烦。亲耳听见服务员和客人顶嘴，前台的服务员似乎总是说话带刺。很难评定的服务素质,"The room space is relatively small and the environment is noisy.Especially in the middle of the night, the sound of the air conditioner outside the window was awakened (because one alley outside the window and another building. All air -conditioning machines were in a corridor and began to roar at night ... echo ...).There is no carpet in the corridor, and the sound of walking in the middle of the night is more annoying.Hearing the waiters and guests with their own lips, the waiters at the front desk always seemed to be spying.It is difficult to evaluate the service quality"
1,1、房间内设施较齐全(有保险柜、电吹风、免费上网)、干净、性价比较高。2、周围日式餐馆较多。建议在标间里增设大床房型、方便单身旅客。,"1. The facilities in the room are relatively complete (there are safe, hair dryers, free Internet access), clean and cost -effective.2. There are many surrounding Japanese restaurants.It is recommended to add large bed room types in the standard room to facilitate single passengers."
1,"真正的四星级，不比有些地方的五星级差，早餐很丰富，晚上自助餐200，但是东西很好吃，特别是刺生巴东西很多（白豚刺生很好吃,但是感觉有点残酷）。边上青年路有很多小的粤菜馆，干净味道好价格便宜。","The real four -star level is not worse than the five -star grade in some places. Breakfast is rich. Buffets are 200 at night, but things are delicious, especially the stabbing raw babies (white dolphins are delicious, but it feels a bit cruel).There are many small Cantonese restaurants on the youth road.

1,10月12日入住的观海木楼，虫子没有，倒是有只癞蛤蟆在洗手间。被告知下午5点到晚上10点才有热水供应，可是到了那个时段，供应的只不过是稍微不冷的冷水...那天下午5点钟开始下雨直到凌晨，天气微凉，那个澡真的冲得很不爽。不过，服务人员的态度挺友善的，而且退房速度也比网评的迅速很多，大概也是由于淡季的缘故。还好蜈支洲很美，所以即便潜水的能见度不甚理想，即便晚上下雨无法看星星，整体感觉还不错。希望下次再来的时候晚上是个大晴天~,"Watching the sea building on October 12, there was no bug, but a toad was in the bathroom.It was told that there was hot water supply from 5 o'clock in the afternoon to 10 pm, but at that time, the supply was just a little cold water ... It started to rain at 5 pm that day until the early morning, the weather was slightly cool, and the bath was slightly cool.It's really uncomfortable.However, the attitude of the service staff is very friendly, and the speed of checking out is much faster than the online review. It is probably due to the off -season.Fortunately, Wuzhizhou is beautiful, so even if the visibility of diving is not ideal, even if it rains at night, it can't watch the stars, the overall feeling is not bad.I hope it will be a sunny day at night when I come again ~"
0,"首先我希望说的是请大家不要上当.我7月22号入住,订的是所谓的特色豪华房.给了我一个二楼的房间,但一进门吓一跳！离窗户不到一米（不夸张）是商业街的商铺后面，存放的全是垃圾一类的东西，我简直不敢相信这样的房间可以给客人住，最主要的是对面的人家可以轻而易举的到你房间来。于是立即要求换房，把房卡交给服务生让他帮忙拿到前台我们在3楼去等他。结果等了半个小时也没人来理我们！只好让朋友下去问，原来是来了一帮老外，他们只顾服务他们，把我们给忘了。给我们换了一个景观房，这个景欢其实就是一点点点点的雪山顶....要不是他们提醒，我根本不会注意到。可能就是等这半个小时，在楼上吹了风，当天晚上就发烧了。吃了药会发汗，一天让他们多换一次床单。开始没说什么，到第二天就来了一个什么客房部的主管来给我们脸色看。本来是当天要退房的，因为发烧所以不想动，就和他们说我们还要延住。但这帮没人道的家伙硬说没房了，要我们赶紧退房。后来还是携程去和他们谈了才给了我们一个一楼的“特色豪华房”。这个房间窗户也是对着旁边的商业街饭店的背面，房间里有气味潮气也重。到了晚上才知道上当了，原来商业街上的饭店全是有烧烤的，而且估计做饭全是烧煤或材什么的，晚上所有的烟全部进房间里。我就发着烧在这个破房间里熏了一晚上，第二天喉咙发炎！大家选择之前先看看我的经历吧！","First of all, I hope to say that everyone should not be fooled. I stayed in July 22nd. I ordered the so -called characteristic luxury room. I gave me a room on the second floor, but I was shocked as soon as I entered the door!Less than one meter away from the window (not exaggerated) is behind the shops of the commercial street. It is stained all the things such as garbage. I can't believe that such a room can live for guests.Come to your room.So he immediately asked to change the house, and gave the room card to the waiter for help him get the front desk. We waited for him on the third floor.As a result, no one came to ignore us after waiting for half an hour!I had to ask my friends to ask. It turned out that there was a group of foreigners. They only took care of them and forgot us.I changed us a landscape room. This scene is actually a little bit of snow mountain. If it wasn't for them to remind, I would not notice it at all.It may just wait for half an hour, blowing the wind upstairs, and a fever that night.After taking medicine, you will sweat, and let them change the sheets once a day.At first I said nothing, and the next day I came to see what the guest room department came to look at us.I was going to check out the same day. I didn't want to move because of the fever, so we told them that we still have to extend.But these unknown guys said that they had no house, and we asked us to check out quickly.Later, Ctrip went to talk to them before giving us a ""special luxury room"" on the first floor.The window of this room is also on the back of the commercial street restaurant next to it. The smell and tide in the room are heavy.It was only at night that I knew it was fooled. It turned out that the restaurants on the commercial street were barbecue, and it was estimated that the cooking was all coal -burning or material. All the cigarettes were entered the room at night.I fired in this broken room for a night, and my throat was inflamed the next day!Look at my experience before choosing!"
1,酒店的服务周到、细心。尤其是叫醒服务真的很到位，第二遍电话不通，居然还会来敲门，绝对叫醒，哈哈！,"The hotel's service is thoughtful and careful.Especially the wake -up service is really in place. The second time I can't make a phone call. I still come to knock on the door. Absolutely wake up, haha!"
1,地理位置较优越，房间内干净整洁，不能说很安静但出门在外凡事不能太叫真，隔音还是可以的，可以考虑无烟楼层的房间较安静，总台小姐的服务态度还是可以的，外出旅游住宿可以建议考虑此酒店，去王兴记吃虾肉馄饨或去三凤桥买酱排骨还是很方便的，谢谢！,"The geographical location is superior, and the room is clean and tidy. It can’t be said that it is very quiet, but you ca n’t be too true when you go out. The sound insulation is still okay. You can consider the quieter in the smoke -free floor.It is recommended to consider this hotel to go to Wang Xingji to eat shrimp and meat or go to Sanfengqiao to buy sauce pork ribs. Thank you!"
1,绝对是天津最好的五星级酒店，无愧于万豪的品牌！我住过两次，感觉都非常好。非常喜欢酒店配备的CD机，遥控窗帘，卫生间电动百页窗。早餐也非常好，品种多品质好。能在早餐吃到寿司的酒店不多，我喜欢这里的大堂，很有三亚万豪的风范！,"It is definitely the best five -star hotel in Tianjin, worthy of Marriott's brand!I lived twice and felt very good.I really like the CD machine, remote control curtains, and bathroom electric 100 -page windows.Breakfast is also very good, and the variety is more quality.There are not many hotels that can eat sushi at breakfast. I like the lobby here. It has the style of Sanya Marriott!"
0,交通很方便，离建国门地铁站步行5分钟，但是房间太小，感觉很老气的房子，进屋后觉得很压抑。房间内味道也不是很好。个人认为性价比差。,"The transportation is very convenient. It is 5 minutes walking from the Jianguo Metro Station, but the room is too small. The house with a very old -fashioned house feels very depressed after entering the house.The taste in the room is not very good.Personally think that cost performance is poor."
1,房间比较干净，卫生间太小，转身都费劲。地理位置一半，因在胡同里，不容易找到。服务一般。,"The room is relatively clean, the bathroom is too small, and the turn is strenuous.The geographical location is half, because it is not easy to find in the alley.The service is average."
1,"早餐份量很足,四个人吃两个人的份量都吃不完!!!","Breakfast is sufficient, and the weight of two people can't finish eating two people !!!"
0,7月4日入住该酒店，房间陈旧，一次性纸拖鞋是烂了个洞，卫生间的镜前灯竟然被挖掉了，线裸露在外面，看起来很糟糕，淋浴的莲蓬一碰就掉了，只能用一只手拿着洗，地板漏水...第二天一早吃早餐，等了很久，酒店的早餐豆浆没有了，因为早餐竟然是外卖的，这是我第一次听说。原本跟前台讲好的，推迟到一点退房，结果等服务员来查房，然后到前台办手续只晚了十分钟，竟然要加收半天的房费，而且前台的说法是服务员问了说没有人要退房，是房客的问题，差点晕倒，最后解决的方法是加收了三分之一的房费，不知道这间酒店是不是在房费的结算上有很高的随意性，因为当时急着外出办事，没有继续理论。总之，强烈呼吁大家不要入住这间所谓的国际酒店，真的很糟糕！宾馆反馈2008年7月25日：尊敬的客户：您好！看了您对该酒店的点评，我们管理人员的心久久不能平静，首先我们要感谢您的意见，所谓酒店的成长也是通过听取客户的感受和意见扬长弊短的，但是酒店的操作是有着正规的程序，对每位入住我酒店的客人都很重视,"Check in the hotel on July 4th. The room is old. The disposable paper slippers are rotten. The front lights of the bathroom mirror are dug out. The lines are exposed to the outside., I can only use one hand to wash, the floor is leaking ... I ate breakfast early the next morning. After waiting for a long time, the hotel's breakfast soy milk was gone because the breakfast turned out to be takeaway. This is the first time I heard.Originally talked to the front desk, postponed a little check -up, and as a result, the waiter came to check the house, and then went to the front desk for the front desk for only ten minutes late. It would take a half -day room fee, and the front descendant said that the waiter asked that the waiter asked and saidNo one wants to check out. It is a problem with the tenant. I almost fainted. The final solution was to charge one -third of the room fee. I don’t know if this hotel has a high casualness in the settlement of the house fee.Because at that time, he was in a hurry to go out and did not continue theory.In short, it is really bad to call on everyone not to stay in this so -called international hotel!Hotel feedback on July 25, 2008: Dear customer: Hello!After reading your reviews of the hotel, our managers cannot be calm for a long time. First of all, we have to thank your opinions.The procedure is attached great importance to the guests who stay in my hotel"
1,地理位置不错！前台及门卫的服务也蛮到位。但是在房间安排方面觉得有点欠妥，我订了两间高级房，一样的价格，但不一样的房型，一件的漱洗间非常小，而且没有阳台，另一间的漱洗间却是这间的两倍，而且有阳台！另外，在中餐厅结帐时，竟然让我重复签了三次单，说与我在前台留的名字不一样？！真是让人很不爽。最后一件不爽的事，在携程网上订时，每房均送水果和小熊玩具，结果到了晚上也没人送，打电话一问，说是送给会员的！当然最终还是送了，但是如果是送给会员的，就不应该在携程上标出。所以这一条也不是太开心！,"Good geographical location!The service of the front desk and the gatekeeper is also quite in place.However, it feels a bit in the room arrangement. I booked two high -end houses, the same price, but different room types, one of the rushing rooms is very small, and there is no balcony.This room is twice, and there is a balcony!In addition, when I checked out in the Chinese restaurant, I made me repeatedly signed three orders, saying that it was different from my name left in the front desk?IntersectionIt's really upset.The last unhappy thing was to send fruits and bear toys on each room when I booked on the Internet. As a result, no one was delivered at night. I called and said that it was for members!Of course, it was finally delivered, but if it was given to a member, it should not be marked on Ctrip.So this one is not too happy!"
1,房间整体感觉除了装修不够新潮外，其他还是可以的。我住的是大床房，如果房间浴室能做成玻璃的感觉应该会更好。酒店地理位置是绝佳的，我们从广州坐车到长安，下车后过个马路就是长安酒店了，超方便。酒店周围饮食店、百佳超市都有。特别推荐大家去尝一尝明红川菜，十一年前我在长安生活时就有明红川菜馆，十一年后去竟然还在！而且味道依然是那么好，菜式做得比以前也精致多了，呵呵……携程需要改善的地方是应该努力跟酒店洽谈，每个房间都应送双份早餐，一份早餐造成客人诸多不便。说实话，两人入住酒店，早餐不去吃又觉得浪费，去吃吧，另一份早餐要额外掏五十多块，倒不是说价格贵，而是觉得早餐质量不值那钱，呵呵……,"The overall room feels that in addition to the non -renovation tide, others are still okay.I live in a large bed room. If the room bathroom can make glass, it should be better.The geographical location of the hotel is excellent. We take a car from Guangzhou to Changan. After getting off the bus, we are the Changan Hotel, which is super convenient.The restaurants around the hotel are all available.I especially recommend everyone to taste Minghongchuan cuisine. I lived in Changan during the life of 11 years ago. I was still there after 11 years!And the taste is still so good, the dishes are much more exquisite than before, haha ... The place where Ctrip needs to improve is that you should work hard to negotiate with the hotel. Each room should be given double breakfast.EssenceTo be honest, the two are in the hotel, and they feel wasteful when they do n’t eat breakfast. Let ’s eat it. Another breakfast should be extracted more than 50 pieces.Mowing"
1,第一次入住，感觉很好，不吐不快，一来表扬酒店，二来为他人做一介绍。本次入住主要感觉的特点如下：1、服务较好；2、大床房的床真的很大，很舒服3、有健身房、游泳池和桑拿，住客免费4、西餐厅个别菜肴和点心味道极佳（名字搞忘了）,"For the first time, I felt very good. I did n’t vomit. On the one hand, I praised the hotel, and I introduced it for others.The characteristics of the main feeling of this check -in this time are as follows: 1. The service is better; 2. The bed in the large bed room is really large, very comfortable 3. There are gym, swimming pools and sauna, free residents.Excellent (forgotten the name)"
0,"春节去住了一晚,进门就像到了一个大市场,晚上快12:00了,竟然还人声鼎沸,感觉很闹.房间进去后感觉还可以,不过卫生间很差,淋浴没有门,撒了一屋的水.整体感觉就是3星标准.第2天换去香格里拉了.以后也不会再去!","I stayed for one night during the Spring Festival. I entered the door like a large market. It was almost 12:00 in the evening. It was still full of people. It felt very noisy. After the room entered, I felt okay, but the bathroom was poor, the shower had no door, and there was no door.The water of a house. The overall feeling is the 3 -star standard. On the second day, I will go to Shangri -La. I won't go again in the future!"
1,服务很好!干净舒适~招待也很热心~!餐饮也很不错~!第一次住酒店~感觉很好!~下次还会来的~!,The service is very good! Clean and comfortable ~ The entertainment is also very enthusiastic ~! Catering is also very good ~! The first time I live in the hotel ~ It feels good! ~ I will come next time ~!
1,如去恐龙园的话，推荐的肯定是这家酒店了，环境不错的，加上有高尔夫球场，绿化是不用说的了。入住的是豪华大床房，蛮好的，气派。服务员的态度也是可以。只是早餐差了些。过两年等小朋友长大些，还会再去的。,"If you go to the dinosaur garden, you must recommend this hotel. The environment is good. In addition, there is a golf course, so greening is needless to say.It is a luxurious large bed room, which is pretty good and elegant.The attitude of the waiter is also possible.It's just that breakfast is worse.After two years, when children grow up, they will go again."
1,在开发区，地理位置不错，很好找。比起市区的五星级酒店硬件上稍差，但还算干净舒适，考虑到价格比市区便宜，性价比还可以啦。旁边就有购物中心和餐饮街，购物、吃饭都很方便。,"In the development zone, the geographical location is good, and it is easy to find.Compared with the five -star hotels in the urban area, it is slightly worse, but it is still clean and comfortable. Considering that the price is cheaper than the urban area, the price / performance ratio is okay.There are shopping malls and catering streets next to it. Shopping and eating are very convenient."
1,对该酒店总体感觉良好，以后再到临安还可以入住该酒店。建议酒店在安排两间以上客人房间时，南北朝向搭配好，就更好了。,"I feel good for the hotel, and I can stay in the hotel in Lin'an in the future.It is recommended that when the hotel is arranged for more than two guests' rooms, it is better to match the north and south dynasties."
1,"188的大床房，房间的性价比非常高，很不错，我住了一天之后，又连续多住了2天。2楼的大床房比8楼的格调好很多，下次来，还是会住2楼的。。唯一的就是交通不是很好，虽然打车也方便，17快到人民广场。总得来说，很好，很满意，前台服务员非常好，服务好！！！！！！！！！1宾馆反馈2008年5月29日：谢谢您对我们酒店的肯定,我们会竭诚提供更好的服务期待着您的下次光临!","In the large bed room in 188, the room was very cost -effective and very good. After I lived for a day, I lived for another 2 consecutive days.The big bed room on the second floor is much better than the 8th floor. Next time, I will still live on the second floor.EssenceThe only thing is that the transportation is not very good, although it is convenient to take a taxi, and go to People's Square at 17.All in all, very good, very satisfied, the front desk waiter is very good and the service is good!IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersection1 Hotel feedback on May 29, 2008: Thank you for your affirmation of our hotel.

1,在中山陵里，很安静，晚上睡觉的时候一点声音都没有，早餐还可以，服务也还可以,"In the Zhongshan Mausoleum, it is very quiet. There is no sound at all when I go to bed at night. Breakfast is okay, the service is okay"
1,房间比较旧，骚扰电话太多，一个接一个，受不了补充点评2008年6月27日：忘了说，大床房是用两张小床拼的，不平，千万别住,"The room is relatively old, and there are too many harassment calls. One after another, I can't stand the replenishment comment on June 27, 2008: Forget it, the big bed room is fighting with two small beds."
1,"第一次去郑州就入住的宾馆.去的时候打表被出租车司机黑了,后来知道了,到郑州打车可以讲价的,机场到中州皇冠90元足够了,如果是坎价高手估计80也能下来吧.有免费的游泳池很不错,但游泳池不太好找,而且去的路上要小心台阶,本人就不小心拌倒了,因为没有明示,这点酒店做的不到位.","The first time I went to Zhengzhou to stay in the hotel. When I went, the watch was hacked by a taxi driver. Later, I learned that it was enough to get a bargain at Zhengzhou.Can you come down. There is a free swimming pool very good, but the swimming pool is not easy to find, and if you go to the road, you must be careful of the steps. I accidentally down, because there is no explicit, this hotel is not in place."
1,周边交通方便，房价偏高，宾馆提供的游泳，健身是个体承包的，大厅不够气派，感觉整体和四星级搭配不上。,"The surrounding transportation is convenient, the house prices are high, and the swimming provided by the hotel is an individual contracted. The hall is not enough to facilitate the style. It feels that the overall is not matched with the four -star."
1,早餐不错，特别是当地的风味很好吃。但是二楼的中餐厅在春节期间的菜式品种太少。,"Breakfast is good, especially the local flavor is delicious.But the Chinese restaurants on the second floor are too small during the Spring Festival."
0,对该酒店非常不满意，最后还逼得吵了一通。入住后预订了3天住宿，最后一天，我一大早5点起来赶飞机，得知6点多以后才有早饭，所以就主动把他们早给我的餐券还给他们了，但是账单打印出来后，发现最后一天的早餐钱居然还是算在里面，觉得非常奇怪。答复我非常简单，就是不能退！问原因，说电脑系统就是这样设计的，当天开始的时候，就把早餐费用和房费一起算进去了，因此即使没有消费也不能退，如果客人要投诉尽管投诉！出差10年，从来没有遇到这样服务差的酒店，野蛮对待顾客，乱收费，之前没有任何说明，餐券上也没有任何说明，憋了一肚子气！房间上网费用很贵，一个小时18元，这还不算，上不了网，怀疑是网线的问题，请总台重新给一根网线，说必须自己去总台拿。回到宾馆，把衣服、裤子、鞋子都已经换了，让客人这样去总台合适吗，是四星级宾馆的服务吗？和他们说了，来了几个服务员，看了很久，把我的电脑莫名其妙不经过我同意就重启，最后说还是要我自己下去拿网线，我晕倒！下面的几个商场，说是可以结到房费里面去，但是实际呢，买地图、买饼干的地方，都告诉我小费用，必须用现金交易，一气之下，啥也没有买。卖东西的自己只顾玩游戏，非让我自己找商品。。。以后我坚决不住这个大官员酒店。出来后，出租车司机说，这个酒店的服务、管理北京有名的差。,"I was very dissatisfied with the hotel, and finally made a noise.After check -in for 3 days, I stayed for 3 days. On the last day, I got up at 5 in the morning to catch the plane. I learned that there was breakfast after more than 6 o'clock, so I took the initiative to return the coupons they gave me early, but the bill was printedAfter coming out, I found that the last day's breakfast money was still inside, and it was very strange.I am very simple to answer, but I can't retreat!Ask the reason, saying that this is how the computer system is designed. At the beginning of the day, the breakfast fee and room fee were calculated together, so even if there was no consumption, they could not be refunded.For 10 years on a business trip, I have never encountered a hotel that has been poorly served. It treats customers brutally and charges charges. There was no explanation before, and there was no explanation on the meal coupon.The cost of Internet access to the room is very expensive. It is 18 yuan an hour. This is not counted. I ca n’t get on the Internet. I suspect that it is a problem with the network cable. Please ask the main station to re -give a network cable and say that you must go to the main station yourself.Back to the hotel, I have changed their clothes, pants, and shoes. Is it appropriate to let the guests go to the main station like this? Is it the service of the four -star hotel?Tell them, I have come here a few waiters, watch it for a long time, and restart my computer inexplicably without my consent. Finally, I still want me to go down to get the network cable. I faint!The following shopping malls are said to be able to get in the room fee, but in fact, the place where the map and biscuits are used to tell me a small fee that you must trade with cash.Those who sell things only take care of the game, let me find a product myself.EssenceEssenceIn the future, I can't help this big official hotel.After coming out, the taxi driver said that the hotel's service and management of Beijing were famous."
1,这次是第二次住这里了，同上次一样，第二天早上还是要早早的退房，房间依然是不错的，但由于这次是从平顶山的佳田国际过来，就感觉有些简陋了。唯一不太好的就是淋浴的喷头出水不算顺畅，建议下次装修时改换喷头种类，总之在许昌这个酒店算是最好的了。,"This time I lived here for the second time. As last time, I still had to check out early the next morning. The room was still good, but because this time I came from Jiatian International in Pingdingshan, it felt a little humble.The only thing that is not very good is that the spray head of the shower is not smooth. It is recommended to change the type of nozzle at the next decoration. In short, it is the best in Xuchang's hotel."
1,家庭间不错，空间大，干净清洁，但浴室空间小了点。整体来说，是很好的一家酒店。酒店靠近立交桥，怕吵的人，可要挑好位置的房间。,"The family is good, the space is large, clean and clean, but the bathroom space is a little smaller.Overall, it is a good hotel.The hotel is close to the Lijiao Bridge. People who are afraid of noisy can choose the room where the position is good."
0,总体来看，酒店价高，设施差，不值得推荐。价格338元标准间，在同类房价中偏高。设施差有以下几点：整个房间没有一张纸，一支笔。卫生间没有浴帘，洗澡后满地是水，地面打滑，水龙头出水很小。早餐7点才有，包双早等于空话一句。免费班车，只送2号航站楼，在强烈要求下才送到3号航站楼，如有误机还不负责，除非提前三个小时送，不合情理。,"Generally speaking, the price of hotels is high, facilities are poor, and they are not recommended.The price of 338 yuan standard room is high in similar house prices.The facilities are poor: there is no piece of paper, a pen in the entire room.There is no shower curtain in the bathroom. After bathing, it is full of water, slipping the ground, and the water faucet is small.Breakfast is only available at 7 o'clock.Free shuttle bus, only send Terminal 2, and send it to Terminal 3 at the time of the Terminal 2. If there is a mistake, it is not responsible, unless it is delivered for three hours in advance, it is not reasonable."
1,"阳光酒店比我想象中要好的多,特别是它的泳池的位置,真有点和周围岛湖自成一景的感觉,人在其中,举目远眺,人和自然景色的融合的恰如其分.酒店的早餐也很丰盛,前台很忙,但还是有问必答.和朋友入住的是行政单间,室内的装饰略显陈旧,客房服务也有点不足,免费的水果送来时正值客人午睡之时,应该是客人一进门送比较及时.这点还需要改进.总的来说,如果能入住到大湖景房的话,个人感觉性价比还是蛮高的.有机会还是会入住的.","Sunshine Hotel is much better than I think, especially the location of its swimming pool. It really feels like the surrounding island and lakes. People are in it, looking far away, and the integration of people and natural scenery is appropriate. Hotel’s hotel’sBreakfast is also very rich, the front desk is very busy, but there are still questions to answer. The administrative single room with friends is slightly old, and the room service is a bit insufficient. When the free fruit is delivered, the guest is at a time when the guest is nap.It should be that the guests enter the door and send it in time. This needs to be improved. In general, if you can stay in the Great Lake Scenic Fang, personal cost -effectiveness is still quite high. If you have the opportunity, you will stay."
1,不错的酒店，本人经常入住，对周边及酒店环境都很熟悉。,"Good hotels, I often move in, and I am familiar with the surrounding and hotel environment."
0,"强烈建议CTRIP取消这个酒店的预定.本人5月2X日入住,当天晚上还没8点,就不断的有女人敲门,相信大家知道""她""是做什么的.这些也就算了,为","It is strongly recommended that CTRIP cancel the prediction of this hotel. I stay in May 2x on May 2x. There was no 8 o'clock that night, and a woman continued to knock on the door. I believe everyone knows what she does."
1,花园环境还好，早餐也不错。晚饭时间车位很紧张，只能停篮球场。卫生间设施比较陈旧，洗手盆有裂痕。“请带我回家”的红色小卡片上没有印任何地址或地图，奇怪。房间里有酒店内部报赠阅，时间早的是第19期，晚的那份却是第2期，有点莫名。,"The garden environment is okay, and breakfast is also good.The parking spaces are very tight and can only stop the basketball court.The bathroom facilities are relatively old, with cracks in the wash basin.There is no address or map on the red card ""Please take me home"", strange.There is a hotel in the room to report it. The 19th period was early, but the late part was the second issue, which was a bit inexplicable."
1,总体还是比较满意。房间布置比较别致，有液晶电视和数字电视，卫生间也比较干净。网络速度比较快。,"Overall is relatively satisfactory.The room layout is relatively unique, with LCD TVs and digital TVs, and the bathroom is relatively clean.The network speed is faster."
1,我们这次圣诞新年假期原计划是在博鳌看宾斯基住一周的，结果一住就十天了。凯宾斯基饭店的环境是放松和度假的好地方，一百一十多幢的别墅掩映在亚热带的树林景色和河边当中，简花是见花草树林不见人，我们白天开车在饭店内怎么兜风，也没遇到几个人，等到晚上从别墅中透出来的灯光，才知道这里基本还有这么多地度假的人。从我们住的是独享单间，6天住港式风格的，4天住得是韩式风格的。整幢别墅只有我们两公婆，里面听宽敞的，饭店挺豪气的，或许呼应德国的品牌饭店吧，大冰箱、滚筒洗衣机是西门子，灯开关插座是西门子的，电熨斗是飞利浦的，抽油烟机是意大利的，多士炉是什么牌子忘了。或许想我们这样，带着面包面条橄榄油吞拿鱼罐头烟肉番茄酱在厨房开餐的人不多，所以，发现，多士炉是没人用过，全新的;洗衣机是全新没人用过的，让我这个小主妇开心的不亦乐乎！说说存在的问题吧。闲聊时得知，当年饭店为了赶工程，室内装修都出现了不同程度的质量问题，比如，装修的手工粗劣，正是因为连续住进的两套别墅的浴缸都严重渗水，才在饭店内挪了三次窝。饭店的早餐管理我认为有不妥。第一次登记入住是从28日开始到1月4日的，早餐券每天两张共14张一模一样的，开始两天没有去吃早餐，到了1号去餐厅看看，是自助早餐，虽然品种只有十来二十种，中西式都有，还好，不错，我还可以打包回去给老公。结果到了三号，我去了一看，啥都没有，只有经理和几个服务员在那，经理招呼我坐下后，已不见了。服务员收取了我两张早餐券，给我端上了一份中式早餐，一碗白粥，一小份炒面，一个包子一个馒头，完事。我无从下口，让服务员给我拿了一碗酸奶泡麦片，喝了，然后，让服务员打包两杯酸奶回去，结果服务员让我签单，我明白了，今天的免费早餐变了，只有一份中式的，我要的酸奶和麦片要另外付费，我一看账单，愣住了，3杯酸奶加一小碗麦片共76块人民币。4号续住的时候，我都懒得去领早餐券了，因为老公说，国务院三天假期过了，我们不能度假了。既然饭店是真正休闲度假的地方，我想饭店应该把客人住店的每一天都视之为假日，我真的承受不了一天冷一天热的服务概念。既然饭店要做远离尘嚣、远离喧闹的休闲度假区，我接受休闲度假区天天一样的房价，但必须给我天天一样的休闲度假的服务。对吧？幸好，我们带足够了厨房粮草，早餐、午餐我在厨房里忙乎，晚上到金海岸西餐厅晚餐，也优哉游哉的度过了一个搏鳌凯宾斯基假期。,"Our Christmas and New Year holiday originally planned to see Bentki live in Boao for a week, but it was ten days after living.The environment of the Kobezki Hotel is a good place to relax and vacation. More than one hundred villas are hidden in the landscape and river of the subtropical woods. Jane flowers are not seen in the flowers and plants. How can we drive in the hotel during the day?I didn't meet a few people. When the lights came out of the villa at night, I knew that there were basically many people who had so many vacations here.From we live in a single room, we live in Hong Kong style for 6 days, and live in Korean style for 4 days.The whole villa is only our two in -laws. The spacious ones inside, the restaurant is very arrogant. Perhaps it echoes the German brand restaurant. The large refrigerator and the drum washing machine are Siemens. The light switch socket is Siemens.It is Italy, what brand of Du Shi furnace has forgotten.Maybe we think of us, and there are not many people with bread noodles olive oil swallowing fish, canned tobacco, cigarette meat and meat tomato sauce in the kitchen. Therefore, I found that no one has used the polyshi furnace, and the washing machine is brand new.I have been happy to make my little housewife happy!Talk about existing problems.I learned during the chat that in order to catch up the project, the restaurant had different degrees of quality problems in the interior decoration. For example, the decoration was too bad, because the bathtubs of the two villas that were continuously entered were severely exuded in the restaurant.Three times.Breakfast management in the hotel is inappropriate.The first registered check -in was from the 28th to January 4th. The breakfast coupons were the same for two pieces a day. I did not go to breakfast for two days. I went to the restaurant on the 1st.There are only ten or twenty types, both Chinese and Western styles. Fortunately, yes, I can also package it back to my husband.As a result, I went to the third, and I went to see anything. There was nothing. Only the manager and a few waiters were there. The manager greeted me to sit down.The waiter received two breakfast vouchers, and gave me a Chinese -style breakfast, a bowl of white porridge, a small stir -fried noodles, a bun and a steamed bun, finished.I couldn't get my mouth, let the waiter take me a bowl of yogurt oatmeal, drink it, and then let the waiter pack two cups of yogurt back. As a result, the waiter asked me to sign the bill. I understand that today's free breakfast has changed, there is only one copy, there is only one copy, there is only one copy, there is only one copy.In Chinese, the yogurt and oatmeal I want to pay separately. When I looked at the bill, I stunned. 3 cups of yogurt and a small bowl of oatmeal a total of 76 yuan.When I renewed on the 4th, I was too lazy to get a breakout coupon, because my husband said that the State Council had three days of vacation, and we could not take a vacation.Since the restaurant is a real place for leisure vacations, I think the hotel should regard the guests' living in the shop every day as a holiday. I really can't bear the concept of service that is cold and one day.Since the restaurant is going to be a leisure resort that is far away from the hustle and bustle, I accept the same house prices of the leisure resort every day, but I must give me a casual vacation service every day.Right?Fortunately, we brought enough food and grass in the kitchen. I was busy with breakfast and lunch in the kitchen. I went to the Golden Coast West Restaurant for dinner at night."
1,已经多次选择入住该酒店了，总体来说还是不错的。这回可能是因为酒店包了会议，房间有些紧张，后来给升级成了大床（水床）房。酒店早餐没什么新异与前几次类似。,"I have chosen to stay at the hotel many times, and it is generally good.This time it may be because the hotel has packed the meeting. The room was a little tense, and later it was upgraded to a large bed (water bed) room.The hotel breakfast is not new to the previous several times."
1,地理位置比较便捷，逛街、旅游、办事都比较方便。老的宾馆新装修改的，房间内的设施简洁、干净，但宾馆整体建筑设施比较陈旧。,"The geographical location is relatively convenient, and shopping, travel, and work are more convenient.The old hotel is newly decorated and modified. The facilities in the room are simple and clean, but the overall building facilities of the hotel are relatively old."
0,"广大携程会员请注意:此酒店旁边在造地铁之类的施工,有噪音和灰尘.等完工还有一段日期.出门叫出租车也不方便.入住请考虑这些方面因素.客房里的茶叶不是免费的,是要收钱啦,也要注意.","The majority of Ctrip members, please note: there are noise and dust next to the construction of subway next to this hotel. There is still a date when it is completed. It is not convenient to go out for taxis. Please consider these factors in check -in.It is to collect money, and pay attention."
0,"太差啦,不知道是怎么评的4星.结帐时还非说有房间点了歌,每首2圆,懒得跟他废话就多掏了4块钱.","It's too bad. I don't know how to comment. I still say that there is a room to sing a song at the checkout. Each one is 2 rounds, and I bother to pay 4 yuan more for him."

0,很一般的酒店。标的3星级，房间面积到是很大，电视机也不错，是液晶的，床也还行。可是，以下几点却让人大跌眼镜：1、写字台前没有椅子可坐，放了个长板凳，让人大跌眼镜！！好像连招待所都不如。2、房间没有咖啡，每天要跟服务员要才给，有次下楼经过服务间，听到服务员在聊天说，某某房间的客人又要咖啡！！！，好像客人就不该跟她们要似的。袋装咖啡应该是每个星级酒店必为客人每天免费准备的。3、房间迷你吧的饮料和小吃消费后，没有服务员给你补充。4、酒店给人的感觉是没有任何服务的酒店。除了每天打扫一次房间外，没有任何房间服务。中午客人回房间休息后，下午出去，晚上回来，发现原来是什么样还是什么样，床和卫生间没有整理，没有开夜床的服务。房间窗户、窗帘保持原样。5、酒店早餐太差，除了能吃口稀饭外，其他基本没东西可吃的。6、天天晚上10点多有骚扰电话打搅。7、房间牙具太差，住了3个晚上，前2个晚上的牙具都是透明塑料袋装的那种，挤不出牙膏来，都是干锅巴，重送过来的也是一样，只能干嗽嗽口了。第3个晚上是那种纸包的牙具，要好多了，至少能挤出牙膏来。,"Very ordinary hotel.The 3 -star of the target, the room area is very large, the TV is also good, it is LCD, and the bed is okay.However, the following points are surprising: 1. There are no chairs to sit in front of the writing table. A long bench is placed, which is surprising!IntersectionIt seems that even the guest house is not as good.2. There is no coffee in the room. I have to give it to the waiter every day. Once I went downstairs through the service room, I heard the waiter chatting and said that the guests in a certain room wanted coffee again!IntersectionIntersectionIt seems that guests should not be like them.Bag coffee should be prepared for guests every day for each star -rated hotel.3. After the room mini, the drink and snack consumption, no waiters will add it to you.4. The hotel feels that there is no service hotel.There is no room service except to clean the room once a day.After the guest returned to the room to rest at noon, I went out in the afternoon and came back in the evening. I found what it was still like. The bed and the bathroom did not organize and did not have the service of the night bed.The room window and curtains are kept like.5. The hotel breakfast is too bad. Except for eating porridge, there are basically nothing to eat.6. During the night at 10 o'clock in the evening, there are more harassment calls.7. The room's teeth are too bad. I lived for 3 nights. The teeth of the first two nights were loaded with transparent plastic bags. Can't squeeze toothpaste. They are all dry pots.Cough.The third night is the kind of paper bag, which is much better, at least it can squeeze out toothpaste."
1,"位置非常接近浦展;然是二面路,但相,不有太多。服素一般,只是早餐相差,只有:吃或不吃","The location is very close to Puzhan; but it is a two -sided road, but the phase is not too much.The serving vegetarian is average, but the breakfast is different, only: eat or not eat"
1,环境是济南最好的。楼后的花园很漂亮。房间设施只能算是一般，不大符合省委招待所的要求。交通比较方便，出门不远就是高架桥，不过就是门口经常堵车。,"The environment is the best in Jinan.The garden behind the building is beautiful.The room facilities can only be regarded as average, and they are not in line with the requirements of the provincial party committee's hospitality.The transportation is more convenient. Not far away is the viaduct, but the door is often traffic jam."
1,"非常舒心的酒店,不大,很安静,很温馨,每间房的阳台上都有盛开的鲜花,房间里有很多可供浏览的杂志,还有中英文的小说.当街的房间关上窗户没有噪音,窗户的开法非常奇怪.淋浴房有些渗水,但水够大够冲,很舒服.酒店有些经营方式思路很特别,很人性,许多五星酒店也没有做到.推荐泰逸,也推荐金沙博物馆,值得一看,红杏酒楼味道不错,有不辣的,值得一去..宾馆反馈2008年5月6日：感谢点评，特别送一首小诗给您，祝异乡的您泰逸安康！谢谢您与泰逸邂逅在美丽的人生之旅，纵然相隔万水千山，愿在蓦然回首的刹那，您会记得那张真诚而温馨的笑脸，浓浓的祝福伴您海角天边，无际蔓延，还有泰逸酒店窗台上那娇艳的杜鹃，曾为您尽情绽颜……岁月如歌，心系泰逸。","A very comfortable hotel, not big, quiet, very warm, there are blooming flowers on the balcony of each room, there are many magazines for browsing in the room, as well as Chinese and English novels.The opening method of the window is very strange.

0,差！再不会住了第一天到，晚上给个吹风机说最后一个了，结果用的时候发现是坏的，害我湿着头发睡觉第二天早上，地板封边一条莫名其妙跷起，好像老化了，晚上见完客户回去，发现整栋宾馆停电了，还不知道来电时间……第三天早上去结账，靠，说是发票开不了，打不出来了……什么破宾馆。一次性用品都差的要死，很多老旧了，幸好我自带了很多物品，否则要重新去超市买了有生以来住过最搞笑而糟糕的酒店,"Difference!I wo n’t live on the first day, and I will tell the last one at night. As a result, I found that it was bad when I used it. It hurts me to wet my hair and sleep the next morning.After seeing the client back at night, I found that the entire hotel was out of power. I didn't know the call time ... I went to check out on the morning of the third day.The one -time supplies are poor. Many old -fashioned.

1,"国际酒店一向都是很好,住过很多四星酒店,我一直最满意的.房价是很合理,除了牙刷洗发露,肥皂品质很好,房间视野很好,装饰和色调非常清爽,在工作忙碌中回到这家酒店的房间就感觉很舒服.最近酒店换了新款式的牙刷感觉不是很好.50楼的旋转餐厅也是观景很好,四楼酒吧有卖雪茄,二楼西餐有正中乳酪,免费停车.所有服务人员都很专业而且态度很好.我外国人长住在中国已有10年了,除了牙刷,感觉是最好的酒店.","International hotels have always been very good. I have lived in many four -star hotels. I have always been most satisfied. House prices are very reasonable. In additionIt feels very comfortable to return to this hotel's room in the busy room.

All service staff are very professional and have a good attitude. I have been living in China for 10 years. I feel that it is the best hotel except toothbrushes."
1,晚上11点左右入住，发现卫生间水龙头有问题，通知前台以后半小时都没有人来修理，服务效率不高,Check in around 11 pm and find that there is a problem with the faucet of the bathroom. No one came to repair the front desk after notifying the front desk. The service efficiency is not high
0,价格便宜的好像是1号楼，太差，空调无暖气，无宽带，千万不要住。可以推荐汽车站对面交通局开的宾馆，有宽带。也方便。龙岩象个县级市，不好打的士。宾馆反馈2008年3月12日：1号楼中央空调，含暖气，免费宽带上网。宾馆免费提供代客联系出租车业务。,"It seems that the price is Building 1, which is too bad. There is no heating in the air conditioner, no broadband, and never live.You can recommend a hotel opened by the traffic bureau opposite the bus station, with broadband.It is also convenient.Longyan is like a county -level city.Hotel feedback on March 12, 2008: Building 1 Central air conditioner, which contains heating, free broadband access.The hotel provides a free agent to contact the taxi business."
1,比去年有较大的进步，尤其服务方面。毕竟加入了最佳西方的管理体系。早餐不错,"It has made great progress than last year, especially in terms of service.After all, the best Western management system is added.Breakfast is good"
0,差，太差，极其的差，虽能说明这将酒店的情况。服务差、房间差、设备差，水质和周围环境更差。差的令人发指。,"Poor, too bad, extremely poor, although it can show that the situation of the hotel.The service is poor, the room difference, the equipment is poor, and the water quality and the surrounding environment are worse.Poor is outrageous."
1,友谊宾馆环境优美，空气新鲜，硬件设施还可也，服务比较到位。瓦西里酒馆俄式大餐非常有特色，这里外国人非常多，住在这里如同在国外度假。距宾馆专用海水浴场三分钟路程，跟宣传的一样，我来过北戴河多次，这里环境是最好的，下次来北戴河我还会选择这里。,"The environment of the friendship hotel is beautiful, the air is fresh, the hardware facilities are also available, and the service is in place.The Russian meal of Vasily Pacific is very distinctive. There are many foreigners here, and living here is like vacation abroad.The three -minute journey from the hotel's special seawater bath. As promoted, I have been to Beidaihe many times. The environment here is the best. I will choose here next time I came to Beidaihe."

1,"我订的是行政房,但酒店给我免费升级到公寓房,是他们新的房子,房间设施,装修都非常不错,而且可以延迟退房到3点呢,地理位置好,交通方便,餐饮附近也方便,如果下次去南京我还会住在这里的,我非常喜欢","I booked an administrative house, but the hotel is upgraded to the apartment for free. It is their new house, room facilities, and decoration are very good, and it can be delayed to check out to 3 o'clock.It is also convenient. If I still live here next time I go to Nanjing, I like it very much"
1,非常好的服务，虽然酒店挂牌4星，但服务不比5星差，整个酒店的服务员都很热情，你所见到的每个人都会主动向你问好，该酒店在细节的服务上也做的非常好，如：你在大堂内入座，服务员马上会给你上茶水和毛巾，都是免费的哦；你下出租车，服务员马上会递给你一张卡片，上面有你所乘坐的出租车号码，以免你万一有什么事可以找的到那辆车（因威海出租车的发票上没有车号）。如果一定要找一些酒店的缺点，那就是酒店的餐厅上菜的速度较慢，而且不要点川菜，因厨师不太会做。但不管如何，下次我去威海，还是会去该酒店入住。,"Very good service, although the hotel is listed 4 stars, the service is no worse than 5 stars. The waiters of the entire hotel are very enthusiastic. Everyone you see will take the initiativeOkay, such as: You can seat in the lobby, the waiter will give you tea and towels immediately, all of which are free; you get off the taxi, the waiter will hand it to you with a card, there is a taxi number you take on it, So as not to find the car if you have anything (there is no car number on the invoice of Weihai taxi).If you have to find the shortcomings of some hotels, it is the slow speed of the restaurant in the hotel, and don't order Sichuan cuisine, because the chef does not know it.But no matter what, next time I go to Weihai, I will still go to the hotel."
1,220的房费，房间非常大，不象上海的经济型酒店，估计这是汉庭收购来的酒店吧！惊喜的是浴室除了有浴缸外竟然还有一个淋浴房，还是很多喷头的那种。大堂有点小！,"The 220 room fee, the room is very large, not like Shanghai's economy hotel, it is estimated that this is a hotel acquired by Hanting!The surprise is that in addition to the bathtub, there is a shower room, which is still the kind of many nozzles.The lobby is a bit small!"
1,"酒店给人感觉很温欣,服务员也挺有礼貌,房间内的舒适度也非常不错,离开李公递也很近,下次来苏州,还会选择该酒店!","The hotel feels very gentle, the waiter is also very polite, and the comfort in the room is very good. Leaving Li Gongdian is also very close. Next time I come to Suzhou, I will choose the hotel!"
0,一分钟一块钱的网费，贵的惊人。三个门，只有中间的转门开放，其他的门都封了(不知原因)，没有门童给我推门或接行李，只有两之手拿行李，用脚踢门转。早餐很难吃也就罢了。午饭想点菜，但被告知只有自助餐提供。把浴巾放在浴缸里希望更换，晚上看到更换的浴巾上竟然有毛发。希望只是小姐把浴缸里的毛巾又叠过放回浴巾架上而已，不然真的很恶心。真不知道标榜四星的这家酒店怎么还不如地方上三星的小酒店。住此酒店不如找一家商务旅馆。,"The online fee of one dollar for one minute is amazing.The three doors are only open in the middle, and the other doors are blocked (unknown for the reason). No door children push me the door or pick up my luggage. Only the two hands hold the luggage and kick the door with your feet.Breakfast is hard to eat.I want to order lunch, but I was told that only buffets were provided.Put the bath towel in the bathtub and want to replace it. At night, I saw a hair on the shower towel.I hope that the lady will stack the towels in the bathtub and put it back on the bath towel, otherwise it is really disgusting.I really don't know why this hotel that advertised the Four Stars is not as good as Samsung's small hotel in the place.It is better to find a business hotel in this hotel."
1,服务真的很好，我是看了携程的好评才去住的，不过没有让我失望，感觉到五星的酒店有五星的服务，下次去青岛还会选择这里，以后有机会要带一家人在这里度假，真的是在这里住的很惬意，很愉快，很舒服。,"The service is really good. I only went to live after watching Ctrip's praise, but I didn't let me down. I felt that the five -star hotel had five -star service. I will choose here next time I go to Qingdao.On vacation here, I really live here very comfortably, very pleasant, and comfortable."
1,一年多没来过了，再来住，感觉不错，旧瓶装了新酒，标准房里面的设施基本上都换新了，到处都见到笑脸，看来这里才真正是买方市场，我喜欢员工“巴结”客人的感觉，给他个满分。,"I haven't been here for more than a year, I will live again, it feels good. The old bottles are carried with new wine. The facilities in the standard room are basically new. I see a smiley face everywhere. It seems that it is really the buyer's market. I like employees ""The feeling of the guests gave him a full score."

I think it is worth it. Now it is only 400. I recommend that if you can stay in the three -home house room of this hotel !!.
1,酒店设施比较旧了，但人员的服务还可以，凭房卡在餐厅吃饭还可以打8折，不过那里餐厅的菜价挺贵的，还有就是酒店商场的商品个个都是暴利，我们这里一包中华（硬）一般45元，宾馆里最多也就58，而那里好像要78一包，简直天价，网速不错，最后要告诉携程，携程的价格并不是最低价，照理这么大的定房数量应该拿到更低的价格的，当地很多单位的协议价都比携程的低很多,"The hotel facilities are relatively old, but the service of the personnel is okay. It can still be 20 % off with the house card in the restaurant, but the price of the restaurant is quite expensive, and all the products in the hotel mall are huge profits. We are here.A pack of China (hard) is generally 45 yuan, and the hotel is at most 58, and it seems to be 78 packs there, it is simply a good price, the speed of the Internet is good, and finally I want to tell Ctrip.The number of houses should get a lower price, and the agreement price of many local units is much lower than that of Ctrip."
1,国庆到河南旅游，在郑州国贸住了二晚。地点在郑州西南，出行还算方便。房间较大，设备也比较齐全，就是电视机那么老土，对不起五星级的价格。还有宾馆由两座并列的大楼组成，安排的房间正对着隔壁的大楼，窗外什么也没有，实在不爽。服务生都很不错，让我们感受到河南的热情。停车场较大，很方便。,"Traveling to Henan during the National Day and trading in Zhengzhou for two nights.The location is southwest of Zhengzhou, and it is quite convenient to travel.The room is large and the equipment is relatively complete, that is, the television is so old, sorry for the price of five -star.There is also a hotel consisting of two town buildings.

1,房间都可以，摆设同其他酒店的不同；地理位置系荃湾的中心地带，地铁附近，出入还可以；夜晚系附近吃消夜还过得去；周边环境在夜晚比较静，比较安全，旁边有好多住宅楼；下次去还可以考虑，500几文，OK嘎。当然比如心差，但起码房间属于中等（如心的房大、新）。,"The rooms can be used, which is different from other hotels; the geographical location is the center of Tsuen Wan, near the subway, and the access is OK; the night near the night is still through the night; the surrounding environment is relatively quiet at night, safer, there are many residential buildings next to it;I can consider it next time, more than 500 articles, OK Ga.Of course, the heart is poor, but at least the room belongs to medium (such as the big house, the new house, the new)."
1,看过了这里的点评，去的时候还真犹豫，怕万一不灵。轮渡有专门停靠酒店的航班，一小时一班，去的时候是四月三十号，人不多，订的是海景房，进了房间，发现设施真的就像点评上说的，二星酒店的感觉。但环境相当好，一个大阳台正对着大海，正前方100米就是鼓浪石。晚上，先生把椅子和台子挪到阳台上，对着大海，喝奶茶聊天。半夜惊醒，坐在阳台上，实在感觉睡不着，先生建议，去海滩走走……星空下，我们赤足走在沙滩上，听着海涛声和海鸥的鸣叫，这才真正明白，什么叫天长地久。喜欢这个酒店，不是因为它的设施，而是因为它的地理环境，离海滩只有50米的距离！如果你无法享受安静，请离它远点，而我，却爱上了这里。我们第二天订的是厦门的鹭江，可感觉上却还没有这里好，下次来，一定还是住这里！！！服务也不错，房间虽然旧了点，但该有的也都有了，另外自助早餐的位置也很好，就在鼓浪石前，喝粥看看海鸥，还是很写意的。,"After watching the comments here, I really hesitated when I went, in case of uncle.There are flights to stop at the hotel, one hour, and it is April 30th when I go.a feeling of.But the environment is quite good. A large balcony is facing the sea, and 100 meters in front of them are drumsticks.In the evening, Mr. moved the chair and table to the balcony, and chatted with milk tea in the sea.Wake up in the middle of the night, sitting on the balcony, I really feel that I can't sleep. My husband suggested to go to the beach ... Under the starry sky, we walked on the beach barefoot, listening to the sound of the sound of Haitao and the seagulls.EssenceI like this hotel, not because of its facilities, but because of its geographical environment, only 50 meters away from the beach!If you can't enjoy quiet, please stay away from it, but I am in love with it.The next day we ordered Lugjiang in Xiamen, but it felt that it was not good yet. Next time, we must still live here!IntersectionIntersectionThe service is also good. Although the room is a bit old, there should be all the time. In addition, the location of the buffet breakfast is also very good. Just in front of Gulong Stone, drink porridge to see the seagulls, it is still very freehand."
1,我们第一次入住的是10楼标准间，海景非常美。记得第一天早上起来，看见那海和海上停泊的渔船，心里豁的一下子。酒店位置非常好，离市中心只几步路，购物及吃饭非常方便。第二次入住的是5楼的房间，比起10楼的海景相差不少。建议如有可能要高层的房间。,"The first time we stayed in the 10th floor standard room, the sea view was very beautiful.I remember getting up on the first morning and seeing the fishing boats parked at the sea and the sea, my heart was suddenly.The hotel location is very good, only a few steps from the city center, it is very convenient to shop and eat.The second room was on the 5th floor, which was much different from the sea view on the 10th floor.It is recommended to have a high -rise room if possible."
0,标准间太差房间还不如3星的而且设施非常陈旧.建议酒店把老的标准间从新改善.,The standard room is too bad. The room is not as good as 3 stars and the facilities are very old. It is recommended that the hotel will improve the old standard room from.
1,从携程的点评找到的这个徐州最佳酒店。一个字，好！好到我虽然订了一天，但是实在喜欢，又续订了一天。从徐州市内穿过，一直觉得城市很一般，跟中国多数城市一样，几乎没有特色。但是转了一个弯，突然就是眼前一亮。当开元大酒店出现在面前的时候，感觉就是惊艳。大堂很气派，但是进入大门后你会很难找到前台，因为她们都在对着大门不远处坐成一排呢，就是自认为经历无数旅行的我也惭愧了。房间是580的，很典雅，家具的设计是蛮有特色的，尤其是卫生间，非常别致，宽敞、精致，我感觉是国内这个价位内屈指可数的。房间也很宽敞，如果是三口之家，完全不用加床。晚上吃饭，LG去酒店饭店点菜，让送饭来房间，徐州虽然是江苏的，但是盘子的尺寸已经跟山东一样了。菜量太足了，绝对吃不完，而且送菜的服务生态度非常好，让客人有宾至如归的感觉。总之，真是一个物超所值的酒店，续订了一天，因为实在喜欢。,"This Xuzhou best hotel found from Ctrip's review.A word, good!Although I booked for a day, I really liked it and renewed another day.From Xuzhou City, I always feel that the city is very average. Like most cities in China, there are almost no characteristics.But after turning a curved, it was suddenly bright.When Kaiyuan Hotel appeared in front of it, it felt stunning.The lobby is very elegant, but after entering the gate, you will be difficult to find the front desk, because they are sitting in a row not far from the door, that is, I am ashamed that I think I have experienced countless travels.The room is 580, which is very elegant. The design of the furniture is quite distinctive, especially the bathroom. It is very chic, spacious and exquisite. I feel that there are only one in the domestic price.The room is also very spacious. If it is a family of three, there is no need to add bed at all.In the evening, LG went to the hotel to order food and let me send meals to the room. Although Xuzhou was from Jiangsu, the size of the plate was the same as Shandong.The amount of vegetables is too sufficient, and it is absolutely not eaten, and the service of the delivery service is very good, so that guests have the feeling of seeking guests.In short, it is really a value -watest hotel, renewing it for a day, because I really like it."
0,"前台的服待客人都是不耐的子,住酒店的大概都是地人士,教一些地的是的,度真是不好;另外,居然有忙打的服.....;房及其他施,算是可以.","At the front desk, the guests are impatient, and the hotels who live in the hotel are probably locals. The one who teaches some places is not good; in addition, there are busy clothes ...;Others, can be regarded."
1,几次入住戚家山宾馆感觉都很好，总台接待热情，客房服务员工作到位，客房条件不错，就是卫生间没有换气扇，通风略差，宽带很方便，就是感觉速度有点慢。以后再来这里出差，还选择住在这里。,"Several time to stay in Qijiashan Hotel feels very good, the main station is enthusiastic, the guest room waiters are in place, and the guest rooms are in good condition. It is that the bathroom does not change the air fan. The ventilation is slightly worse. The broadband is very convenient. It feels a bit slow.Come here to travel here and choose to live here."
1,"我是7月5号6号住了两天,本来是城景房的,因为我去的时候没房,给我免费升级到可看到30%海景房,酒店房间还不错,纯白色,交通也便利,酒店下面就有空调旅游巴士去大东海亚龙湾和机场.去春园海鲜城也很近.唯一不足的是房间没有浴缸,总体来说还不错,下次去还会入住.","I lived on July 5th for two days on July 5th. It was originally from the city view room, because I did n’t have a room when I went, and I was upgraded to 30%of the sea view room for free.It is also convenient. There is a air -conditioned tourist bus under the hotel to Yalong Bay and the airport in Dadonghai. It is also very close to Chunyuan Seafood City. The only insufficient room is that the room does not have a bathtub. Generally speaking, I will stay in."
1,首先应该讲携程的服务是非常到位的，为本人提供了不少方便。其次讲讲扬子岛酒店好的地方：1、位置真是好的没话讲，距解放碑步行只要两分钟不到，周边吃的、买的、看的都很多。2、服务员很热情，尤其是门童，这也是很多人肯定的。3、设施较全，大厅的马桶旁边都有垫纸（这一点应该是其他的很多做的不好的地方），当然与它的大厅在七楼应该也有很大关系。4、房价根据时间做调整，周一比周六便宜。重点讲讲不足：1、预订信息不准确。本来预订时说没有大床房，所以定了两个标间，但入住时又给了一个大床房，之前没有通知；2、大床房没有标准间大，而且相差很大；3、房间在刚进时有异味，虽然不太明显；4、烧开水的壶大多上盖损坏；5、卫生间没有吹风机，是另配的，我住的那间卫生间的插座有问题，吹风机只能在外面用，可是外面又没有镜子；6、下午五点多服务员就上门进行夜床服务，时间实在是太早了；7、保险箱有问题，按说明是无论如何用不了的，我和服务员按说明摆弄了半天都不能用，都已经报修时，突然又好了。8、水龙头只有一个，没有专用的饮水龙头。9、消防通道又偏又不干净。至于有的朋友所说电梯慢的问题，我个人感觉如果不坐观光电梯的话，速度还是可以的。而观景房实际上大多看不到什么景则是位置所限，周围都是高楼，没办法。,"First of all, it should be said that Ctrip's service is very in place, providing a lot of convenience for me.Secondly, it is good to talk about Yangzima Hotel: 1. The location is really good. It is only less than two minutes before the Jiefang Bei walking.2. The waiter is very enthusiastic, especially the gatekeeper, which is also sure of many people.3. The facilities are relatively complete. There are pads next to the toilet of the lobby (this should be a lot of other places that do not do well). Of course, it should have a lot to do with its lobby on the seventh floor.4. House prices are adjusted according to time, and it is cheaper on Monday than Saturday.The focus is inadequate: 1. The booking information is inaccurate.I said that there was no big bed room when booking, so I set up two standard rooms, but I gave a large bed room when I stayed.There is a odor when I first entered, although it is not obvious; 4. The pots that boil water are mostly covered with damage; 5. There is no hair dryer in the bathroom.Use, but there is no mirror outside; 6. At 5 pm, the waiter came to the door to provide the night bed service. The time is too early; 7. There is a problem with the safe.It can't be used for a long time, and it has been repaired, and suddenly it is better.8. There is only one faucet, there is no dedicated faucet.9. The fire channel is not clean.As for some friends said that the elevator is slow, I personally feel that if you don't take a sightseeing elevator, the speed is still okay.In fact, most of the viewing rooms are limited by the location, there are high -rise buildings around, there is no way."
1,不错哦，但是携程的价格还是偏高的。和公司的协议价差距比较大，其实以携程的订房量就是酒店最大的协议客户了，价格应该最低才对，让利客户。中信酒店是不错的，环境，房间都可以。,"Yes, but the price of Ctrip is still high.The price gap with the company's agreement is relatively large. In fact, Ctrip's booking volume is the largest agreement customer in the hotel. The price should be the lowest to make it possible for customers.CITIC Hotel is good, the environment, the rooms are available."
1,"这次还不错,但是房间里面的花太不符合格调了.","This time it is not bad, but the flowers in the room are not tuned in line."
1,房间设施比较旧，餐饮贵，服务不错，没有任何景观。外观比狮林好点,"The room facilities are relatively old, the catering is expensive, the service is good, and there is no landscape.The appearance is better than the lion forest"
1,如果一个人住，挑18号的大床房，两面有窗户，光线好。房间的环境不过不失，就是空调声稍微大些，但上网速度奇快！down一部400多兆的电影用了约4分钟！有水果送，服务态度比较好！以前楼下咖啡厅有免费下午茶送，但现在取消了，有点过份！早餐简单，不算好。到市区办事还算方便，酒店大堂出去转左的小巷口有个吃粉的地方，价格便宜好吃（自我感觉）。总体喜欢此酒店！,"If you live alone, pick a large bed in the 18th, there are windows on both sides, and the light is good.The environment of the room is not lost, that is, the sound of air conditioning is slightly louder, but the speed of Internet access is strange!DOWN has a 400 -meter movie for about 4 minutes!There are fruits, and the service attitude is better!In the past, the coffee shop downstairs had free afternoon tea, but now it is canceled, it is a bit too much!Breakfast is simple, not good.It is quite convenient to go to the urban area. There is a place to eat powder to go out to the left alley at the hotel lobby. The price is cheap and delicious (self -feeling).I like this hotel overall!"
1,"一家三口刚从开元回来,是个挺不错的度假酒店。酒店里所有的员工包括清洁工阿姨都会很礼貌地跟你打招呼，感觉特亲切，酒店服务也很好。跟亚龙湾希尔顿有点像，只是规模小了点，不过对于上海周边地区来讲，已经是一家很不错的度假酒店了。中餐厅不错，是个性价比挺高的五星餐厅。房间设施一般，特别是电视机和装电视的柜子，本人觉得很老土的，最好换成42寸的液晶电视机和简洁的电视柜。不过，总的来讲，还是挺不错的，以后有机会我们还会再来。哈哈！","The family of three just returned from Kaiyuan and was a pretty good resort.All employees in the hotel, including auntie aunts, will greet you politely, feel very kind, and the hotel service is also very good.It is a bit like Yalong Bay Hilton, but it is a bit smaller, but for the surrounding areas of Shanghai, it is already a very good resort hotel.Chinese restaurants are good and are a five -star restaurant with high cost -effectiveness.The room facilities are average, especially the TV and TV cabinets. I feel very old. It is best to replace it with a 42 -inch LCD TV and simple TV cabinet.However, in general, it is quite good, and we will come again in the future.Ha ha!"
1,能在吉林市找到的最好的酒店了。入住和退房的速度还可以。房间状况不错，床不如长春的天天舒服，感觉比较硬。,The best hotel can be found in Jilin City.The speed of staying and checking out.The room is in good condition. The bed is not as comfortable every day as Changchun.
1,感觉房间还可以，从设施和布局来看就知道是比较老的酒店了。早餐还算丰盛.宾馆反馈2008年4月19日：感谢您的支持!,"I feel that the room is okay. From the perspective of facilities and layouts, I know that it is a relatively old -fashioned hotel.Breakfast is rich. Hotel feedback on April 19, 2008: Thank you for your support!"
1,同学在附近上班，推荐的酒店。总体还可以，傍晚电梯旁有个穿白色礼服的小姐站在那里迎宾，那礼服怎么看都像婚纱，如果不是她旁边没有新郎样子的人并且她没有做头发，还真以为她是在那里办婚宴的呢。早餐选择少了点。,"Students work nearby, recommended hotels.Overall, there is a young lady in a white dress next to the elevator standing there to welcome the guests. The dress looks like a wedding dress.Wedding for a wedding banquet.There is less breakfast."
1,三月入住的五号楼豪华间，酒店的环境真的不错，从室内的陈列到窗外的景色，以及酒店内花园都显得华贵而清幽。酒店早上的自助餐也很好吃，中西式的都有，而且选择也还算多。唯一欠缺的是，由于第一天入住酒店时间较晚，希望第二天退房后再去泡温泉，却被告知不能享受酒店客人的优惠价格，感到不太公平...宾馆反馈2008年3月29日：尊敬的客人，您好！您的意见我们已提交相给相关部门的领导，今后会根据实际情况酌情考虑温泉优惠价格的时限。,"In the luxury room of Building 5 in March, the hotel's environment is really good. From indoor display to the scenery outside the window, and the garden in the hotel looks luxurious and quiet.The hotel's buffet in the morning is also delicious, both Chinese and Western style, and there are many choices.The only lack of lack is that because the hotel is late on the first day of the hotel, I hope to go to the hot spring after checking out the next day, but I was told that they could not enjoy the preferential price of hotel guests, and I felt that it was not fair ... hotel feedback 2008 3rd 3rd in 2008March 29: Dear guest, hello!In your opinion, we have submitted to the leaders of relevant departments, and in the future, we will consider the time limit of hot spring preferential prices as appropriate according to the actual situation."
1,整个酒店比较老款，不过酒店的客房设计非常摩登洁净，除了面积比较小（不管是行政楼层还是一般楼层，似乎都是一样的大小），其他均满意。,"The entire hotel is relatively old, but the hotel's guest room design is very modern and clean. Except for the small area (whether it is an administrative floor or a general floor, it seems the same size), and others are satisfied."
1,"3星的硬件,4星的外观,5星的服务房间设施比较陈旧,但服务非常的好,头一次碰到3星的酒店里任何一个服务人员见到你都会微笑问好的,如果设施再好些是个不错的酒店","The 3 -star hardware, the appearance of 4 stars, the 5 -star service room facilities are relatively old, but the service is very good. For the first time, any service staff in a 3 -star hotel will smile and ask if you see you.It's a good hotel"
1,"以往都住上海苏州一些品牌五星的酒店,昆山这个地方还没有什么真正国际品牌入驻,就选了这家本地酒店.大堂和用餐的地方格局似乎不是很好,大堂空间不大,动线也有点乱.入住时碰到有团队在Checkin,感觉比较吵.不过实惠倒是真的,中午西餐的商业午餐才88元,品种相当丰富,口味也可以.要是在上海可能这点钱是吃不到什么东西.另外,出来进去大堂里员工都会对我热情微笑,打招呼.回想起来,住了那么多号称国际品牌管理的大饭店,员工不是只围着老外做服务就是一幅冷面孔.看来国内这些本土酒店是要好好想想如何把自己的品牌擦亮了.宾馆反馈2008年8月14日：尊敬的客人:您好感谢您对君豪酒店的选择与支持,关于您所反映的大堂的问题,这一点确实是我们的不足,所以我们在客房内的硬件配备和整个酒店的软件服务上比其它酒店投入了更多的成本和心血,希望能让每一位宾客住得满意!还要感谢您对我们酒店员工服务的肯定,期待您下次入住!","In the past, there were some five -star hotels in Suzhou, Shanghai Suzhou. There was no real international brand settled in this place in Kunshan. The local hotel and dining local pattern of the lobby and dining seemed to be very good.Inessed. I encountered a team in Checkin when I stayed, but I felt more noisy.In addition, the employees in the lobby will smile enthusiastically and say hello to me. In retrospect, I have lived in so many big restaurants that are known as international brand management. Employees are either used to serve foreigners.The local hotel is to think about how to brighten your brand. Hotel feedback on August 14, 2008: Dear guest: Hello, thank you for your choice and support for Junhao Hotel, about the lobby you reflectedThis is indeed our shortcomings, so we have invested more costs and efforts in the hardware equipment in the guest room and the software services of the entire hotel than other hotels. I hope that every guest can be satisfied with!Your affirmation of our hotel employees, look forward to your next stay!"
1,16楼新装修的房间有些味道，房间装修得还不错，就是有点小，卫生间的淋浴间是全玻璃的，有点意思，也很大，不过卫生间总体有点小。液晶的电视很赞的说。第一次住这家酒店，以前住金海湾比较多，周边没什么商业，就是风景好。这家的地理位置比较好，周边很繁华，交通也很方便。虽然是四星，硬件上比金海湾要差一点，但是软件服务还是很不错的，对客人的要求相应的比较及时，服务态度和服务意识也很不错，赞一下，以后去烟台还会考虑住在这里。,"The newly renovated room on the 16th floor has some taste. The room decoration is pretty good. It is a bit small. The bathroom shower room is all glass, which is a bit interesting and very large, but the bathroom is generally a bit small.LCD TV is very good.For the first time I lived in this hotel, I used to live a lot of Jinwan, and there was no business around, but the scenery was good.The geographical location is better, the surroundings are prosperous, and the traffic is very convenient.Although it is a four -star, the hardware is worse than the Golden Bay, but the software service is still very good. The requirements for the guests are relatively timely, and the service attitude and service awareness are also very good.it's here."
1,只有一点，我住的南楼没有电梯，房间还很贵,"There is only one point, there is no elevator in the south building where I live, and the room is still very expensive"
1,明明信用卡担保了.跑过去住说没有房间了.只好升级.最后酒店没有收升级的钱.但是还是很不愉快.不过酒店是不错的.万豪的管理不错.,"Obviously the credit card was guaranteed. I ran over and said that there was no room. I had to upgrade. In the end, the hotel did not collect the money. But it was still very unpleasant. But the hotel is good. Marriott's management is good."
0,370的房间，性价比很低，也就内地150的水平，自助餐品种那是相当的少，成天一堆喝得红赤胡脸的中年FB男出入，很不爽，决不再住,"The 370 room is very cost -effective. For the level of 150 in the Mainland, there are quite few buffet varieties. The middle -aged FB men who drink red and red face all day long are uncomfortable."
0,"优点：的确是标准的海景房，从窗户就能看到大海。交通比较方便，对面有大润发超市，晚上可以在滨海路上散步缺点：太多了;1,设施太陈旧了，地毯到处都是黑污渍，房间有股怪味，虽然3星级不能要求太多，但也不能比那种经济型酒店还差吧；2，酒店客房和写字楼是连在一起的，客房走廊力有人走来走去，很没有安全感；3，服务水平很差，前台服务员可以吃着口香糖和我说话，服务非常不规范。4，希望两点退房，这几乎是所有酒店都能接收的，但被生硬的拒绝。结论：打死不住第二会！","Advantages: It is indeed a standard seaside room, and the sea can be seen from the window.The transportation is more convenient. There is a RT -Mart supermarket on the opposite side. At night, you can take the shortcomings on Binhai Road: too much; 1, the facilities are too old, the carpets are black stain everywhere, and the room has strange flavor. Although 3 stars can not be required too much,But it can't be worse than that kind of economy hotel;Speaking of gum talking to me, the service is very irregular.4. I hope to check out at two o'clock, which can be received almost all hotels, but they are rejected hard.Conclusion: Can't kill the second meeting!"
1,很不错的一家酒店。不仅给我们一家三口免费升级到海景套房，服务也是蛮周到的。第一晚入住时要了一双拖鞋，第二天回房后发现拖鞋又添了好几双。酒店前台的服务也很细致，免费提供香港的旅游地图，还有各路大巴的路线图，可以用人民币做押金，可以兑换零钱。不过酒店的大床房确实小，就是每层的01号房间，建议不要1号房。出门左拐，周围的小吃店非常多。那个森发云吞店非常实惠，鲜虾馅的云吞让我感觉奢侈。香港的鱼不贵，很多香港市民都是要一条鱼要一碗米饭当午餐。我们没敢要鱼，就点了一个西芹炒鸡块，味道不怎么好，结帐的时候才知道鱼跟炒菜一个价，都是30港币，好后悔啊。门口的交通非常方便，当当车可以代步到很多地方，只是当当车的速度很慢，走走停停，如果没有急事的话可以坐在上层前面的坐位，这样更方便的浏览香港的街景，也很不错啊。门口后边有一家卖手机卡的小店，60面额的那种打内地才0.25一分钟，非常便宜。补充点评2008年6月24日：对了，门口有去机场的大巴。前面网友说的去海洋公园的973和去迪斯尼的A12问了很多香港当地人，他们都不推荐，所以我们还是没有冒险尝试。,"Very good hotel.Not only is we upgraded to the sea -view suite for free, the service is also very thoughtful.When I stayed in the first night, I asked a pair of slippers, and after returning to the room, I found that the slippers added several pairs.The service of the hotel's front desk is also very detailed. It provides Hong Kong travel maps for free, as well as the roadmap of various buss, which can be used as a deposit and can be exchanged for change.However, the large bed room of the hotel is indeed small, that is, Room 01 of each floor. It is recommended not to Room 1.Turn left and go left, there are a lot of snack bars around.The Senfa Wonton shop is very affordable, and the wonton of fresh shrimp stuffing makes me feel luxurious.Hong Kong's fish are not expensive. Many Hong Kong citizens want a fish for a bowl of rice as lunch.We didn't dare to ask for fish, so we ordered a frying chicken nugget for celery. The taste was not very good. I only knew that the fish and the fried food were at the checkout. They were all 30 Hong Kong dollars, so I regret it.The traffic at the door is very convenient. When the car can be traded to many places, it is just that the speed of the car is very slow. If you don't have an urgent matter, you can sit in front of the upper layer.nice.Behind the door, there is a small shop selling mobile phone cards. The 60 -faced type of hitting the Mainland is only 0.25 a minute, which is very cheap.Supplementary comment on June 24, 2008: By the way, there is a bus to the airport at the door.The netizens said that the 973 of the Ocean Park and the A12 who went to Disney asked a lot of Hong Kong locals. They did not recommend it, so we still did not try to try."
1,"门前在修路,尘土飞扬的，又吵，第一感觉不太好。里面的设施、服务一般化，张家借这个地方，整体水平都不咋样，也算过得去了。","The road was in front of the door, the dust was flying, and noisy. The first feeling was not very good.The facilities and services inside are generally different. The overall level of the Zhang family borrows this place is not good."
1,我定的是大床房间，房间够大，如果没有其他需求睡觉是够了，床舒服。洗手间虽然该有的都有，但装修简陋。酒店人员的服务80分，不要和四星级五星级比较啦。打车到虹桥机场18元，从机场来时被司机绕了弯子，花掉33元。大家注意。,"I set a large bed room, the room is large enough. If there is no other need to sleep, it is enough, and the bed is comfortable.Although there should be everything, the decoration is simple.The service of hotel staff is 80 points, don't compare with the four -star and five -star.Taxi to Hongqiao Airport was 18 yuan. When he came from the airport, he was bent by the driver and spent 33 yuan.Pay attention."
1,房间一般，设施还可以，环境吗只能说还行，早餐还算丰富，在自贡嘛也没什么好选的了。,"The room is average, the facilities are okay, can the environment only say that it is okay, the breakfast is rich, and there is no good choice in Zigong."
1,非常喜欢居家的感觉，尽管逗留的时间只有两天，很多设备都用不上，但全套餐具、厨具以及餐桌、餐椅和DVD、音响，这一切，都给我家的感觉。与酒店的感觉实在不一样。下次会再来。但携程的价格实在缺乏竞争力，仅仅是前台价扣减早餐费而已。,"I like the feeling of home very much. Although it is only two days of staying, many equipment is not used, but a full set of tableware, kitchen utensils, dining tables, dining chairs and DVDs, and audio, all this gives my family feel.It feels different from the hotel.Will come again next time.But Ctrip's price is really competitive, just to deduct breakfast fees at the front desk price."
1,环境不错。交通也便利。服务不错。下次还会考虑的,The environment is good.Transportation is also convenient.The service is good.I will consider next time
0,父母自驾去北海游玩，于2008-5-24晚入住该酒店，订的是豪华大床房！第二天下午就接到妈妈的电话，说这个酒店的“豪华房”简直不是为人准备的，是用来养鸟的，据她说整个“豪华间”面积大概不到15平米，尤其是卫生间，最多2个平米，实在无法舒适使用！于是第二天他们就换了宾馆，随便在市区内找一家只要100多，还送双早！此家宾馆唯一的优势就是离海不远，周边环境比较宁静，但是提醒要入住的朋友，一定要记得先看房间！！！,"Parents went to Beihai to play, and entered the hotel in the evening in 2008-5-24.I received a call from my mother the next afternoon, saying that the ""luxury house"" of this hotel was not prepared for people, and was used to raise birds. According to her, the entire ""luxury room"" area was less than 15 square meters, especially the bathroom, especially the bathroom, especially the bathroom, especially the bathroom, Up to 2 square meters, it is really unable to use it!So the next day they changed the hotel, just found more than 100 in the city, and gave it early!The only advantage of this hotel is not far from the sea, and the surrounding environment is relatively quiet, but friends who want to stay in, must remember to look at the room first!IntersectionIntersection"
1,因为偏淡季去，当时携程280的报价还可以，酒店给的报价是打7折。酒店对面就是大海，但晚上没有灯，太黑。酒店很干净，特别是酒店服务员的态度很好。咨询旅游事宜很耐心、实用。离开时忘记带凉拖，多亏服务员的提醒。唯一的遗憾是被分在挨着走廊的位置，跟旁边房比视觉上肯定小。,"Because of the off -season, the offer of Ctrip 280 was okay at the time, and the hotel's offer was 50 % off.Opposite the hotel is the sea, but there is no light at night, too dark.The hotel is very clean, especially the hotel waiter's attitude is very good.Consulting tourism is very patient and practical.Forgot to bring a mop when you leave, thanks to the reminder of the waiter.The only regret is that it is divided into the corridor position, and it is definitely smaller than the next room."
0,两星级的设施(可能还没有)，四星的收费标准。真不知道四星级是怎么评下来的。和携程宣传有很大的区别。比如说有酒吧，原来是房间内食品。,"Two -star facilities (maybe not yet), four -star charging standards.I really don't know how the four -star rating was commented.There is a big difference with Ctrip promotion.For example, there is a bar, it turned out to be food in the room."
1,装修很新，设施很全，条件不错。服务人员秉承了北京人的“范儿”，属于“高傲不热情”那种，很难对“服务”本身评价一声“满意”。不过10层的清洗大嫂到是满不错的，很热心的询问是否做房间清洁……,"The decoration is new, the facilities are complete, and the conditions are good.The service staff adhering to the ""Fan Er"" of Beijingers and belongs to the kind of ""proud and not enthusiastic"". It is difficult to evaluate ""satisfaction"" on the ""service"" itself.However, the 10 -story cleaning is full of good. I enthusiastically asked whether to make a room clean ..."
1,"我是5月8日到9日定的贵宾楼层高级间[含早],给我的感觉是:---地理位置极佳,就在金融街附近---房间非常大和非常舒适,包双早,才1000块多一点,非常合算---唯一不好的是大堂在装修,搞得有点失礼,其他的都很好总体来说是一家不错的酒店,够了4星级标准!","I am the senior room of the VIP floor from May 8th to 9th.Early, it was only a little more than 1,000 yuan. It was very cost-effective-the only bad thing was that the lobby was renovating. It was a bit rude. Others were good. Generally speaking, it is a good hotel, which is enough for 4-star standards!"
0,酒店很差，虽然挂牌4星，但只有准3星的感觉，房间是很大，但设施一般，灯光太暗。海景房是是远远望去才可以看到。房间里有霉的味道，虽然不强烈。虽然是1月，房间里有蚊子，咬了不少包。440的价格还要加政府税13元多，不包括早餐和宽带，宽带10元一小时，50元一天，早餐是广东式早茶单点，有些浪费时间，算来也要530－550左右，这个价格在上海、北京、广州都可以住很象样的四星。希望Ctrip找好一点的酒店，当地的假日的价格又有点高，虽然没住过但我信任假日的品牌。其他是否可以去找一些比较好的四星？,"The hotel is very poor. Although it is listed for 4 stars, it only feels like 3 stars. The room is very large, but the facilities are average and the lights are too dark.The sea view room can be seen from a distance.The smell of mold in the room is not strong.Although in January, there were mosquitoes in the room and bit a lot of bags.The price of 440 also has more than 13 yuan for government taxes, excluding breakfast and broadband. Broadband is 10 yuan an hour, 50 yuan a day. Breakfast is a single point of Cantonese -style early tea. Some waste time.The price can live in Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou.I hope that CTRIP will find a better hotel. The price of local holidays is a bit high. Although I have never lived, I have trusted the holiday brand.Can others find some better four stars?"
0,实在忍无可忍。1、水。缺水现象――洗澡至中途，突然断水，望着满身的肥皂泡欲哭无泪；多水现象――有幸目睹了水漫金山的壮观景象。我们住在2楼，半夜，只听到哗哗的水声，之后从房顶上渗出的水，蔓延了整个房间，我们淌着水冲进房间，只见被子已全部湿透，庆幸的是放行李的地方还未受灾，赶紧进行抢救行动。2、安全。大概山上已经提早进入了共产主义社会，客房有门等于没门，服务员可以拿着房卡随意进入任何已经入住客人的客房。半夜，我们已经入睡，可是突然有人开门进来，当我惊醒但还处于迷茫状态的时候，只见服务员在我的房间内若无其事的巡视。我感到自己的人身安全受到了严重的威胁。就这样被折腾了一夜，一宿未睡啊！现在是头昏脑涨、鼻涕一把、心有余悸阿！总结，千万别住在这样的度假村内了，黑店阿。,"It is unbearable.1. Water.The phenomenon of water deficiency -bathing until the middle, suddenly the water was broken, looking at the soap full of soap, crying without tears; the phenomenon of water -was fortunate to see the spectacular scene of the water.We lived on the second floor, in the middle of the night, only heard the sound of water, and then the water exuded from the roof spread the entire room. We rushed into the room with water.The place where the luggage was not affected, and the rescue operation was quickly.2. Safe.Probably on the mountain, the mountain has entered the communist society early. There is a door in the guest room. The waiter can take the room card to enter any guest room where the guests who have already stayed in.In the middle of the night, we had fallen asleep, but suddenly someone opened the door. When I was awake but was still confused, I saw the waiter's inspection in my room.I feel that my personal safety has been severely threatened.I was tossed all night, and I didn't sleep!Now it's dizzy, snot, and heartache!To sum up, don't live in such a resort, black shop."
1,携程只能订到老楼，贵宾楼订不到。前台服务员给我做了升级，升至豪华房。装修有点老了。不过太仓本来就没什么好酒店，也就这家是五星级的了,"Ctrip can only be booked to the old building, and the VIP building cannot be booked.The front desk waiter upgraded me and rose to a luxury room.The decoration is a bit old.However, there is no good hotel in Taicang, and this is a five -star one."
0,9月20日入住。总的来说：失望！开始拿到的房间，房间内充满很强烈的烟味，实在忍受不住，要求换房，不知是否前台有意见，给换了一间比前一间小的多的房，算了，将就一下睡一个晚上吧，心想。但一躺到床上发现不对劲，床垫中间是凹下去的，没办法躺的舒服，又不敢再叫换房了，不知再会出现什么问题。只好整个晚上睡在床垫的边上（那里没有凹），但整天晚上提心吊胆的怕掉下床！郁闷！,"Check in September 20.Overall: disappointment!The room I started, the room was full of strong smoke, and I couldn't bear it. I asked for a house to change the house. I wonder if there was an opinion on the front desk.Sleep a night, think.But when I lay on the bed and found something wrong, the middle of the mattress was recessed. There was no way to lie comfortably, and I didn't dare to call a house again. I don't know what problems will occur.I had to sleep on the edge of the mattress all night (there was no concave there), but I was afraid of falling out of bed all night!depressed!"
1,酒店离报国寺和车站都很近；房间整洁干净；瑜珈温泉作为峨眉四大温泉之一，住店客人只需50元/人性价比较高；早餐非常丰富；唯一的缺点是１号楼楼道比较复杂，象个小迷宫，找房间花了一点时间．,"The hotel is very close to Baoguo Temple and the station; the room is neat and clean; Yoga Hot Spring, as one of the four major hot springs of Emei, only costs 50 yuan per person for living shops; the breakfast is very rich; the only disadvantage is that the No. 1 building is comparisonComplex, like a small maze, it took a little time to find a room."
1,房间装修不错，可能是走道的最后一间房，无论空调设定几度，总是感觉偏热。早餐不错，地理位置有点偏。,"The room decoration is good. It may be the last room of the aisle. No matter how much the air conditioning is set, it always feels hot.Breakfast is good, and the geographical location is a bit biased."
1,"酒店的位置不错,面对漓江,但是房间内设施不好,洗面盆和淋浴的水笼头都漏水,房间地毯不仅不平整,看上去还挺脏,让人不舒服.中餐厅卫生状况不好,餐具不干净,苍蝇多.早餐以主食为主,没什么下饭的菜,牛奶是用奶粉冲的,管饱不管好!酒店客人团队多.","The hotel's location is good. In the face of the Lijiang River, the facilities in the room are not good. The noodles and the water cage head of the washbasin and the shower are leaking.The tableware is not clean and there are many flies. The breakfast is mainly staple food. There is no dish for meals. Milk is rushed with milk powder."

0,这家号称当地最好挂牌4星的酒店真的名不副实，酒店家具房间都很陈旧，特别是2号楼，有点恐怖住里面！慎用！！！,"This hotel, which claims to be the best local listing, is really unrealistic. The hotel's furniture rooms are very old, especially Building 2, which is a bit horrible!Use with caution!IntersectionIntersection"
0,设施很陈旧，卫生间真的有够脏的，没有电梯,"The facilities are very old, the bathroom is really dirty, there is no elevator"
0,"电梯很慢,而且只有一部.门面不行.房间小的可以,2个人入住房间里转个身都难!还有就是第2天发现洗手间没纸了,打了3个电话才送上来...不过房间挺温馨,书桌上有3本书籍提供,在其他酒店挺少见","The elevator is very slow, and there is only one. The facade is not good. The room is small. It is difficult to turn around in the room in the room! Also, I found that there was no paper in the bathroom on the second day, and I sent 3 calls to send it ..However, the room is quite warm. There are 3 books on the desk, which is very rare in other hotels"
1,非常好。国内最好的酒店之一。各方面都不错。,very good.One of the best hotels in China.All aspects are good.
1,临海木屋住了两晚，写点自己的感受吧。蜈支洲岛很不错，海水清澈，沙滩白细，景色很美，只是不适合游泳。唯一开辟的游泳区域很多珊瑚，扎脚，我就被扎破了。岛上有几个游泳池，倒还算不错，可以一边游泳一边欣赏海景。临海木屋中6688号的景色是最好，如果可以建议预定这间房屋。木屋中设施不错，虽然没有酒店豪华，但是面积不小，而且还算是干净。晚上听着青蛙、小虫、壁虎的鸣叫，感觉很不错。岛上吃的东西比较贵，味道算是一般。西餐厅可以晚上去，一边吃饭一边看夕阳，非常有感觉。中餐厅味道稍微好一点，但是价格不便宜，两个人怎么也要100块钱。建议住在岛上，可以在游客还没有到来的时候感受一下岛上的悠闲生活。我去的时候是淡季，晚上好像是我们两个人的小岛一样。岛上开发不错，服务也很热情，海上项目中觉得摩托艇最刺激，潜水没有参与，但是听说没什么意思。其实在临海木屋下面，也就是岛主别墅对面有一小片沙滩，那里海水清澈，戴上游泳镜就可以潜水，也可以看到小鱼和珊瑚什么的。,"I lived in the sea house for two nights and wrote some of my own feelings.Wuzhizhou Island is very good, the sea is clear, the beach is white, and the scenery is beautiful, but it is not suitable for swimming.There are many corals in the only swimming areas that are opened, and I have been broken.There are a few swimming pools on the island, which is pretty good. You can enjoy the sea view while swimming.The scene of No. 6688 in Linhai Wood House is the best, if it can be recommended to book this house.The facilities in the wooden house are good. Although there is no hotel luxury, the area is not small, and it is clean.Listening to the frog, small worm, and gecko at night, it felt very good.The island is more expensive, and the taste is average.Western restaurants can go at night and watch the sunset while eating.The Chinese restaurant has a little better taste, but the price is not cheap, how can two people cost 100 yuan.It is recommended to live on the island and feel the leisure life on the island when the tourists have not arrived.When I went, it was the off -season, and it seemed like the island of both of us at night.The island is well developed and the service is very enthusiastic. The maritime project feels that motorboats are the most exciting and dive are not involved, but I heard that it is not interesting.In fact, under the Linhai House, there is a small beach opposite the island main villa. The sea water is clear. You can dive with a swimming mirror. You can also see small fish and corals."
1,这次入住的是大床房，房间设施还算可以，没想象中那么旧。浴室好像是新弄过了，还挺干净整洁的。酒店的服务还行，前台还算有求必答的。补充点评2008年6月21日：早餐在25楼，花色很少，很是一般了。,"This time I stayed in a large bed, and the room facilities were okay, and I was not as old as they thought.The bathroom seemed to have been newly made, and it was quite clean and tidy.The service of the hotel is okay, and the front desk is still required to answer.Supplementary comment on June 21, 2008: Breakfast is on the 25th floor, there are very few colors, which is very general."
1,酒店位置很好，去火车站、机场、逛街都比较方便。设施什么的也很好。在这个位置这样的价格真是银不错了。如果不是正好有个工地在边上，应该会十会清静。服务员的态度也挺好，只是结账的时候因为不知是谁在服务指南内页上用原珠笔划了不到2厘米的一条线，查房的服务员反应十分过度的不让结账，说要赔偿，虽然最后经过交涉没有赔款，不过心里十分之不爽，下次入住前如不是要把房间检查个底朝天谁敢住进去。希望这次的经历也使酒店执行制度不会再过度僵化。除开这点不愉快，其实还是值得推荐的。,"The hotel location is very good. It is more convenient to go to the railway station, airport and shopping.The facilities are also very good.The price at this position is really silver.If it wasn't for a construction site, it would be quiet.The attitude of the waiter is also very good, but because I do n’t know who I do n’t know who in the inner page of the service guide, the original bead pen has a line of less than 2 cm.Although there was no compensation after the negotiations, it was very uncomfortable. If you do n’t have to check the room to check in the next time you check in, who dares to live in?It is hoped that this experience will also make the hotel execution system will not be overly rigid.Except for this unpleasantness, it is actually worth recommending."
1,环境不错，服务也很热心，我定的是一个豪华大床间，房间有点偏小，装修还说得过去，总之还是对得,The environment is good and the service is very enthusiastic. I set a luxurious large bed. The room is a bit small. The decoration is still over. In short
0,酒店服务比较差，除了前台的态度还可以以外。客房、餐厅的服务质量和态度都比较差，根本不能算3星的酒店。另外房间还是比较干净的。最郁闷的是没有早饭吃～～早上看完日出回酒店，去餐厅吃早饭被告知已经全部给订掉了。服务员还反过来问我们怎么没有预订，我们入住时根本没有人提醒我们。另外具我观察，大部分已经预订来吃早饭的不是本酒店住客。都是由导游带的一个一个团队从外面进来吃饭的。住客的利益何在～～。,"The hotel service is relatively poor, in addition to the attitude of the front desk.The service quality and attitude of rooms and restaurants are poor, and they cannot be considered a 3 -star hotel at all.In addition, the room is relatively clean.The most depressed thing is that I have no breakfast ~~ After watching the sun in the morning, I went back to the hotel and went to the restaurant for breakfast and was told that they had been booked.The waiter also asked us why we were not reserved. No one reminded us when we stayed.In addition, I have observed that most of the guests who have already booked for breakfast are not in this hotel.They came in from the outside one by one by the tour guide.What is the interests of the residents ~~."
0,房间设施质量不是很好，房间很大有20多平方，但感觉不温馨。酒店价格在当地来讲，不算实惠。,"The quality of the room facilities is not very good. The room is more than 20 square meters, but it feels not warm.The price of hotels is not affordable in the local area."
0,酒店设施较陈旧，我们入住的房间紧靠厨房的排烟道，躁声非常大，要求调换房间，酒店答复晚9：30分餐厅就休息，不会影响休息。可是早晨5-6时，餐厅做早餐再次影响休息，酒店采取此种推委隐瞒的做法太不象话了。,"The hotel facilities are older. The room we stayed in the kitchen was close to the flue. It was very irritable and asked to change the room. The hotel responded to the restaurant at 9:30 in the evening, which would not affect the rest.However, at 5-6 in the morning, the restaurant's breakfast would affect the rest again."
1,"昨天刚从南京回来,去之前经过反复比较后挑了晶丽感觉不管是门童、前台接待，或者是餐厅服务员都经过良好的训练，那位门童大叔还仔细介绍到夫子庙该怎么乘车（因为是下班高峰，出租车很难叫到）选的商务单人间，在顶楼11楼，虽然靠近马路，但还算安静","I just returned from Nanjing yesterday. After I went there, I picked Jingli after repeated comparisons. I felt that no matter whether it was a child, the front desk reception, or the restaurant waiters were well trained.(Because it is the peak of work, it is difficult to call taxis.) The business single room, on the 11th floor of the top floor, although it is close to the road, it is still quiet"
1,第二次去了总体来说不错厅和房间都够大床褥什么也挺干净的就是别墅的内装修比较旧了而且厅和厨房那边好多苍蝇可能是一楼外面都是草坪的关系吧觉得4x的标准的话这种二房和三房的房间还是比较实惠的顺便说下华美达离吃大闸蟹的地方也不远开车5分钟就到了由于在大上海高尔夫度假村里闲暇还能打打高尔夫练习场30块钱一盒球（30个球）租杆费15块,"For the second time, I went to general, the hall and the room were enough for the mattresses. The internal decoration of the villa is relatively old and the hall and the kitchen side may be the relationship between the first floor.If the 4X standard is the standard, this two -bedroom and three -bedroom rooms are still more affordable By the way, the place where Huameda eats hairy crabs not far from eating 5 minutes, and it is because it can play golf exercise field 30 in the Golf Resort in Greater Shanghai.A box of dollars (30 goals) 15 yuan for rent"
1,"房间满大的,我们预定的时候没有大床了,于是定的双标间,双标间的床有点小呢!!总的房间的设施满好,在海南算得上比较好的4星宾馆了呢!不过值得注意的是,他的标间每一间的大小不大一样,我们和同伴1共定的2间,2间的差别还是蛮大的呢!酒店离海滩比较近,过了马路,走个2-3分钟就到了,马路对面就是夏日百货,附近海鲜馆也很多吃饭也蛮方便,酒店里面也有餐馆,价格也不算太贵!不过值得注意的是服务是在是恐怖:1我们游完泳想再要2条干的浴巾等了1晚上都没有送来,2我们租用的麻将室,每次要等好久才有人来开门,最久等了30分钟,等算账的时候,2个小姐搬着手指头算了半天才把7:20-11:00的租用时间算成了4个小时40分钟,我们说了半天她们才弄对,晕死!3,我们在酒店3楼的一家湘菜馆吃饭,总共吃了291元,硬是给算成了380元!交涉了很久,酒店的经理居然要我们承担一部分损失,怎么可能!!!!最后打出5次账单才打对价格!我们真是服了海南人!!!!!补充点评2008年3月25日：对了,我们住的是4楼的别墅区,就在游泳池边上,不错的房间哦","The room is full, and there is no big bed when we book, so the dual -standard room, the dual -standard room bed is a bit small !! The total facilities in the total room are good.But it is worth noting that the size of each room in his standard is not the same. The difference between the two and the two rooms with our companions 1 is quite big! The hotel is closer to the beach.It took 2-3 minutes to take a 2-3 minutes. Opposite the road is summer department stores. There are many meals nearby seafood museums. There are also restaurants in the hotel, and the price is not too expensive! But it is worth noting that the service is horrible:1 We want to have two dry bath towels after swimming after swimming. After 1 night, we did not send it. 2 The mahjong room we rented. Every time we have to wait for a long time to open the door, wait for 30 minutes for the longest.The two ladies moved their fingers for a long time before the rental time of 7: 20-11: 00 was calculated for 4 hours and 40 minutes. We said that they were right for half a day and fainted! 3, we were on the 3rd floor of the hotel.A Hunan restaurant ate a total of 291 yuan, and it was calculated as 380 yuan! After a long negotiation, the hotel manager actually wanted us to bear some losses.We are really serving Hainan !!!!! Supplementary comment on March 25, 2008: By the way, we live in the villa area on the 4th floor, just on the swimming pool, a good room"
1,该酒店比较干净，环境也不错，就是房间比较少，当我第二次再预定的时候，就已经没房间了。,"The hotel is relatively clean and the environment is good, that is, the room is relatively small. When I re -book the second time, there is no room."
1,"我感觉在亚龙湾这个酒店还是不错的,性价比非常高,但我定的房间宽带需另外付费.餐厅的菜真是太贵了.没有办法整个亚龙湾都是这样,真的希望在附近能有些实惠的餐馆.","I feel that the hotel in Yalong Bay is still good, and the price is very high, but the broadband I set in the room needs to be paid separately. The restaurant's dishes are really expensive. There is no way to do this.Then, then"
1,房间虽小，但设施齐全，非常整洁。特别隔壁就是朗豪坊，购物、吃饭、看电影极其方便，不同楼层有适合不同年龄和消费群体的服饰、百货，应有尽有，称得上购物天堂。,"Although the room is small, the facilities are complete and very neat.Especially next door is Langhamfang. It is extremely convenient for shopping, eating, and watching movies. Different floors have clothing and department stores suitable for different ages and consumer groups."
1,"住的豪华海景房,在4楼,离电梯很远,房间非常好,家具很有特色,窗口望出去就是鼓浪屿,非常美,夜景更是好.地理位置没得说,下楼就是中山路,过马路就是轮渡站.虽然对着马路,不过房间有双层玻璃,所以基本没噪声.宾馆的隔音一般,有时能听到走廊里的声音.早餐很一般,品种较少.不过总的来说,性价比很高.","The luxurious sea view room where you live is on the 4th floor, far from the elevator, the room is very good, the furniture is very distinctive, the window is looking out is Gulangyu, it is very beautiful, the night view is better.Crossing the road is the ferry station. Although facing the road, there are double -layer glass in the room, so there is basically no noise. The sound insulation of the hotel is average, and sometimes the sound in the corridor can be heard. Breakfast is very average, there are fewer varieties., The cost performance is very high."
1,7.15日入住，7.16日离岛。观海木楼分上下两层，下层看不看得到海，不知道。我通过携程定时，要求住上层，房间格局构造都不错，从落地窗可以看到海，我们住的楼下就有游泳池，浪漫惬意。岛上不大但，走走也是挺累的，特别是在大太阳地下.....去那里的朋友以下需要注意：中午十二点退房，加上40分钟打打扫时间，所以早上去的朋友，只能在大厅寄放行李，然后去岛上走走（貌似大部分安排上岛都在早上）观海木楼因为是木质结构，以木为材料，所以在木材外面涂了东西，衣物皮肤等尽量不要靠近，在房间内也有标示。隔音效果的确很差，这跟建筑材料有关。我家那位身材非常壮硕，走在地板上能感觉到微震，不过楼下的一家四口也没有提意见，我想这楼还是很牢的。从外面进房间，大家走慢点，也看着点，因为小动物会在一开门的一刹那，咻的一下隐没（夸张描写，不过它们速度是很快，起码我没看出那是什么）再也不出现。人在房间的时候，是看不到它们的。我家那位睡了一晚，第二天背变开始痒，我不奇怪，他本是敏感皮肤，我就一点事情都没有，不过的确床单没有仙人掌酒店睡的舒服，有细微粉末的感觉，建议酒店改进。热水不是全天供应，晚五点左右到十点左右吧，记得不是很清楚了，也许每个季节会不一样吧。楼下的泳池底部是石头铺的，在亚龙湾仙人掌酒店的泳池泡过三天的我，乍一下水，还有些不适应，不过意境很好。推荐情侣晚上去哦！岛上的情人湾情人桥的，个人觉得没什么意思，经营者开发的景点而已。本想看日出，可惜早上下了场大雨，只好作罢。岛上有些地方还在建设中.....看样子应该是鸟园和旅社吧。饮食的话，在中餐厅吃的早餐，没什么好评价的，一般般。在西餐厅吃的晚餐，靠窗就是海，不错不错，就是要无视偶尔飞爬过的蚊虫蚂蚁（夏天么，岛上生态环境好，么办法）价格不便宜也不贵。P.S.回沪后证实，我家那位背部手臂腿部痒，为虫咬，是床单还是其他就不得而知了，奇怪的是，脸没有被咬......补充点评2008年7月29日：补充一下，岛上地图不是特别人性化。地图标有景点，大厅，饮食场所，泳池，住宿地点。乍一看不错，很清晰。可是，没有标出通往住宿地点的非主干道。也就是说，地图只有主干道，没有标明其他路。事情如下：我们在西餐厅吃完后，不打算通过电瓶车回去。便打算走回去，走到大厅附近天已经黑了，我们愕然发现地图上只标明观海木楼在大厅的那个方向，而面对眼前的几条上山的路，还真不知从那条开始好（大家不要惊慌，遇到此事致电大厅，会有电瓶车来接你们的）夜幕中的树林，寻找回家之路的情侣们凭着记忆，十五分钟后取得胜利（事实证明大自然白天和晚上是不一样的，多亏了游泳池。）建议酒店改进，估计更换更改地图成本比较高，可以选择增加标识牌。在通往住宿的地方，地图上未出现的路和路口，增加木质标识牌，上写地点和箭头即可。（字大写，位置明显些）,"Stay on 7.5, leave the island on 7.16.Watching the sea building is divided into two floors on the upper and lower floors. The lower floor cannot see the sea and does not know.When I was settled through Ctrip, I asked to live in the upper floor. The structure of the room was good. From the floor -to -ceiling window, we can see the sea. There is a swimming pool downstairs.The island is not big, but it is also very tired to walk, especially in the underground of the big sun ..... Friends who go there, you need to pay attention to: check out at 12 noon, plus 40 minutes of cleaning time, so go in the morning to go in the morningFriends, you can only store your luggage in the lobby, and then go to the island to walk on the island (it seems that most of the arrangements are arranged to go to the island in the morning) Watching the sea and wooden tower. Because it is wooden structure, wood is made of wood, so it was applied outside the wood.Try not to approach the skin, there are also labels in the room.The sound insulation effect is really poor, which is related to building materials.My family is very strong, and I can feel a slight shock when walking on the floor, but the family of four downstairs has no opinion. I think this building is still very firm.Enter the room from the outside, everyone walks slow down, and look at it, because the small animals will be at the moment when the door is opened, and the hiddenness is not (exaggerated, but they are fast, at least I have not seen what it is)No.When people are in the room, they can't see them.My family has slept for one night, and the back of my back is itching the next day. I am not surprised. He is a sensitive skin, and I have nothing to do at all, but there is indeed the bed sheet without a fairy -handed hotel to sleep comfortably.Hotel improvement.Hot water is not supplied throughout the day, about 5 o'clock in the evening to about 10 o'clock. Remember not to be very clear. Maybe each season will be different.At the bottom of the swimming pool downstairs, I was paved with stones. I was soaked in the pool of the Shilong Bay Fairy Hotel for three days. At first glance, I was a bit uncomfortable, but the artistic conception was very good.Recommend couples to go at night!The island's Lover's Bay Lover Bridge, I personally feel that it is not interesting, and the attractions developed by the operator.I wanted to watch the sunrise, but unfortunately he had a heavy rain in the morning and had to give up.Some places on the island are still under construction ... It seems that it should be a bird garden and a hostel.If you eat, breakfast you eat in Chinese restaurants, there is nothing to evaluate, generally.The dinner you eat in the western restaurant is the sea. It is good and good. It is to ignore the mosquito ants that occasionally crawling.After returning to Shanghai, P.S. confirmed that my back's arms and legs itchy, bite for insects, or others, or others, it is unknown. Strangely, my face was not bitten ...Day: Add it, the map on the island is not particularly humane.The icon has attractions, halls, diet places, swimming pools, accommodation sites.At first glance, it looks good and very clear.However, the non -main road leading to the accommodation location was not marked.In other words, the map only has the main road and does not indicate other roads.The matter is as follows: After we finished eating in the western restaurant, we did not intend to go back through a battery car.Then I planned to go back, and the sky was hacking near the hall. We suddenly found that only the direction of the Guan Haimu building in the lobby on the map, and facing the road in front of me, I really do n’t know from that one.(Don't panic, call the hall when you encounter this incident, there will be battery cars to pick you up.) The woods in the night, the couples looking for the road home, with their memory, won the victory fifteen minutes later (the facts prove that nature is during the day and the day andIt is different at night. Thanks to the swimming pool.) It is recommended that the hotel improvement. It is estimated that the change in changing the map is relatively high. You can choose to increase the identification sign.At the place to the accommodation, the roads and intersections that have not appeared on the map will increase the wooden identification sign, and write the location and arrow.(Word capital, obvious location)"

0,"中银大酒店地处站前西路（火车站附近）,自驾车也比较好找。但酒店房间较旧，豪华标准间也不怎么样，单人床不足1米2（就1米吧），感觉该装修了。酒店停车免费，送的自助早餐还不错，品种较多。酒店周围餐馆较多，有间人民公社的餐馆人很多、很旺。从酒店去岳阳楼开车不远，挺方便，但从岳阳楼回来注意有段是单行线。","BOC Hotel is located on the front West Road (near the railway station), and it is better to find self -driving.However, the hotel room is old and the luxury standard room is not good. The single bed is less than 1 meter 2 (just 1 meter). It feels that it should be decorated.The hotel parking is free, the buffet breakfast is good, and there are many varieties.There are many restaurants around the hotel, and there are many restaurants in the people's commune and very prosperous.It is not far from the hotel to drive from the Yueyang Tower, which is very convenient, but when you come back from Yueyang Tower, you should pay attention to that there is a single line."

1,很满意。三星的价钱，四星的设施。房间免费上网很方便。唯一不好就是床有点硬，被子也不是太舒服。一楼的餐厅晚上关门太早，17楼的餐厅太贵。不过总体上还是挺满意。准备以后出差到临沂都住这。,"very satisfied.Samsung's price, four -star facilities.The room is free to access the Internet for free.The only bad is that the bed is a bit hard, and the quilt is not too comfortable.The restaurant on the first floor was closed too early at night, and the restaurant on the 17th floor was too expensive.But overall is still very satisfied.After preparing for a business trip, I live in Linyi."
1,帮一位老外客户订的，环境不错，值得推荐，住的是豪华房，只是价格太高，希望携程能与酒店再谈下价，更再便宜就好了，客户说下次还会来住！,"Help a foreigner client, the environment is good, it is worth recommending. It is a luxury house, but the price is too high. I hope that Ctrip can talk about the next price with the hotel, and it will be cheaper.Intersection"
1,房间：建筑风格比较独特。木屋矗立在随潮汐涨落的水中，围廊象迷宫一样。看着自己的小屋，却没有直线的围廊可以走过去。对于房间的设施，不要期望过高。太阳能的淋浴有时候确实是无法让人洗上热水澡的。岛上的饮食不是特别方便，建议在上岛前，务必要把能带的吃的都带上。环境：岛不是很大。估计半天就能转过来。因为阴天，我分不清东南西北，反正，五彩滩那里的落日非常漂亮。蚊虫很多，如果带着孩子，一定要做好防蚊准备。海滩：海岸的长度不是很长。海水不是很干净。要去海岛上玩的话，一定要选择在那里住下，因为转天一早可以在退潮的海滩上，享受捉螃蟹、钓鱼、捉爬爬虾、捡螺的乐趣。这几天，我会发一些照片上来。希望能给后来的人，一些有用的参考。,"Room: The architectural style is relatively unique.The wooden house stands in the water that rises with the tide, like a maze.Looking at your hut, there is no straight -line gallery to walk over.Do not expect too high for the facilities of the room.The solar shower sometimes cannot make people take a hot bath.The diet on the island is not particularly convenient. It is recommended to bring all those who can eat before going to the island.Environment: The island is not very large.It is estimated that it can be turned in half a day.Because of cloudy days, I can't distinguish between the southeast and northwest. Anyway, the sunset in the colorful beach is very beautiful.There are many mosquitoes. If you bring your child, you must prepare mosquito prevention.Beach: The length of the coast is not very long.Sea water is not very clean.If you want to go to the island, you must choose to live there, because you can enjoy the fun of catching crabs, fishing, climbing shrimp, and snails on the ebb beach early in the morning.These days, I will post some photos.Hope to be used to those who later, some useful references."
1,我是在海洋公园玩了一天，带着疲劳的身体在金钟打的到酒店的，原来以为打的会很贵，其实也不是很贵，因为来之前就打电话问过前台的小姐，从金钟怎么到酒店。前台告诉我坐5B就能到，结果是我在金钟下了车之后，不知道在哪里找到可以坐5B的车站，所以一狠心，就打的了，也就是27元港币就可以到酒店了。到达酒店，前台的小姐语气温和，速度也还挺快的，当一切手续办好之后，轻声地告诉我：已帮你升级到行政房。那一刻心里面是狂喜。上到房间，里面还不错，虽然不是很大，但也没有想像中的小（因为之前已经去过香港几次，再小的我们也住过）窗外就是民居，也能看到海。洗手间也还挺干净。放好行李，马上下楼去找吃的，附近还有几家没关门的小店，十元一碗的云吞面在香港来说是低消费。味道也还可以。白天再下去看的时候，原来那条街是个菜市场，作为一个主妇，顺道也对比了一下价钱。才发现，原来我们的物价真的是太高了。有些东西居然和我们的是一样价钱。但，人家的收入是我们的N倍。不说了。总体来说，这家酒店，从各方面来说还行。不次如果有机会去香港的话，我也还会选择这一家酒店。不过就是觉得酒店的价格偏高了一点点（HK715）。或许是暑假的原因吧，如果平时去可能会低一点吧。而且每天的价格不一样，有点像海鲜价。,"I played in the Ocean Park for a day, and I went to the hotel with a fatigue body at Golden Bell. I thought it would be expensive, but it was not very expensive, because I called the lady on the front desk before I came.How to get to the hotel.The front desk told me that I could get in 5B. As a result, after I got out of the car at Jinzhong, I did n’t know where to find a station that could take 5B, so when I was cruel, I played it.EssenceWhen I arrived at the hotel, the Miss at the front desk was also very fast. When all the procedures were completed, I told me softly: I have helped you upgrade to the administrative house.At that moment, there was ecstasy in my heart.Going up to the room, it is not bad. Although it is not very large, it is not as small as I expected (because I have been to Hong Kong several times before, and we have lived in the small) window, and we can see the sea.The toilet is quite clean.Put your luggage and go downstairs to find it. There are still several small shops nearby. The ten -dollar wonton noodles are low consumption in Hong Kong.The taste is okay.When I went down during the day, it turned out that the street was a vegetable market. As a housewife, the price also compared the price.Only found that our price was really too high.Some things are the same price as us.However, the income of others is our N times.Don't say it.Overall, this hotel is OK in all aspects.If you have a chance to go to Hong Kong, I will also choose this hotel.But I just think the price of the hotel is a little higher (HK715).Maybe it's the reason for the summer vacation. It may be lower if you go to usual.And the daily price is different, a bit like seafood price."
0,"我订的是普通标准间B,感觉非常的糟糕.尤其是淋浴房没设计好,洗完澡之后水流的一地都是,第二天都没干,严重影响心情,本来计划住二天,无奈第二天早上退房了.","I booked a normal standard room B, and it feels very bad. Especially the shower room is not designed, and the water flows after taking a shower. I didn’t do it the next day.The next morning, check out."
1,海底世界酒店整体环境不错，一个很雅致的庭院，比较安静，且在亚龙湾算是个相对便宜的酒店，我住的是豪华单人间，2米的大床，房间也很宽敞，还有个阳台，与环球城酒店紧挨着，服务也挺好，由于没有电梯，入住及离开时都是服务人员主动帮忙搬运行李，态度很好，只有一点不太满意，就是酒店提供的海底世界半潜观光船游览买一送一服务，我是想和老人及一个不满三岁的孩子去看，前台告诉我孩子可以免费，但去买票时小孩还需半价100元，感觉不值就放弃了。,"The overall environment of the hotel in the Underwater World is good. A very elegant courtyard is relatively quiet, and it is a relatively cheap hotel in Yalong Bay. I live in a luxury single room, 2 meters of large beds, and the room is also spacious. There is also a balcony.The service with the Global City Hotel is also very good. Because there are no elevators, the service staff actively help carry their luggage when they stay and leave. The attitude is very good. Only one is not very satisfied.To buy one get one free service, I want to go to see the old man and a child under three years old. The front desk tells me that the child can be free, but the child needs to be half price at half price when buying a ticket. It feels worthless."
1,带阳台的房间很好，窗外的自然景色，有山有水有云雾，很舒服。宽带的速度相当快，儿子打游戏直喊爽。就是餐厅服务欠缺，建议外出用餐。,"The room with a balcony is very good. The natural scenery outside the window has mountains, water and clouds, and it is very comfortable.The speed of the broadband is quite fast, and the son shouted directly.It is the lack of restaurant services. It is recommended to go out for dining."
0,"总体来讲,非常失望。完全不值我们付的房费，比起房价更便宜的如家/速8等差很多。希望携程对酒店情况要认真了解后再推荐。1）房间面积不小，床铺等尚可。但令人惊讶的是，宽带接口在床头下面，需要把床拖出来才能够到，最后我只能把电脑放在床头柜上，自己坐在地上上网。这是我第一次碰到这样的情况。2）卫生间非常陈旧，更可气的是，毛巾已经破成毛须边了居然还挂在那。3）早餐真的很差，品种异常的少，普通的煮鸡蛋还是服务员在那每人发一个！！！而且我们8点去的时候，所有桌子上都是乱七八糟的，还没及时清理。这样的早餐吃的让人恶心。难怪看其他点评也提到早餐问题。下次不会再住这家酒店了。","Overall, very disappointed.It is not worthy of the house fee we pay, which is much worse than home/speed 8, which is cheaper than house prices.I hope that Ctrip should be recommended after careful understanding of the hotel's situation.1) The room area is not small, and the beds are acceptable.But surprisingly, the broadband interface is under the bedside, and the bed needs to be dragged out. In the end, I can only put the computer on the bedside table and sit on the ground to surf the Internet.This is the first time I have encountered this situation.2) The bathroom is very old. What's even more angry is that the towel has been broken into the hair and is still hanging there.3) Breakfast is really poor, and there are very few varieties. Ordinary cooking eggs or waiters send one in each of them!IntersectionIntersectionAnd when we went at 8 o'clock, all the tables were messy and had not been cleaned in time.It is disgusting for such breakfast.No wonder you also mentioned breakfast problems when you look at other comments.I won't live in this hotel next time."
0,这几次入住感觉不如以前了，服务质量在下降，原来房价含早的，现在早餐也不送了，原来餐厅就餐感觉很不错，现在明显上菜的份量比以前少了很多，下次再去南通考虑换一家试试了,"It feels not as good as before, the quality of service is declining, and the original house prices are early. Now the breakfast is not delivered. The meal of the restaurant feels very good. Now it is obviously much less than before.Nantong considered changing a family"
0,从携程订房无数，唯独这家实在不感恭维。从走廊就开始一股酶味，房间也是。而且窗户是封死的。最可恶的是明明订的房间含两份早餐，前台只给一份的餐券，还说要另一份的话要就餐者拿身份证来登记。我靠，中国什么时候兴吃饭也要身份证了。我花了两份的钱，凭什么只给我一份。我的另一份，我把餐券撕了扔了，关别人什么事。此宾馆实在霸道，以后离之远点。,"There are countless reservations from Ctrip.From the corridor, an enzyme flavor is started, as is the room.And the window is sealed.The most abominable thing is that the room that is clearly ordered to include two breakfast. The front desk has only one meal coupon. It is also said that if you want another one, the diners will register with the ID card.I rely on when China has to eat for dinner.I spent two copies of money, why did I give me only one copy.In my other share, I threw the dining coupon, and what was the matter of others.This hotel is really overbearing, far away from the future."
1,该楼是目前乌鲁木齐标志建筑.交通位置非常突出.出行非常方便.周边环境非常好.红山.人民公园近在咫尺.二道桥仅四站路.非常好.有缘下次仍入住............,The building is currently the Urumqi logo building. The traffic location is very prominent.

1,游泳池的水很冷，小孩子被冻的发抖，不知为何？,"The water in the swimming pool is very cold, and the children are shaking by frozen. I don't know why?"
1,酒店就在海月广场，且酒店大门口就是椰梦长廊，风景秀丽，并随时可以下海游泳，交通非常便利，整个酒店的环境也很不错，是度假的好酒店，二楼还有小泳池，晚上坐在泳池边的椅子上，吹着海风，看着漂亮的夜景，听着海月广场上传来的阵阵欢快的音乐，真是舒畅极了。胆子大的朋友也可以在晚上去海里小游一下，或许在海滩边散步，放孔明灯，都是非常浪漫的。,"The hotel is at Haiyue Plaza, and the hotel gate is the Coconut Dream Corridor. The scenery is beautiful and can go to the sea at any time. The transportation is very convenient. The environment of the entire hotel is also very good. It is a good hotel for vacation., Sitting on the chair by the pool at night, blowing the sea breeze, watching the beautiful night view, listening to the cheerful music uploaded on Haiyue Plaza, it was really comfortable.Friends who are brave can also travel to the sea at night. Perhaps walking on the beach and putting hole lights are very romantic."
0,"携程的客服人员告诉我预订的是离火车站一公里的店,不知道怎么变成这家离火车站3公里的店,住的房间不是主楼,而是后面像农村住宅区一样的房间一楼.前台告诉我住那里可以比较安静,结果发现被忽悠了,挨着窗就是一个学校,那读书声,下课声怎么也不像前台说的安静才住那幢楼,真不知道,前台说的主楼靠马路会更吵,会是吵到什么程度.问酒店像熨斗,前台告知只有一个,借出去了.我说协调一下,让我先用一下,前台马上说,那客人出去了,像是他自己借的一样,客人在不在房间,都不用问一下,就告诉我客人出去了,呵呵,给人感觉像假的样子.严重的问题是,房间的水,我喝了几杯后发现写的日期是3月7日,有效期是15日,而我去的时候,已是24日,让前台换一下水,我是晚上10点打的电话,到10点45分左右才送来,让客人在房间等了如此之久.奇怪的是,送水的人还告诉我那上面写的日期是不准的,奇怪,不准的,你如家还特意贴个字条上去做什么?第二天取一下寄存行李,在前台等了十分钟才办完手续.总体感觉:这两年如家店增加不少,但是内地的如家店的整体水平需要提高的太多了.","Ctrip's customer service staff told me to book a shop one kilometer from the railway station. I don't know how to become a shop 3 kilometers from the railway station.. The front desk tells me that I can live there to be quiet there, but I found that I was fooled. It was a school next to the window. The sound of reading, how can I live in the building like the front desk said. I don’t know. I don’t know.The main building will be more noisy on the road, to what extent it will be. Ask the hotel like an iron, there is only one front desk, borrow it out. I said to be coordinated, let me use it first.He borrowed it by himself. The guests didn't have to ask in the room. They didn't have to ask, so they told me that the guests went out. Hehe, it felt like a false appearance. The serious problem was that the water in the room, after drinking a few glasses, I found that I wrote to write after writing a few drinks.The date is March 7, and the validity period is 15 days. When I go, it is 24 days. Let the front desk change the water. I call at 10:00 pm.The guests waited for such a long time in the room. Strangely, the person who delivered the water also told me that the date written on it was inaccurate, strange, inaccurate, what do you specifically posted a note to make?When you storage your luggage, you have waited for ten minutes at the front desk to complete the procedure. Generally, it feels: In the past two years, it has increased a lot in home stores, but the overall level of the home shop in the Mainland needs to be improved too much."
1,环境不错。不过离泰山还是有段距离。要是能包含早餐就好了。,The environment is good.But there is still a distance from Taishan.If you can include breakfast.
1,可以看到乌山和于山，风景不错，环境不错，服务也还可以。,"You can see Wushan and Yu Shan. The scenery is good, the environment is good, and the service is okay."

1,住宿环境还是不错的，比较干净。前台的服务态度很好，一个小伙子，我们说想k歌，就带我们过去看房间，还告诉我怎么吃饭比较方便。说起吃饭，我建议就在酒店的餐厅吃，比外面所谓的美食街贵不了多少，我是有切身感受的。还有就是自驾的，我最想不通的就是自己开车去住店，居然收我20元停车费，这个简直太没有道理了，有点想钱想疯的感觉！！！,"The accommodation environment is still good and clean.The service attitude of the front desk is very good.

1,"在嘉兴这样的小城能有这么舒适的酒店真的很意外,首先要赞的是他家的床,很舒服软硬适中,其次是浴室,酒店的管理者很细心连浴盐都准备好了,让走了一天的我好好泡了一个澡,最重要的是早餐很丰富,菜肴都很可口,服务员的态度和深圳5星级酒店有得比,下次去还住那里.",It is really surprising to have such a comfortable hotel like a small city like Jiaxing.Let me take a bath for a day. The most important thing is that the breakfast is rich and the dishes are very delicious. The attitude of the waiter is comparable to the 5 -star hotel in Shenzhen. I will live there next time.
1,漯河当地人称这里是漯河最高档的酒店。房间很新，很豪华。早餐一般，不够丰富。网络比较差，经常没有反应。地理位置在漯河的东郊，偏得厉害，不过漯河很小，打车20从这头到那头足够了。晚上出名对面黑洞洞的体育中心，左面黑漆漆的国道，右面黑漆漆的空地，很是渗人。附近没有什么吃饭的地方。,"Local people in Luohe said this is the highest -end hotel in Luohe.The room is new and luxurious.Breakfast is average, not rich enough.The network is relatively poor and often does not respond.The geographical location is on the eastern suburbs of Luohe, which is very powerful, but the Luohe is very small, and it is enough to take a taxi from this to that.In the evening, the sports center of the black hole opposite, the black national road on the left, and the dark open space on the right are very infiltrated.There is no place to eat nearby."
1,总的来说是不错的酒店！！但还有一些小细节要注意，电脑宽带接线处的板已坏，早餐送房后在蛋饼里发现锅底灰。。经交涉后店方马上来电致歉（这点非常满意，但希望在下次入住不要再发生此类事件）！！下次去成都还会继续入住喜来登,"Overall is a good hotel!IntersectionHowever, there are some small details to note that the board at the computer broadband wiring is bad.

1,很实惠，就是不灵活安排。希望能更加进步，下次去还到这里。,"Very affordable, but not flexibly arranged.I hope it can be more advanced, and I will come here next time."
1,酒店的硬件还是相当不错的。房间很大，床也很大。比较舒适。晚上在浦东滨江大道上喝咖啡，从浦东望向浦西，中福世福汇楼汇的皇冠形的灯饰非常惹眼。车在延安路高桥上从机场方向开来时，也能远望到酒店的楼顶灯饰。酒店的大堂与其档次相比显得有些不够敞亮，感觉拘谨。补充点评2006年8月27日：还有比较差的是门童的服务与其档次相比不可同日而语，没有眼色。出门打的时，去叫停在酒店门台上的出租，司机挑地方，一听比较近就不去了。只好自已跑到路边打的，门童视而不见，令人感觉气愤。我就怎么也明白，酒店允许出租停在自已门口，到底是出租为客人服务呢，还是酒店的存在是为了出租司机服务呢。同样在上海另外一家同档次的酒店，客人都很有次序在酒店门口排立，几个门童前后跑到马路上拦出租并指引车停在客人排队之处，恭候客人上车。所以说服务的软件和管理还是,"The hardware of the hotel is quite good.The room is large and the bed is large.More comfortable.In the evening, I drank coffee on Pudong Binjiang Avenue and looked at Puxi from Pudong.When the car comes from the airport on the Gaoqiao of Yan'an Road, you can also look at the roof lighting of the hotel.The lobby of the hotel looks a bit bright compared to its grade, and it feels restrained.Supplementary comment on August 27, 2006: There is still a worse service that the service of the door is incomparable compared to its grade, and there is no wink.When I went out, I went to rent on the hotel door. The driver picked the place, and it would not go to it as soon as he heard it.I had to run to the roadside, and I didn't see it, and I felt angry.I also understand how the hotel allows rental to stop at my door. Is it renting for guests, or is the hotel's existence for renting a driver service.Also in another hotel in Shanghai, the guests were very orderly to stand at the door of the hotel. Several children ran to the road to stop renting and guided the car to stop at the guests' queue and wait for the guests to get on the bus.So the software and management of the service is still"
1,预定时声明要无烟楼层，网站回复也确认是无烟楼层但没有大床房，就接受了双床房。但是下午五点多到达入住时竟然改成吸烟楼层大床房，明显是把我预定的房间给了别人！一再强调入住的是正处在妊娠反应期孕妇，需要无烟环境，贵宾楼那个脸从头到尾拉得很长的男前台无动于衷，敷衍了事地说了句无烟房间住的都是一个月前入住的老客户了。那携程给我的确认信是凭什么发出来的？更可气的是，下午5点多了，房间还没打扫完！让客人干等了大半小时！中餐厅的服务员们态度还不错，不过点的东西吃下去的不到五分之一，胃口不太好。,"During the predetermined, the smoke -free floor is stated. The website response also confirmed that it was a smoke -free floor but there was no large bed room.But when I arrived at 5 pm, I changed to a large bed room in a smoking floor when I was in my check -in.

1,这个五星应该不是现在评定的，大概是祖上传下来的。从任何一个方面来讲，都不是五星的水准，难怪价格实惠！两点：房间的卫生有待提高，地毯上总有些毛绒绒的东西，小孩子在地上一爬，身上就会沾到一些。住了两晚，离店后，老婆和孩子身上都发疹子，实在想不出接触过什么过敏源，估计是酒店的地毯上的东西。另外，离店时忘了一件物品在房间，酒店代为保管了，但一直不通知本人，不知何故。直到本人半个月后遍寻不着，抱着一丝希望打电话去询问，那才叫惊喜万分！五星的服务，差得很远。旅游团队很多，早餐拥挤，低楼层恐怕会比较嘈杂。周围还是很方便的，对面的小路走进去不远，有一家过桥米线店，斜对面有一条横马路，有很多小餐馆，味道不错，价格也实惠。补充点评2008年6月12日：通过携程预定的，联系方式在携程的订单上总应该有吧！如果没有，那是携程的不对。我5月12日作出点评，5月13日下午1点收到携程发出的短信通知，说是酒店方面通知我有物品遗忘在房间。这是否巧合，明眼人一看便知。现在服务业的态度都很好，值得肯定，但都是虚心接受，屡教不改。希望贵酒店真正能做到有则改之，无则加勉。宾馆反馈2008年5月16日：感谢您的意见。酒店于1997年12月正式营业，于2000年12月正式挂牌五星。先后于2004年6月，2007年11月分别进行过部分楼层的装修。也核查过您所住过的房间，为近期新装修的房间，地毯还存在表面浮毛脱落的现象。酒店会加大清理工作，减少和避免此类情况产生。有关遗忘在酒店房间内的物品，酒店过去是根据遗留物品的价值和文件的重要性，通过订房渠道找寻客人电话来联系转交。由于每天会有客人遗留类似杂志，使用过的洗漱用品等，如果订单上没有联系方式，通常采用保留一段时间，等客人找寻的方式处理。对于您在房间遗留的易拉宝，没有引起足够的重视。酒店已经重新修订客人遗留物品处理程序，由当天的大堂副理和管家部主管再次认定通知处理，并针对散客在入住时，征询客人意见，留下联系电话等方式，尽量保证为此类客人及时作出有效沟通。期待您的再次光临。,"This five -star should not be rated now, probably the ancestor uploaded.From any aspect, it is not the level of five -star. No wonder the price is affordable!Two points: The hygiene of the room needs to be improved. There are always plush things on the carpet, and the children climb on the ground, and they will get some.After staying for two nights, after leaving the shop, his wife and children had rashes. I couldn't think of any allergies that had been exposed to.In addition, when I left the store, I forgot that an item was in the room.It wasn't until I couldn't find it half a month later, holding a hint of hopes to call to ask, that was a surprise!The five -star service is far away.There are many tourism teams, breakfast is crowded, and low floors may be more noisy.It is still very convenient. The opposite path is not far from the road. There is a bridge -noodle shop. There is a horizontal road on the opposite side. There are many small restaurants. It tastes good and the price is affordable.Supplementary comment on June 12, 2008: Through Ctrip's scheduled, contact information should always be on Ctrip's orders!If not, it was the wrong of Ctrip.I made a comment on May 12th, and received a text message from Ctrip from 1 pm on May 13th, saying that the hotel notified me to forget the items in the room.Is this coincidental?Nowadays, the attitude of the service industry is very good, it is worthy of recognition, but they are all accepted with an open mind.It is hoped that the expensive hotel can really change it.Hotel feedback on May 16, 2008: Thank you for your opinion.The hotel was officially opened in December 1997 and was officially listed in five stars in December 2000.In June 2004, some floors were decorated in November 2007.It has also been checked that the room you have lived. For the newly renovated rooms in the near future, the carpet still has the phenomenon of surface floating hair.Hotels will increase cleanup to reduce and avoid such situations.Regarding the items that forgotten in the hotel room, the hotel used to find guest calls to contact by the reservation channel based on the value and importance of the documents in the reserved items.Due to every day, there will be a magazine left by guests and the use of washing products that have been used. If there is no contact information on the order, it is usually retained for a period of time, waiting for the guests to find it.It does not attract enough attention to Yilabao left in the room.The hotel has re -revised the processing procedures left by the guests. The deputy manager and the head of the housekeeper department of the day once again identified the notice processing, and in accordance with the guests' opinions, leaving a contact phone number, etc., try to ensure that such guests are guaranteed to be as much as possible.Make effective communication in time.welcome next time."
0,"我端午节期间带家人入住了一晚，感觉服务比较差，根本达不到四星的标准，下面我从硬件和服务两方面做一个点评：一、硬件1、酒店位置不错，比较繁华；夜间很安静(我入住的是东楼)；2、酒店房间很小(特别是卫生间)，和香港的酒店有得一拼；3、房间衣柜没有门把手，打开很费劲；4、席梦思床垫很软(好的席梦思应该比较硬)；5、房间隔音不好，我入住的当晚，隔壁是间婚房，很多人在闹房，声音很清楚；二、服务1、房间里没有准备牙刷，我拨打分机16要求提供，接线员竟然让我拨打其他电话去要(酒店入住卡上清楚写明有要求直接拨打16就可以了)；2、去二楼中餐厅就餐，服务员告知中餐厅当天搬到一楼鲍翅馆了；转到一楼鲍翅馆，服务员给了一份鲍翅馆的菜单，我问服务员要中餐厅菜单，这个服务员竟然说没有，我问道，中餐厅都搬到一楼了，难道菜单没搬下来么？这时服务员才不情愿的把中餐厅的菜单给我；3、因为是通过携程预定的，送了20元积分卡。在就餐完毕后，我们把积分卡给服务员，由于这个服务员已经把帐单打印好，不想重新打印，竟然说你们下次再来用好了，我们是从外地过来的，下次不知是猴年马月了；4、第二天早上去吃早餐，由于小孩(16个月大)不肯吃早饭而哭闹，服务员竟然过来对我小孩说，再哭就打屁股了！这句话我们当父母的可以说，但是你们酒店服务员绝对不应该说，希望你们道歉！5、就餐完毕来去，走到餐厅门口时，服务员用眼睛瞟你一下，连招呼也不打。住了很多四星、五星，从来没见过这么没礼貌的。宾馆反馈2008年6月17日：对于您在住店期间发生的不愉快,我代表酒店真诚的向您道歉.非常感谢您对我们提出的意见和批评，我们也把您所反映的问题反馈到了相关部门，进行了培训和整改。我们希望能有机会再次会您提供服务，相信一定会让您有不同的感觉。","During my Dragon Boat Festival, I took my family to check in for one night. I felt that the service was relatively poor. I could not meet the standards of the four -star. I made a comment from the two aspects of hardware and service: 1. The hardware 1. The hotel's location is good and relatively prosperous. At nightVery quiet (I am in the East Tower); 2. The hotel room is small (especially the bathroom), and there is a fight with the hotel in Hong Kong; 3. The room wardrobe has no door handles, which is very hard to open;Soft (good Xi Mengsi should be relatively hard); 5. The room sound insulation is not good. On the night of my stay, there was a wedding room next door. Many people were in a noise room and the sound was very clear.Dialing the extension 16 request to provide it, and the worker even asked me to call other calls (the hotel's check -in card clearly states that there are requirements to directly dial 16); 2. Go to the second floor of the Chinese restaurant for dinner.Lou Pa Wings Pavilion; transferred to the Balto Wing Pavilion on the first floor, the waiter gave a menu for abalone wings. I asked the waiter who asked the Chinese restaurant menu. This waiter said no. I asked, the Chinese restaurant moved to the first floor to the first floor.Isn't the menu moved down?At this time, the waiter reluctantly gave me the menu of the Chinese restaurant; 3. Because it was booked through Ctrip, a 20 yuan points card was sent.After the dining, we gave the points card to the waiter. Since the waiter had printed the bill well and didn't want to print it again, it said that you will use it again next time. We come from the field.4. Go to breakfast the next morning. Because the child (16 months old) refused to eat breakfast and cried, the waiter came over and said to my child, and he cried again!We can say this sentence as parents, but your hotel waiter should never say, I hope you apologize!5. After the meal comes and go, when you walk to the door of the restaurant, the waiter shakes you with your eyes and does not even say hello.I have lived a lot of four -star and five -star, and I have never seen so politely.Hotel feedback on June 17, 2008: For the unpleasantness that you happened during the shop, I would like to apologize to you on behalf of the hotel. Thank you very much for your opinions and criticisms. We also feedback the problems you reflected to the relevant departments, Training and rectification.We hope to have the opportunity to provide you again, I believe it will make you feel different."
1,房间一般，洗手间却非常陈旧！环境还很幽静。,"The room is average, but the toilet room is very old!The environment is still quiet."
1,替朋友多次订过该酒店，挺不错的，唯一就是停车不方便，从青年大街进入停车场以及从停车场驶入青年大街都不太便利。,It is good to book the hotel many times for friends. The only thing is that parking is inconvenient. It is not convenient to enter the parking lot from the youth street and enter the Youth Street from the parking lot.
0,从重庆过来，机场下来已经是下午5点多了，结果房间没有打扫好，半小时OK，6点，还没有好，15分钟。晕！7点，还没有好，和总台交涉，“我也没有办法”，7点半才进房间。电梯上去走道黑啊。真不知4星怎么挂上去的？从来没有遇到这么差的4星酒店。强烈不推荐！！！,"From Chongqing, the airport was already over 5 pm. As a result, the room was not cleaned well. Half an hour was OK, 6 o'clock, not good, 15 minutes.faint!At 7 o'clock, it was not good yet, and negotiated with the main station, ""I can't help it"", only entered the room at 7:30.The elevator goes up and walks black.I really don't know how 4 stars hang up?I have never encountered such a 4 -star hotel.Strongly not recommended!IntersectionIntersection"
1,服务总体很好，通过房间电话可以方便得到服务，价格有一定竞争力。有一点遗憾：酒店处打车不是很方便；同时酒店取消了机场BUS，客人多少有些不方便。,"The service is generally good. It can be convenient to get the service through the room phone, and the price is competitive.There is a regret: It is not convenient to take a taxi at the hotel; at the same time, the hotel cancels the airport BUS, and it is somewhat inconvenient to guests."
1,酒店包三餐，从来没有碰到过！在酒店吃了午餐和晚餐，很不错，有鱼有肉，而且做的味道也很好！每天还送两瓶矿泉水和两听可口可乐，不值啥钱，但是心意可贵！楼层里还有报纸共取阅。服务人员的态度非常好也非常主动。早晨结帐一分钟不到就全办完了，堪称神速！实在想不到淮南还有这样好的酒店，比许多大城市的五星级的都要好，有机会再去淮南一定还去金茂去住！,"The hotel has three meals, and I have never encountered it!I have lunch and dinner at the hotel. It is very good. It has fish and meat, and it tastes good!Send two bottles of mineral water and listen to Coca -Cola every day.There are also newspapers in the floor.The attitude of the service staff is very good and active.After a minute of checkout in the morning, it will be done in less than a minute, which is a speedy!I really can't think that Huainan has such a good hotel, which is better than the five -star of many large cities. If you have the opportunity to go to Huainan, you must go to Jinmao to live!"

0,酒店员工态度超级恶劣。特别是前台。餐厅没有接待客人就坐。最气愤的是话还没说完就把电话挂了。劝大家最好是不要去，不然会被气死，交通又不方便，周围环境复杂。,"Hotel employees are super bad.Especially the front desk.The restaurant does not sit without receiving guests.The most angry thing is that before I finished speaking, I hung up the phone.It is best not to go, otherwise you will be killed, the traffic is inconvenient, and the surrounding environment is complicated."
1,"性价比还不错,288含早.比山下的所谓外资汤口宾馆好多了.汤口宾馆居然用餐还收10%的服务费.价高量少.强烈BS黄山脚下的饭店,宾馆.占据了好的地理位置斩人!!!!!!!","The price / performance ratio is not bad, 288 contains early. It is much better than the so -called foreign Soupkou Hotel under the mountain. The Tangkou Hotel actually receives a service fee of 10%. The price is high.

0,前几次入住此酒店的舒适感觉使我认为再去香港住这是必然的选择，现在看来现实真是太残酷了！！！-中午到达酒店办理入住手续时开始出问题：找不到入住的人名；好不容易找着了人名房型又不对，酒店前台服务员板着脸说是携程跟他们定房间时没有说明，不能调换房间，经过来来回回两个多小时的三方交涉，酒店给了我们一张免费的加床并说第二天给调换房间，后来就没人搭理我们了，结果是我们住了四天的加床，直到第五天时我们换了一家公司定房，酒店才给调了我们需要的房间，终于结束了这几天的加床之旅。酒店前台服务员态度生硬，房间的超迷你和以前住在这时有着鲜明的反差，这使我感受到了美好的东西也不是一成不变的，多一些其他的选择是应变的最好办法。,"The comfort of staying in this hotel a few times made me think it was an inevitable choice to go to Hong Kong. Now it seems that reality is really cruel!IntersectionIntersection-When arrived at the hotel at noon to go through the check -in procedures, I started to have a problem: I couldn't find the name of the person; it was difficult to find a famous house type.After two hours of back and forth, the three parties negotiated. The hotel gave us a free bed and said that the next day to change the room to change the room. Later, no one cared about us. As a result, we lived for four days.It was not until the fifth day we changed a company's fixed house that the hotel adjusted the room we needed, and finally ended the implantation journey in the past few days.The hotel's front desk waiter has a stiff attitude. The super mini -mini in the room has a clear contrast at this time. This makes me feel that the beautiful things are not unchanged. More other choices are the best way to respond."
1,带孩子入住只是希望能畅游迪士尼乐园（住客可以一次购票两天入园且中途可以自由出入），感觉还是值得的：整个园区景观幽雅，植被丰茂，各条园路均引人入胜，建议有时间可以四处走走。酒店环境不错，房间宽敞整洁，床很大，可以算作两张双人床；订的海景房，窗外远眺海湾，看渡轮往返，赏烟雨迷蒙，心旷神怡；晚餐自助餐尚可，早餐不敢恭维，孩子们如果喜欢与米奇合影，也可以尝试；建议下午六点左右回酒店到日落大道走走，海滨、晚霞、远山，值得期待。行李寄存和免费穿梭巴士很方便，入住时间下午三点，退房为上午十一时，但前后都可以免费寄存行李，不过乐园入口左侧也可以寄存，只是需要开包检查，麻烦。喜欢高球的朋友也可以到酒店后右侧早上挥几杆，我们是去游泳池享受了温水泡浴；泳池后还有个吧，看配制可以烧烤和表演，应当是晚上的节目，我们那天晚上下雨，没赶上。,"Take a child to stay in the Disneyland (residents can buy tickets for two days at a time and can enter and exit the parking in the middle). It feels worthwhile: the entire park is elegant, the vegetation is rich, and the roads are attracted. It is recommended to have time.You can walk around.The hotel environment is good, the room is spacious and clean, and the bed is very large, which can be counted as two double beds; the sea view room, overlooking the bay outside the window, watching the ferry back and forth, watching the smoke and rain, and the heart of heart and refreshed;If children like to take photos with Mickey, they can also try; it is recommended to return to the hotel around the hotel around 6 pm to walk around the sunset. The seaside, sunset, and distant mountains are worth looking forward to.Luggage storage and free shuttle buses are convenient. At 3 pm in check -in time, the check -up is 11 o'clock in the morning, but you can store your luggage for free before and after, but you can also store it on the left side of the park entrance.Friends who like high balls can also wave on the right side of the hotel on the right side of the hotel. We went to the swimming pool to enjoy a warm bubble bath; there is also one behind the swimming pool. It should be barbecue and performance to see the preparation.Rain, didn't catch up."
1,携程工作人员按照我的要求，给我介绍了这家酒店，我抱着试试看的心情，去住了一次，总体感觉还是非常不错的。我是一个非常注重干净整洁的一个人，也很在意细节，所以，住酒店我一直都有点担心，迫于工作性质，必须经常在外出差。很多我之前住过的酒店都不太理想，但是这家酒店还真是对胃口了。房间非常明亮大气，非常干净，我从服务员口中得知，这家酒店已经开了2年多了，但是床单、被套、毛巾都是崭新的，床非常大，柔软，有家的感觉。晚上开好夜床，床头柜上还放有糖果，很细致的服务。房间给人的感觉非常放松，空气也非常清新。房间里上网免费，很方便。入住时还送了一张免费的咖啡券，虽然没去喝，但是还是很高兴，能享受到如此周到的服务。房间里面的电视频道非常多，好多国家的台都有。早上退房前，我给前台打了电话，说需要退房，两分钟后，礼宾部的男孩子就到我的房间了，我非常吃惊。跟这位员工聊了几句，他是接到前台通知来帮我拿行李的。他说，只要他们不忙，会在第一时间赶到需要帮助的房间，帮助客人，听得我很感动。原来他们以为我打电话到前台是要寻求帮助的，想得太周到了。在办离店手续的时候，他们已经自动帮我叫好了出租车，可能在之前的谈话中，礼宾部的员工已经知道我要去机场了，太人性化了！我到机场也只花了18元钱，离机场真的很近，很方便的。不会耽误航班。,"According to my requirements, Ctrip staff introduced me to this hotel. I went to live with the mood of trying and seeing it. The overall feeling was very good.I am a person who pays great attention to cleanliness and cares about details. Therefore, I have always been a little worried about living in the hotel. I have to go out to go out often.Many hotels I have lived before are not ideal, but this hotel is really appetizing.The room was very bright and very clean. I learned from the waiter's mouth that the hotel has been opened for more than 2 years, but the sheets, quilts, and towels are brand new. The beds are very large, soft, and they feel at home.Open the night bed at night, and there are candy on the bedside table, which is very detailed.The room feels very relaxed and the air is very fresh.Free Internet access in the room, very convenient.I also gave a free coffee coupon during the check -in. Although I didn't drink, I was still very happy to enjoy such a thoughtful service.There are many TV channels in the room, and there are many countries.Before checking out in the morning, I called the front desk and said that I needed to check out. Two minutes later, the boys of the Libin department arrived in my room. I was very surprised.I talked with this employee a few words, he received a notice from the front desk to help me get my luggage.He said that as long as they are not busy, they will rush to the room that needs help in the first time to help guests, and I can hear me very moved.It turned out that they thought that I had to ask for help when I called the front desk, and I thought it was too thoughtful.During the procedures for the departure store, they have automatically applauded the taxi for me. In the previous conversation, the employees of the Libin Department already knew that I was going to the airport, which was too user -friendly!I only spent 18 yuan at the airport, which is really close to the airport and very convenient.Will not delay flights."

0,很旧，很破，很差，很贵，以后再不住了。订房还要信用卡担保，就是怕别人看到现场改变主意，太恶心了。前台都没有，很差,"Very old, very broken, poor, very expensive, I can't help it anymore in the future.Credit card guarantee is also required to book a house, which is to be afraid that others will see the scene change ideas.There is no front desk, very bad"

1,服务不是很专业，处理速度太慢。不过，因为服务员的小错误，副理亲自上来道歉，还是非常让人感动的。,"The service is not very professional and the processing speed is too slow.However, because of the small mistakes of the waiter, the deputy manager came up to apologize in person, which was very moving."
0,房间设施还可以，但酒店内非常的冷，冬天不推荐入住。,"The room facilities are okay, but the hotel is very cold, and it is not recommended to check in in winter."

0,感觉相当差劲，异味很大，性价比太低，绝不会再入住。,"It feels quite bad, the odor is very high, the price is too low, and you will never stay."
1,酒店软硬件都不错，游泳池更不错。只是周围没有吃饭的地方，一定到打车出去。另外，酒店不让出租车在酒店门口待客，客人要走到马路上打车，是法国人的新招吗？同酒店服务的档次严重脱位。,"The hotel software and hardware are good, and the swimming pool is even more good.It's just where there is no meal around, and you must go out for a taxi.In addition, the hotel does not allow taxis to treat guests at the door of the hotel. Is it a new trick for the guests to go to the road to take a taxi?The grade of hotel services is severely dislocated."
0,因为客户就在旁边一栋楼，所以就近住了，不过这个地方好象也就只要这么一个大点的宾馆吧，同事说好象是日本人开的,"Because the customer is just a building next to it, it is nearby, but this place seems to be as long as such a larger hotel. Colleagues say that it seems that it is opened by the Japanese."

1,只呆了一个晚上。酒店的设施和环境还算不错。离锦里也比较近。前台的小姐感觉不太热情，有点凶巴巴的，不知道是不是当时心情不好。值得一赞的是他的行李生态度很好，我有包裹需要由酒店帮忙快递出去，他们帮我跟进得很到位。表扬一下哦。,"Just stayed for one night.The hotel's facilities and environment are pretty good.It's closer to Jinli.The lady at the front desk was not very enthusiastic, a bit fierce, I don't know if she was in a bad mood at the time.It is worthy of praise that his luggage is very good. I have a package that needs to be courmed by the hotel. They help me in place.Praise it."
1,我虽然打分都挺高，但比以前差了，首先是床单不换了，再者早餐也比以前的差很多，基本上没有什么水果和蔬菜了，以前皮蛋瘦肉粥料很足，现在吃了一大碗也没有发现什么东东了。,"Although I have a high score, I am worse than before. First of all, the sheets are not changed. Besides, breakfast is much worse than before. Basically, there are no fruits and vegetables. Preserved eggs and lean meat porridge were sufficient.I didn't find anything in a large bowl."
1,其实在预定之前，看了各人的评论，有好有坏，结果我犹豫再三。入住了酒店后（豪华套房）就知道自己定对了酒店。酒店前台服务很周到，房间的设施也不错，个人觉得值得推荐。由于我经常有去市长大厦那边，感觉气势非常宏伟，所以就算订个普通房，也算是享受大环境。,"In fact, before the booking, after reading each person's comments, there were good or bad, but I hesitated again and again.After staying at the hotel (luxury suite), he knew that he had settled the hotel.The hotel's front desk service is very thoughtful, and the room facilities are also good. I personally think it is worth recommending.Because I often go to the mayor of the mayor, I feel that the momentum is very magnificent, so even if I order an ordinary house, I can be regarded as a great environment."
1,整体应该说不错，环境较美，服务也可以。餐饮价格还算公道。早餐品种少了点。,"The overall should be good, the environment is more beautiful, and the service is also available.The price of catering is fair.Breakfast varieties are less."
1,"房间设置实用,住19层安静,价格合适,以后还准备去.","The room is used to be practical, living in 19th floor is quiet, the price is appropriate, and you are ready to go in the future."
0,锦江贵宾楼我已经入住很多次了，我之所以选择它，是因为地理位置好，但是服务水平比较差，而且餐饮价格也不合理。并且现在装修噪音很大，下次我是不会选择了。宾馆反馈2008年1月7日：尊敬的宾客：由于酒店近期装修改造，给您带来了诸多不便对此我们深表歉意！根据客人反馈信息，我店对房价进行了调整，还为入住我店的客人赠送欢迎水果，房内免费宽带上网等增值服务，我们将秉承“宾客至上，服务第一”的宗旨，竭诚为您服务！,"I have been in Jinjiang VIP Tower many times. The reason why I chose it was because the geographical location was good, but the service level was poor, and the price of catering was unreasonable.And now the decoration is very noisy, I won't choose next time.Hotel feedback on January 7, 2008: Dear guest: Because of the recent decoration and renovation of the hotel, we have brought you a lot of inconvenience to we apologize for this!According to guest feedback information, our store has adjusted house prices, and also gives a welcome fruit for the guests who stay in our store, free broadband access to the house in the house, and we will adhere to the purpose of ""guest first, service first"", and wholeheartedly for you for youServe!"
1,"这次有朋友来上海玩,我想离我家近点,所以就选择了粤海酒店。在携程网上有看到酒店的电子实景图，感觉酒店不错。为了实地感受一下，我还特地去酒店看了一下，还真是那么回事。帮朋友订了一间大床房，558的房价倒是不贵，朋友住下来的感觉也挺好。","This time, a friend came to Shanghai to play. I wanted to be closer to my house, so I chose Yuehai Hotel.I saw the hotel's electronic real scene on the Ctrip.com, and the hotel felt good.In order to experience it on the spot, I went to the hotel to see it. It was really the case.I booked a large bed room for my friends. The house price of 558 was not expensive, and the friend's feelings felt very good."
1,住的是标准间，房间有点小，床也不是很舒服，服务还是不错的，所处的环境还不错，有很多可以吃的地方。浴室水龙头是很大，可是下水的声音更大，早上起来洗漱的时候，下水的声音就楞是把家人给吵醒了,"I live in the standard room, the room is a bit small, the bed is not very comfortable, the service is still good, the environment is not bad, there are many foods that can be eaten.The tap in the bathroom is very loud, but the sound of launching is even louder. When I get up in the morning, the sound of the launch is to wake the family awakening."
0,这个酒店已经是破烂不堪了，楼道和房间内充满了发霉的味道，地毯脏兮兮的，洗手台的水龙头已经活动了，极度不好用。本来订了一个星期的房，入住当天就打算换酒店了，因为离办事的地点近，所以忍了两天，到了第三天实在无法忍受了，夜里闹蚊子啊！要命！！！酒店给的电蚊香根本不管用，只好换了一家据说没开多久的新酒店，虽然远点，但是比这里便宜的多，设施强太多了。强烈不建议入住此酒店，否则一定后悔。,"This hotel is already dying. The corridor and the room are full of moldy taste. The carpet is dirty. The faucet on the washing table has been moved, which is extremely difficult to use.I originally booked a house for a week, and I planned to change the hotel on the day of staying. Because I was close to the location of the work, I endured it for two days. On the third day, I couldn't stand it.Destiny!IntersectionIntersectionThe electric mosquito coils given by the hotel do not use it at all, so I have to change to a new hotel that is said to be said to have not opened. Although it is far away, it is much cheaper than here and the facilities are too strong.It is not recommended to stay in this hotel, otherwise you must regret it."
1,近临富春江边，环境优美，喜欢早晨锻炼身体的好场所。,It is near the Fuchun River and has a beautiful environment. I like good places to exercise in the morning.
0,"太差,脏.差,我住过的最不好的酒店,以后决不住了","It's too bad, dirty. Poor, the most bad hotel I have lived in the future, I can't help it in the future"
0,房间有漏水痕迹，内部感觉也不好，价格也不便宜，不想再次入住,"There are traces of leakage in the room, the internal feel is not good, the price is not cheap, I don’t want to stay again"
0,该酒店是我住过的最差的酒店，房间设施陈旧，一股霉味，床单被褥粘糊糊的，最可气的是服务员绝然会栽赃陷害住客，我在那一共住了4天，7月20日结帐的时候前台说客房服务员检查发现有个付费毛巾被开封，我经常出差，住过无数酒店，还第一次遇到这种事情，我住酒店从不动那些付费用品，房间就我一个人住，其间没有任何访客，谁会去打开那个破包装毛巾，开了一个小口又不用，可酒店服务员硬说是我打开的，一个酒店硬件设施差点没什么，服务质量差点也有情可原，但服务员不诚实，甚至栽赃顾客是有本质问题的，奉劝大家千万不要住这家酒店。,"The hotel is the worst hotel I have lived in. The room facilities are old, a moldy smell, and the sheets and bedding are sticky.When checking on July 20, the front desk said that the guest room waiter found that a paid towel was opened. I often traveled on a business trip. I lived in countless hotels. I also encountered this kind of thing for the first time. I stayed in the hotel.I live alone, and there is no visitor during the meantime.Originally, the waiter was dishonest, and even the customers had essential problems. They advised everyone not to live in this hotel."
1,该酒店2008年刚刚装修，室内有浓重的装修建材味道，且窗户无法打开。另外该酒店重新装修过之后改名为现在的仁民，故大多的士司机不清楚酒店的位置,"The hotel was just renovated in 2008. There was a strong decoration building material in the room, and the windows could not be opened.In addition, the hotel renamed the current Renmin after renovation, so most of the taxi drivers did not know the location of the hotel."
1,"物有所值,但其预定车票的服务太一般,我给他们商务中心要求订次日到西安的卧铺票,除要收我30元订票费外还要收我他们订票员来回打的士钱20元,到头来也只能买到无座票,我只好不让他们订了(当然还付了20元的费),但次日我自己直接在火车站买了一张2120次到西安的卧铺票(票价80元硬卧上铺),并在上车后顺利换成软卧(当然又补了43元差","It is worth it, but the service of the scheduled tickets is too average.

0,性价比太差了！严重不复合所谓的4星标准，周围环境空气较差，最麻烦空调系统的冷气夹杂浓重的烟味，不开窗简直没法生存。,"The price / performance ratio is too bad!The so -called 4 -star standard is severe, the surrounding environment is poor, and the most troublesome air -conditioning system of the air -conditioning system is mixed with a strong smoke flavor. It is impossible to survive without opening the window."
0,这是我住过的最差的五星级酒店！8月5日住的所谓经济间，504元/晚；房间很小，通道小的只容下一条腿。卫生间没门，淋浴房居然也没门，洗澡水下不去，快漫出卫生间！换了一间，还是这样。地毯很脏！没有服务！再不住了！白送也不住！有被大刀砍的感觉。,"This is the worst five -star hotel I have lived!The so -called economic room lived on August 5th, 504 yuan/night; the room was small, and the small passage was small to accommodate one leg.There is no door in the bathroom, and the shower room has no door. If you do n’t go underwater, you will fly out of the bathroom!After changing, this is still the case.The carpet is dirty!No service!I can't stop it anymore!Can't help it!It feels like being chopped by a big knife."
0,此酒店是一座住宅大，由31以上改酒店，我入住的是一一房位，然有放式房，煮食灶，可是任何煮食用具都有。很大可惜只有坐位梳化，床房小得可，床只有一米，洗手也很小，淋浴小企缸跟坐及洗手在一起，剩空只能容一人。一可取的是下酒茶相。附近都是高的住宅，有甚物，$370的房在是不值。,"This hotel is a large residential, changing the hotel from 31 or more. I stayed in one -time room.Unfortunately, there are only sitting and combing, the bedroom is small, the bed is only one meter, and the washing hands are very small.What is advisable is the tea tea phase.There are high houses nearby, there are things, and houses of $ 370 are not worth it."
0,交通不便是地方最最令我失望的地方，住了三天，第一天，打不到的士，酒店的司了商竟然收我40去一上打只要不到20的地方。不是的，而是趁火打劫的行在令我怒。房的第二晚上，竟然有空，只慢吹。而且房的隔音也不怎么，白天晚上都可以到KTV和夜的歌。本酒店的房，和格我喜的，不以上的，以後真的不敢恭。,"The inconvenience of traffic was the most disappointed place in the place. After three days of staying, on the first day, the taxi who could not be hit, and the hotel's business took me 40 to play a place as long as less than 20.No, but the row of robbery in the fire made me angry.The second night of the room was free, only slowly blowing.Moreover, the sound insulation of the room is not very good. You can go to KTV and night songs during the day and night.The room of this hotel is good at He Ge."
0,房间残旧，天花发霉，卫生间马桶冲洗不干净。没有窗户，排气不好。以后不用钱都不去哪里住了,"The room is disabled, the ceiling is moldy, and the toilet toilet is not clean.No windows, poor exhaust.I do n’t need to live anymore in the future"
0,"这决对是个黑心店,完全把河南人的丑陋特性全展现出来了.一个床单被我掉色的内衣染红了一点.事实证明可以洗掉的,但他(她)们却收了我40元钱.其实床单只值10元.刚开始还不想开发票.我要找税务他们才作罢.朋友们千万别住了.","This decision is a black -hearted shop, which completely shows the ugly characteristics of Henan people.

1,"第二次住了四天,没有第一次的感觉好,第一个晚上进房间被单居然是脏的,然后浴袍是坏的,台灯也不是很好,总体一般.补充点评2008年7月23日：看到下面酒店回复说有免费的水果提供,可是住了一共五个晚上,因为投诉送了两个苹果两个橙之外没有欢迎果盆啊?我付的消费都够买一箱了吧,哈哈...地理位置很不错,正好可以逛恒陇和中信.","I lived for four days for the second time.

0,"11月2日刚去的莫干山,根据携程网的信息预定,由于从没有去过,所以对价钱并没有太具体的感觉,以为山上是比较贵的,但到了那边原来是一个私人承包的小旅馆,服务几乎没有,设施一般,更过分的是,老板心太黑,淡季居然依然收旺季的价格,一间要收790元,问了问其他的宾馆,包括最好的莫干山庄,比这家的环境服务质量要好上百倍,价格只要200多,真不可想象老板的心是怎么长的,携程居然回收录这样的商户,希望携程今后应多为客户利益着想,将这样的商户排除出去,以免其他人再上当,这样会极大的影响携程的形象的.","Mogan Mountain just went on November 2, according to the information booking of Ctrip.com, because I have never been there, I do n’t feel too specific for the price.There are almost no services in small hotels. The facilities are average. What's more is that the boss's heart is too dark, and the low season still collects the price of the peak season. One will collect 790 yuan.It is hundreds of times better than this environmental service quality, and the price is only more than 200. It is really impossible to imagine how the boss's heart is long. Ctrip actually recovers such merchants. I hope Ctrip should think more for customers in the future.Excluding it, so as not to be fooled by others, this will greatly affect the image of Ctrip."
1,哎，最过分的是现在停车竟然要40块，，，不知道怎么搞的，，一下子性价比低了很多，，,"Hey, the most excessive thing is that it costs 40 yuan now. I don’t know how to do it."
1,不错..性价比合理.交通方便就在远洋旁边.宾馆反馈2008年4月25日：谢谢您对我们酒店的支持!,"Yes .. It is reasonable to be cost -effective. The convenience of transportation is next to the ocean. Hotel feedback on April 25, 2008: Thank you for your support to our hotel!"
1,酒店内部设施不错，但可惜是游泳池一定要戴泳帽才能去，没有的话是３５元一顶，我们一大帮人不想为了游一下泳就给宰，只好望池兴叹了，酒店的人说是规矩，难道戴泳帽就能保证卫生了吗，那也是，少人游了就能保持泳池卫生了呀．,"The internal facilities of the hotel are good, but unfortunately, the swimming pool must wear a swimming hat to go. If not, it is 35 yuan a top. Our big group does not want to be slaughtered for swimming. We have to look at the pool.Regulations, can we wear a swimming hat to ensure hygiene? That's also, you can keep the swimming pool hygiene when you swim."
1,旧点比泉洲饭店好的多，泉洲只是样子好看，绣花枕头一个不信的自己去感受吧。而这个饭店就不一样了，门童热情。服务热情。感觉舒服，希望大家去感受一下就知道了,"The old point is much better than the Quanzhou Hotel. Quanzhou just looks good. Let's feel the embroidered pillow.And this restaurant is not the same, the door is enthusiastic.Service enthusiasm.I feel comfortable, I hope everyone will know it if you feel it"
1,酒店挺不错的，地理位置佳，交通方便，房间也很大，而且早餐算可以的了。下次来福州可能还会住这里。,"The hotel is pretty good, the geographical location is good, the transportation is convenient, the room is very large, and the breakfast is okay.Next time you come to Fuzhou, you may still live here."
1,房间还是不错的，住的枫丹白露，房间很大，比较有特色，有比较齐全的厨房设备，如果一家人出去玩可以买一些简单的食物自己烹调。不过服务要差一些，我们住了两天居然没有人来打扫房间，住了很多家酒店只有这家是这样的。后来问了前台，前台答复这里主要是会所，不太有经验。总体来说态度还是不错的。早餐比较差，除了包子就是花卷，两天都是这样，一碗白粥、一杯牛奶，因此三天的正餐都不敢在这里吃。还好离县城不远可以选择到县城吃，或在路口吃农家饭。不过出去玩住着还不错，很安静，周围都是别墅，门口有保安，相对安全，走出去不远就是红螺湖，我们沿着山路开车上去，走到有水的地方就停下休息，玩的很好。怀柔人民越来越会做生意，凡是能停车的水边全都有人“把守”，需要按人头收费才能玩，每人5元，价钱不高，但总让人有点感慨。总的来说五一还是很愉快。酒店人不多，下次可能还会选择。,"The room is still good. Feng Danbailu, who lives in, has a large room, more distinctive, and has a relatively complete kitchen equipment. If the family goes out to play, you can buy some simple food to cook.However, the service is worse. We lived for two days to clean the room. Only this is like this.Later, I asked the front desk. The front desk answered the main club, which was not very experienced.Overall, attitude is still good.Breakfast is poor. Except for buns, it is a flower roll. It is two days. A bowl of white porridge and a glass of milk, so I dare not eat here for three days of dinner.Fortunately, not far from the county seat, you can choose to eat at the county seat, or eat farm meals at the intersection.However, it ’s not bad to go out to play and live, very quiet, there are villas around, there are security guards at the door, relatively safe, not far away is Hongluo Lake. We drove along the mountain road.Play well.The people of Huairou are more and more business. Everyone who can park the water ""keeps"" and needs to be charged at the head to play. Each person is 5 yuan. The price is not high, but it is always a little emotional.In general, May Day is still very happy.There are not many people in the hotel, and they may choose next time."
0,"这是我住过的最差的星级酒店,连招待所都不如，房间小，潮湿，连张桌子都没有，最多的就是蚊子.还特毒.叮的腿肿了一个星期，我住的房间墙上还留着沾着我鲜血的蚊子的尸体.如果有奉献精神的建议你住这里.","This is the worst star hotel I have lived.

It is also poisonous.There is also the body of mosquitoes stained with my blood on the wall. If there is a dedication, it is recommended that you live here."
0,在当地算是比较好的酒店，所以每次去当地出差基本上都会住这家酒店。酒店服务一般，设施不是很理想，如果能够有针对性的进行改进会更好。,"It is a better hotel in the local area, so every time you go to the local business trip, you basically stay in this hotel.The hotel service is general, and the facilities are not ideal. It would be better if it can be improved targeted."
0,客观的评价，酒店的位置不错，但是周围的环境不好，门的位置较偏，感觉酒店不旺，但是生意较好，都是旅行团。门口打车不方便，有一个大坡，去的时候，赶上下雨，要冒雨跑下大坡，步行2分钟，才看到出租车！预订的是一件大床房间，很小。房间的采光不好。家具太久了，有霉味。电视很小，也旧。但是会赚钱，有三级片（没有看）70元。浴室很小，水龙头花洒管是漏的，叫人维修，很热情，本来以为会更换一条花洒软管，没想到，师傅手巧，剪掉漏的一节，又可以用了，开眼界（鄙人从事过水暖行业制造，对此感到惊奇）被子看来也是很旧，10月入住，重庆已经冷了，想开暖气，但是开了没有，打电话到客房中心查询，马上来了一个维修师傅，很客气的用四川话，检查后告诉我还没有供暖，当时室内温度19摄氏度，哈哈！总体感觉和4星酒店差距比较大，比曾经住过的银河大酒店比，差距很大！唯一可以说好一点的是：服务还可以，比较热情，诚恳，但是不专业！补充点评2007年11月1日：补充一点，大床，不是酒店通常的大床，不是2米床，也不是1.8米床，是标准的1.5米床（和一般家庭的床一样），这样的床，实在不是大床！,"Objective evaluation, the location of the hotel is good, but the surrounding environment is not good, the door is relatively biased, and the hotel is not strong, but the business is better, it is a tour group.It is inconvenient to take a taxi at the door. There is a big slope. When you go, catch the rain, take the rain and run down the slopes, walk for 2 minutes before you see a taxi!The book is a large bed, which is very small.The lighting of the room is not good.The furniture has been too long and has a moldy smell.TV is small and old.But it will make money, there are three -level films (not watching) 70 yuan.The bathroom is very small. The water tap shower tube is leaked. It is called maintenance and is very enthusiastic. I thought I would change a shower hose. I did not expect that the master was clever and cut off.I have been engaged in the manufacturing of the water and warmth industry, and I am surprised by this. The quilt also seems to be very old. I stayed in October. Chongqing was cold and wanted to turn on the heating, but I called the room center for inquiries and immediately came to a maintenance master., Very politely used the Sichuan dialect. After the inspection, I told me that there was no heating. At that time, the indoor temperature was 19 degrees Celsius, haha!The overall feeling is relatively different from the 4 -star hotel. Compared with the Galaxy Hotel that I have lived, there is a large gap!The only thing that can be said to be better is: the service is okay, more enthusiastic, sincere, but unprofessional!Supplementary comment on November 1, 2007: In addition, a big bed is not a large bed for hotels, not a 2 -meter bed, nor a 1.8 -meter bed.Bed, it's not a big bed!"
1,总体来说还不错，交通服务都还行，酒店有点年纪了，看上去档次不像四星的，大堂很旧，呵呵，性价比还凑合吧。,"Generally speaking, the traffic services are okay. The hotel is a bit old. It looks like four stars. The lobby is very old."
1,在北京算是不错了，价格还可以，还有水果送,"It is good in Beijing, the price is okay, and there are fruits to send"
1,闹中有静，物有所值。是我下次出差的首选。,"There is quiet in the trouble, and it is worthwhile.It is my first choice for my business trip."
1,以前住过，这次感觉没有以前好了。首先是房间里的设施折旧太快，像用了很多年似的。其次是离火车站太近，又在十字路口，白天汽车噪音大，空气也不好，晚上火车进出站汽笛声很吵人。其它的则一般般，普通而已。,"I have lived before, this time I felt that I did not have before.The first is that the facilities in the room are depreciated too fast, as if using it for many years.The second is that it is too close to the train station and at the crossroads. The car is noisy during the day and the air is not good.Others are ordinary, ordinary."
0,携程定的房，但是朝向是墓地方向的，大家要注意。服务极差，房间地上还有拖鞋没收拾，勺子也是脏的。第二天居然不来打扫卫生了。卫生间的浴帘没用的，洗个澡水会喷的到处都是。是我住过的最差的酒店了。郁闷！,"Ctrip's house, but the orientation is the direction of the cemetery, everyone should pay attention.The service was extremely poor. There were slippers on the room floor and the spoon was dirty.The next day I didn't come to clean.The bathroom shower curtain is useless, and a bath water will spray everywhere.It's the worst hotel I have ever lived.depressed!"
0,晚上没完没了的骚扰电话，让人真的不敢恭维补充点评2007年12月14日：我打的都是1分，怎么平均出来是2分？莫名其妙,"The harassment phone that is endless at night makes people really dare to compliment to supplement the comments on December 14, 2007: I played 1 point, how can I come out with 2 points on average?baffling"
1,"这个酒店总体不错,安排的房间正好可以看到海,就是普通话好像很难沟通亚~下次还会订","This hotel is generally good, the arrangement of the arrangement can be seen in the sea, that is, it seems that Mandarin seems to be difficult to communicate."
1,环境很不错，地理位置好。客人每次都住这里的。应该是挺满意的了。,The environment is very good and the geographical location is good.The guests live here every time.It should be quite satisfied.
1,在这个西部小城市能住上这样的酒店让我很欣喜，提供的免费接机服务方便了我的出行，地处市中心，购物很方便。早餐比较丰富，服务人员很热情。推荐大家也来试试，我想下次来这里我仍然会住这里。补充点评2008年8月15日：还要特别感谢客房服务员，在我流鼻血时，送来加湿器，真的好感动,"In this small city of western cities, I can live in such a hotel that makes me very happy. The free pick -up service provided is convenient for my travel. It is located in the center of the city. Shopping is very convenient.Breakfast is rich and the service staff is very enthusiastic.I recommend everyone to try it. I want to live here next time.Supplementary comment on August 15, 2008: I would like to thank the room waiters. When I nosebleed, I sent a humidifier, which was really moved."
1,东营最好的酒店了吧，各方面都比较不错，只是空调有些问题，关掉了房间还是很冷，不知道什么原因。东营的城市环境一般吧，否则真是比较完美了。,"It ’s the best hotel in Dongying. It is relatively good in all aspects, but there are some problems with air conditioners. It’ s very cold to turn off the room. I do n’t know why.Dongying's urban environment is average, otherwise it is really perfect."
0,根本就是一个招待所！亏的还能上携程网推荐！真是丢死人的脸了。前台（姑且升格称其为前台）服务态度差的要命，跟私人旅馆一样。服务员还好点。早餐比街边小馆子还不如，好像难民发救济。乐山当地酒店消费水平并不贵，三星的金叶也才200多一点。连卡都不能刷。强烈不推荐同志们去这家旅店！物无所值！,"It is simply a guest house!You can also recommend it to Ctrip.com!Really a dead face.The front desk (let's be promoted to the front desk) is terrible, just like a private hotel.The waiter is fine.Breakfast is not as good as the small restaurant on the street, it seems that refugees are reluctant.Leshan's local hotels are not expensive, and Samsung's golden leaves are only more than 200 a little.You can't even swipe your card.Strongly do not recommend comrades to this hotel!There is nothing worth!"
1,我订的是商务大床房，房间的确挺大，床是1.8的，卫生间也算大，但是台盆和台面看上去很脏，我用卷筒纸一抹，墨墨黑。洗澡那用的是浴帘，一碰到水尽往身上粘，不太舒服。,"I have a large business bed room. The room is really large. The bed is 1.8. The bathroom is also large, but the basin and the table look dirty.The shower curtain is used to take a bath. It is not very comfortable when I encounter water."
1,酒店是比较老的四星，设施都比较陈旧，房间也很小，健康秤还是坏的，总体感觉一般，但价格还是按照新四星来的，所以感觉不是很值。,"The hotel is a relatively old four -star. The facilities are relatively old, the room is small, the health scale is still bad, the overall feeling is average, but the price is still from the new four -star, so it feels not worth it."
1,入住酒店时把我自己行李丢在了出租车上，酒店的前厅部人员很热情，很积极帮我寻找，我很感动。酒店的总体感觉不错，舒适，安全，退房时候感觉两个总台人员不停的在忙碌，动作挺熟练，迅速的。,"When I stayed at the hotel, I threw my luggage on the taxi. The front hall of the hotel was very enthusiastic and actively helped me to find it. I was moved.The overall of the hotel feels good, comfortable, safe, and when I check out, I feel that the two heads are kept busy, and their movements are very skilled and fast."
1,"服务生很周到，携程和酒店的合作应该很好，有水果送，又可以免费洗烫2件衣服，而且速度很快。就是酒店的网速有待提高,网络游戏不能玩真是遗憾啊.前台服务很周到,表扬下","The waiter is very thoughtful. Ctrip and hotel cooperation should be very good. There are fruits and can be washed 2 pieces of clothes for free, and the speed is fast.That is, the hotel’s network speed needs to be improved. It is regrettable that online games cannot be played. The front desk service is very thoughtful and praise"
1,"酒店位置不错,离南京路很近但是闹中取静.二楼西餐厅菜品丰富,但是行政楼层的早餐太过简单,比不上其他五星酒店的行政俱乐部.行政间配有电脑,但是传真/打印机没有接上,形同虚设.酒店电梯需要插入房卡才可以使用,但是有几台电梯的设备不灵,非常不方便-我至少遇到两次到不了我选择楼层的情况,而随着电梯到其他楼层又转其他电梯上上下下.值得一提的是体贴的客房服务,非常友好和周到.","The hotel location is good, it is very close to Nanjing Road, but it is still quiet. The western restaurant on the second floor is rich, but the breakfast on the administrative floor is too simple. It is not as good as the administrative club of other five -star hotels.The printer is not connected. It is a virtual. The hotel elevator needs to be inserted into the room card before it can be used, but the equipment of several elevators is not spiritual, which is very inconvenient-I encountered at least twice to choose the floor of the floor.Other floors are transferred to other elevators up and down. It is worth mentioning that the thoughtful room service is very friendly and thoughtful."
1,通过协程订的。宾馆位置一般，只离苍浪亭近些，从高速下来还算方便。店内环境好，房间空间大，空调不错、洗刷设施好，床铺舒适。早餐不错。落地窗外就是一个小小苏州园林空间，虽简单，很好。值得推荐。,"Through the coroutine.The location of the hotel is average, and it is only close to Canglang Pavilion, which is convenient to come from the high speed.The environment in the store is good, the room is large, the air conditioner is good, the cleaning facilities are good, and the beds are comfortable.Breakfast is good.The floor -to -ceiling window is a small Suzhou garden space, although simple and good.Recommended."
0,建议不要入住！简直就是2星级以下的宾馆。根本体会不到啥服务。只有嘈杂的人声。整个就是接待旅游会议团队的只顾赚钱的宾馆。早上吃饭更是乱。吃个饭都不安宁。,It is recommended not to stay!It is a hotel below 2 stars.I can't get any service at all.Only noisy voices.The whole is a hotel that receives the tourism conference.Eating in the morning is even more chaotic.Eating a meal is restless.
1,还不错，之前住过，出行比较方便，这次网上预定还送了早餐，很划算,It's not bad. I have lived before and travel is more convenient.
1,订房之前是看了其它网友的点评的，所以对该酒店有大概的了解。总的来说，非常满意。我们一家是乘着孩子刚放暑假来玩恐龙园的，住的是700元/天的豪华大床间。房间很宽敞，设施齐全，特别是房间里还配了电脑，可以免费上网（网速一般）。一楼餐厅有中西自助餐厅和中餐厅，去中西自助餐厅用餐的人比较少，大部分房客选择在中餐厅，所以造成上菜比较慢，不过饭菜口味还不错。早晨有免费自助早餐（按房间实际入住人数，我门因为是两个大人一个孩子，所以给了三张餐票，没有出现需要补一份小孩餐费的情况），早餐品种比较丰富。去恐龙园需要凭房卡在总台登记，然后有专人带领进入。上午分9点、10点、11点三批，下午还有一批。需要提醒的是，上午九点之前退房的人较多，因此，如果希望跟9点的这批入园，最迟8:30就要到前台来排队办理。,"Before booking, I read the reviews of other netizens, so I had a general understanding of the hotel.Overall, very satisfied.Our family is playing dinosaur garden just for the summer vacation, and we live in a luxurious large bed of 700 yuan/day.The room is very spacious and complete, especially the computer is also equipped with computers, which can access the Internet for free (general network speed).On the first floor, there are Chinese and Western buffet restaurants and Chinese restaurants. There are relatively few people who go to Chinese and Western buffet restaurants. Most tenants choose to be in Chinese restaurants, so they make the food slower, but the taste of the meals is not bad.There are free buffet breakfast in the morning (the actual number of people in the room, because my door is two adults and a child, so I gave three meals, and there was no case to make a child's meal fee). The breakfast variety was rich.To go to the dinosaur garden, you need to register with the housing card with the house card, and then some people will lead.At 9 o'clock, 10 o'clock, and 11 o'clock in the morning, there was a batch in the afternoon.It should be reminded that there are more people who check out before 9 am. Therefore, if you want to enter the park with 9 o'clock, you will go to the front desk to queue at 8:30 at the latest."
1,7月中旬入住过一晚，说说感受。硬件条件和皇冠的牌子还是比较匹配的，但软件（服务）还差的很多。1.入住那天被安排进了一间高级间，洗澡的时候发现没有浴帘，结果弄的厕所满地都是水，打电话去问，告知：这种浴缸是给那些泡澡的人设计的。言外之意是不适合淋浴。洗手间内并没有另外的淋浴房。2.健身房内的跑步机的传送带很窄，跑步的时候经常担心会摔倒。健身房内的矿泉水要收15一瓶，水就是房间里免费的那种。据理力争了半天，把大堂经理都折腾上来才免费了。3.结账的时候钱都付完，发票也开完了，被告知还有上网费没有结清。就是那著名的11.5一小时的上网费。头回听说都结完帐了还要收钱的。4.门口出租车坐地起价。因为赶飞机，让门僮帮忙拦了一部出租车，车刚开出去没多远，司机就抬高价格，如果不接受他就不拉。据司机说是要给门僮好处费。因为赶飞机，只能付了冤枉钱。5.最后说说大堂。大堂搞了很多山山水水，的确是很漂亮，不过也成了蚊子的温床。在大堂久留一定会被蚊子咬的。,"I stayed in mid -July for one night and talked about feelings.The hardware conditions are more matched with the crown brand, but the software (service) is much worse.1. On the day of the check -in, I was arranged into a high room. When I took a bath, I found that there was no shower curtain. As a result, the toilet was full of water, called and asked: This bathtub was designed for those who bathing.EssenceThe implication is not suitable for shower.There are no other shower rooms in the toilet.2. The conveyor belt of the treadmill in the gym is very narrow, and I often worry about falling when running.The mineral water in the gym needs 15 bottles, and the water is the free in the room.After a long time, the lobby manager tossed all the time before it was free.3. The money is paid at the checkout, and the invoice is issued. The online fees were told that there was still an online fee.It is the famous 11.5 hour online fee.I heard that I had to collect money after I heard it.4. The taxi at the door starts the price.Because of catching the plane, I asked Men Tong to stop a taxi. As soon as the car drove out, the driver raised the price. If he did not accept him, he would not pull.According to the driver, the benefits of the door are the benefits.Because of catching up the plane, you can only pay the wrong money.5. Finally talk about the lobby.The lobby has a lot of mountains and rivers, which is indeed beautiful, but it has also become a hotbed of mosquitoes.It will definitely be bitten by a mosquito in the lobby for a long time."
1,"酒店还是不错的,房间挺大的,床很舒服,服务人员的态度很不错的,有问必答的,周围交通很方便,离码头很近的,而且门口就有去大三八和妈祖庙的公交,不错","The hotel is still good, the room is quite large, the bed is very comfortable, the attitude of the service staff is very good, there is a question of answering, the surrounding traffic is very convenient, it is very close to the dock, and there is a SUFS and Mazu Temple at the door.Bus, yes"
1,非常好的一家酒店!房间特别棒!很喜欢!老美都说是NICEHOTEL.下次来就这家了!宾馆反馈2008年4月14日：您的满意是我们最大的追求，期待着您的再来光临！,"A very good hotel! The room is particularly great! I like it very much! Lao Mei said it is Nicehotel. I will come next time! Hotel feedback on April 14, 2008: Your satisfaction is our biggest pursuit, looking forward to yourCome again!"
1,酒店不错，特别是离长途汽车站近（马路对面），酒店的饭菜不错，价格不贵，菜式较多，对面就是劝业场，可以逛逛。出门坐人力车到闹市也很方便。不足之处就是住酒店还要付10元的停车过夜费，感觉不太爽！,"The hotel is good, especially close to the long -distance bus station (opposite the road). The hotel's meals are good, the price is not expensive, and the dishes are more. The opposite side is the persuasion field. You can go shopping.It is also very convenient to go out to the city.The shortcoming is that staying at the hotel for 10 yuan for a parking fee, it feels not very good!"
1,房间里面的破地图，竟然要收费10元，是唯一的遗憾莫不如酒店自己印个地图，方便客人总体说，比对面的圣地酒店好太多了,"The broken map in the room has to charge 10 yuan. It is the only regret. It is better to print a map by the hotel, which is convenient for guests to say that it is much better than the Holy Land Hotel on the opposite side."
0,床发出吱嘎吱嘎的声音，房间隔音太差，赠送的早餐非常好吃。补充点评2008年7月22日：我们住的是度假村的标准间。,"The crunching sound was made, the room sound insulation was too bad, and the free breakfast was very delicious.Supplementary review July 22, 2008: We live in the standard room of the resort."
1,明星康年整体感觉相当不错。房间宽敞、环境良好，应该是当地最好的酒店吧。虽然只住了1个晚上，以后如果再去遂宁，一定继续预定明星康年。,"Star Kangnian feels pretty good as a whole.The room is spacious and good environment. It should be the best local hotel.Although only one night, if you go to Suining in the future, you must continue to book Star Kang Nian."
1,优点就是位置好，去大运村或中关村办事方便。携程的价格真的不够优惠啊，还不包早餐。,"The advantage is that the location is good, and it is convenient to go to Grand Canal Village or Zhongguancun.Ctrip's price is really not discount enough, not to include breakfast."
0,虽然在火车站不远处，走对路10到15分钟，但位置比较不好找，如果不打车去基本得问两三人。打电话到酒店问路时发现接待员也对具体怎么到达不太清楚。位置比较偏，但是住九楼早上也会被车吵醒，也许仅仅和当地司机习惯按喇叭有关。房间比较大，但是地毯有污迹，和两星半的级数不符。楼下晚上有小食摊倒是挺方便。,"Although not far from the train station, walking for 10 to 15 minutes, the location is not easy to find. If you don't take a taxi, you have to ask two or three people.When I called the hotel to ask the road, I found that the receptionist was not very clear about how to reach it.The location is relatively biased, but the ninth floor will be woken up by a car in the morning, maybe only the local driver is used to press the horn.The room is relatively large, but the carpet has stains and does not match the two -star level.There is a snack stand downstairs. It is very convenient."
0,"了二次房间,第一间在洗地毯(前台竟然不知!!??),第二间房门不用钥匙就能开,到第三间己经不是预定的大床房....窗外还有一个蜘蛛在结网","After the second room, the first room was washing the carpet (the front desk did not know !! ??), the second room door could be opened without a key, and the third room was not a scheduled large bed room .... Outside the windowThere is a spider in the network"
1,"房间总体还是很不错的,但房间隔音效果比较一般,在房间很容易听到走廊上别人的说话,谢谢.","The overall room is still very good, but the room sound insulation effect is relatively average. It is easy to hear the words of others in the corridor in the room, thank you."
1,我住的是2房一厅的套房。房子空间甚大，正是我所希望的。位置距各商业区不远，附近也有吃饭的地方。有热水，空调，木地板。就这个价格而言，颇满意。蚊子很是厉害，第一天晚上被咬了好几个包，数天之后不能消退，可能是毒蚊子。第二天向服务台要了电蚊香，就没有再被蚊子咬，服务台态度不错。卫生间内的各个水龙头，都有些老化了，因为我多年前曾参加过一个给排水工程项目的设计，善于调水龙头，其他人可能会有一定困难。向携程网订房时，被告知每房每天提供免费软料2瓶。我订的是2房一厅，因此提供免费软料4瓶。入住时，再次向服务台核实，确实如此。结帐时却被告知每天只提供免费软料2瓶，因此被要求支付额外费用。甚幽默。感谢以前入住的朋友的点评，知道出租车司机不易找到酒店大门，所以提前提醒出租车司机，顺利地找到了酒店大门。总的来说，还不错。,"I live in a 2 -bedroom and one -living suit.The room space is very large, exactly what I want.The location is not far from all commercial areas, and there are places to eat nearby.There are hot water, air conditioning, wooden floor.As far as this price is concerned, it is quite satisfied.The mosquito was very powerful. He was bitten several bags on the first night. After a few days, he could not disappear. It may be a poisonous mosquito.The next day I asked the service desk for electric mosquito coils, and I was not bitten by mosquitoes. The service desk attitude was good.The faucets in the bathroom are a little aging, because I have participated in a design of a drainage engineering project many years ago. I am good at adjusting the drainage. Others may have some difficulties.When booking with Ctrip.com, it was informed that 2 bottles of free soft materials are provided every day.I booked a two -bedroom and one room, so 4 bottles of free soft materials are provided.When checking in, it is true to verify the service desk again.When checking out, it was told that only 2 bottles of free soft materials were provided every day, so the additional fee was required to pay.Very humorous.Thanks to the comments of friends who stayed in before, knowing that the taxi driver is not easy to find the hotel door, so he reminded the taxi driver in advance and successfully found the hotel door.Overall, pretty good."
1,"入住时碰到一群北京来的醉鬼在大堂舞醉拳,有个哥们指着女接待员的鼻子在骂""你妈X"",而且骂了好多次,还威胁要砸场子.居然没有一个保安出来阻止.幸亏是晚上十点多,当时酒店下面客人并不多,要不可闹啦.","During the check -in, I met a group of drunks from Beijing dancing into the lobby. Some buddies pointed at the female receptionist's nose scolding ""your mother X"", and scolded many times, and threatened to smash the field. No security guard came out.Fortunately, it was more than 10 o'clock in the evening. At that time, there were not many guests under the hotel."
1,"3月住了4晚,感觉不错,比翠怡要好5月还来","I lived for 4 nights in March, I feel good, better than Cui Yi, come back in May"
0,"订的豪华单人房比双人房要小1/3,设施也差,甚至没有茶几和圈椅,可是价格比双人房却要贵好多,真的不可思议!我是该酒店双人房的常客。也许是酒店自己也觉得不靠谱，在我外出是，悄悄地搬进两张圈椅，将原来房间里的靠背椅换出，可是由于房间空间太小，椅子实际上是无法坐人的，只能放东西用！前台服务还算可以，我身份证忘带了，告诉是常客，查了一下电脑资料，就让入住了。","The luxurious single room is 1/3 smaller than the two -person room, and the facilities are worse. There are even no coffee tables and circle chairs, but the price is much more expensive than the two -person room. It is really incredible! I am a frequent visitor to the hotel in the hotel.Perhaps the hotel itself feels unreliable. When I go out, I moved into two circle chairs and replaced the back chair in the original room. However, because the room space is too small, the chair is actually unable to sit on, but only the chair is actually unable to sit.Can put things!The front desk service is okay. My ID card forgot to bring it. I told it to be a frequent visitor. After checking the computer information, I allowed to stay."
0,"就没有见过这样的酒店,价格不便宜,设备特别陈旧,房间昏暗,外部内部都特脏,上面写有宽贷竟然还要20元钱,要钱也罢了,IP地址都不能自动获取.","I have never seen such a hotel. The price is not cheap, the equipment is particularly old, the room is dim, and the outside is particularly dirty inside. It has a wide loan on it and it costs 20 yuan. If you want money, the IP address cannot be automatically obtained."
1,替朋友订的房间，据说还不错啦，一下回，自己去试试。,The room for a friend is said to be pretty good. Go back and try it yourself.
1,我7月份去的，总的一句话，还可以。如果还去大理，也许还会定，酒店的免费温泉是一个亮点。,"I went in July, in the general sentence, it was okay.If you still go to Dali, you may be sure that the free hot spring of the hotel is a highlight."
1,客户来佛山工厂拜访，安排在这家老牌三星酒店，尽管客房设施稍显成就，但价格也不贵，关键在地处市中心，购物吃饭都很方便。对于这个房价来说，还算可以吧。,"Customers come to the Foshan factory to visit and arrange at this old Samsung Hotel. Although the guest room facilities are slightly achieved, the price is not expensive. The key is located in the center of the city, and it is convenient to shop and eat.For this house price, it's okay."
1,"酒店还可以,前台的小姐很热情.周边有很多的商店和餐馆.不好的地方是酒店的卡拉ok12店下班,不能早睡,房间和对面楼很近,要拉窗帘.",The hotel is also okay. The lady at the front desk is very enthusiastic. There are many shops and restaurants in the surrounding area. The bad place is the hotel's Kara OK12 shop to get off work. You can't go to bed early. The room and the opposite building are very close. To pull the curtains.
0,最初给我的270的大床间是临街的，要命的是窗户还是坏的，根本没办法隔音，所以要求换到了不临街的豪华标间，房间有味，所幸得是只需要住一个晚上，早餐另收了10元，结账时前台非常不专业，发票自己随手搞到地上了，还一个劲问是不是拿给我了，印象差,"At first, the 270 large bed was facing the street. The windows were still bad. There was no way to sound insulation at all.I received another 10 yuan for breakfast. At the checkout, the front desk was very unprofessional. I got the invoice on the ground by myself. I also asked me if I gave it to me."
1,房间狭小，设备普通。交通方便，时代广场走走就到了，早上可以去喝早茶，非常好吃。补充点评2007年11月23日：不好意思，评错酒店了。正确的应该是房间很大很好，缺点是地点比较偏。,"The room is small and the equipment is ordinary.The transportation is convenient. Times Square is walking. You can go to drink morning tea in the morning, which is very delicious.Supplementary comment on November 23, 2007: I'm sorry, the wrong hotel.The right thing is that the room is very good, and the disadvantage is that the location is relatively biased."
0,我终于在2008年的寒冬选择去尝试这家酒店。我对新鲜的事物一向用于尝试，愿意给她们机会，可是这次真的是上当太大，划不来了。这个公寓式酒店的几个致命弱点列举如下：1、空调简直一塌糊涂。功率小、噪音大。开了，不管什么用，而且吵得你无法安宁；关了，27层楼的房间里冷得呼气都可以看见。2、洗衣机不是每个房间都有。这个有点虚假宣传。3、热水器因为水压的问题，冷热不定。不冻死你算你运气。4、洗澡间没有暖气，如果热水不够强劲，肯定感冒。5、阳台封了，不给进去。6、网络跟乌龟爬的速度一样。总体说来，这家酒店在不需要空调、热水的季节还算可以，其他季节就免了。399一个晚上的公寓，一个月就是12000，这个价格在上海能租什么房子？？？建议入住的人自己考虑清楚。,"I finally chose to try this hotel in the cold winter of 2008.I have always used fresh things to try and are willing to give them a chance, but this time I really should be too big and I can't draw it.Several fatal weaknesses of this apartment -style hotel are listed as follows: 1. The air conditioner is almost a mess.Small power and high noise.Open, no matter what, and you can't be peaceful, you can see it, you can see it in the 27 -story room.2. The washing machine is not available in every room.This is a bit of false publicity.3. Due to the problem of water pressure, the water heater is hot and cold.Don't frozen to death, you are lucky.4. There is no heating in the bathroom. If the hot water is not strong enough, it must have a cold.5, the balcony is sealed, not given in.6. The network is the same as the speed of climbing turtles.In general, this hotel is okay in the season without air conditioning and hot water, and other seasons are avoided.The 399 -night apartment is 12,000 a month. What kind of house can this price rent in Shanghai?IntersectionIntersectionIt is recommended that people who stay in their own considers themselves clearly."
1,第一次预订这家酒店，开了有段时间，门面比较小，不过里边的房间还是比较大的。因为是替别人订的，进去看了以后觉得设施蛮齐全的，要的大床房的确很大很舒服，以后要订也会再订这家的。宾馆反馈2008年4月28日：非常感谢您的入住及您对我们的肯定，我们将为您以后的每一次入住提供更贴心的服务！期待您的入住！,"For the first time to book this hotel, for a while, the facade was relatively small, but the room inside was still relatively large.Because it is booked for others, I feel that the facilities are quite complete after reading it. The big bed room is really very comfortable. I will order this one in the future.Hotel feedback on April 28, 2008: Thank you very much for your check -in and your affirmation of us. We will provide more intimate services for you every time in the future!Looking forward to your check -in!"
1,"本来整体感觉不错,虽然价位比较高.我在入住的第二天晚上,室内温度上升到26度,问酒店的服务中心,她们说由于外面的天气比较冷(14-17度左右),现在空调只是有自然风~~~我说,外面是冷,但室内在没有窗户的情况下室温那么高,怎么睡?!最后得来的答案是酒店方面是不肯开冷空调的了,就拿了一把风扇给我!!!一家国际五星饭店居然用这种方法来处理,实在失望.除此之外,所有服务都是水准以内的.所以,以后大家去住就要选在正夏天或正冬天,否则没有空调.","Originally, the overall feeling was good, although the price was relatively high. The next night I stayed, the indoor temperature rose to 26 degrees. Ask the hotel's service center, they said that because the weather was relatively cold (about 14-17 degrees), the air conditioner is now air-conditioning. Now the air conditioner is now the air conditioner.It ’s just a natural style ~~~ I said, it’ s cold outside, but the room temperature is so high when there is no window in the room. How can I sleep?! The last answer is that the hotel is not willing to turn on the air conditioner.Give me a fan !!! A international five -star hotel actually uses this method to deal with it, which is really disappointed. In addition, all services are within the standard. So, if you live in the futureWinter, otherwise there is no air conditioner."
1,还不错得酒店，我去过夏威夷，那里不如这里，这里得感觉才像4星的，就是前台的女孩不热情，很冷淡的接待你。我住的350的双人房间，床很大，房间也很宽敞，每天又2瓶免费的矿泉水，有保险箱，有小冰箱，电视是25寸的，能免费上网，电视也能上网，有星空电影，凤凰卫视一些频道，就是没有BBC，CNN什么的。早餐还算一般，比较丰富，就是没有我爱吃的东西。对了电视上网还有一个无线的小键盘，比较有意思。这里还有很多房型，比如无烟层，女性层，A型标准间，普通标准间等等，不知道携程为什么只提供了这么少的房型。我本来要订10天的房子，可是只给订5天，入住后再续住，比较麻烦，而且我订之后发现金鼎和夏威夷在携程上都显示满了，可是我在酒店前台问，还有很多空房可以住，不知道这是怎么会事。金鼎的餐厅饭菜还可以，夏威夷我也去吃了，和我们一起的老美说，夏威夷太难吃了，还是金鼎好些。这里交通很方便，距离步行街很近，但不吵，夏威夷离步行街太近了，比较吵，也比较闹一些。还有，我对携程订房有些意见，如果我入住时间比较长，酒店那方就不让订了，我只能先入住，然后再续住～，不太合理。牡丹江还有一些酒店，比如远东，就在夏威夷对面，携程上不能订，金鼎对面和斜对面要开2个比较大的酒店，看装修应该是4星了，不知道怎么样。点评完毕，谢谢收看。不到支持请见谅。,"It's not bad, I have been to Hawaii, there is not as good as here. It feels like 4 stars here. The girl at the front desk is not enthusiastic and receives you coldly.The 350 double room I live in, the bed is very large, and the room is very spacious. There are 2 bottles of free mineral water every day.Some channels for movies, Phoenix Satellite TV, there are no BBC, CNN or something.Breakfast is quite average, it is relatively rich, but there is no thing I love to eat.By the way, there is a wireless small keyboard on the Internet, which is more interesting.There are many room types, such as smokeless layers, women's layers, type A standard rooms, ordinary standard rooms, etc. I don't know why Ctrip provides only so few room types.I originally had a 10 -day house, but I only booked for 5 days and renewed it after check -in. It was more troublesome, and after I booked, I sent cash and Hawaii.Many empty houses can live, I don't know how this is.Jin Ding's restaurant's meals are okay. I also went to eat in Hawaii. Lao Mei, who was with us, said that Hawaii was too unpalatable, and it was better.The traffic here is very convenient. It is very close to the pedestrian street, but it is not noisy. Hawaii is too close to the pedestrian street. It is more noisy and more troubled.Also, I have some opinions on Ctrip's booking. If I stay in for a long time, the hotel's party will not let the booking. I can only stay in first, and then continue ~, it is not reasonable.There are also some hotels in Mudanjiang, such as the Far East, just opposite Hawaii. You ca n’t book on the Ctrip. There are 2 relatively large hotels across the opposite side of Kim Ding and the opposite side. It should be 4 stars to see the decoration.After the comment is over, thank you for watching.Forgive support, please forgive me."
1,10月19日上岛的，11点到大堂，房间还没有好要等到下午1点，于是寄存行李，步行欣赏沿途风光，快12点赶往冬季码头潜水，中午工作人员为了节省时间没有培训就把我们送上船了，好在我的东北教练很负责任给我额外培训，虽然受天气影响能见度不高只看到几只小丑鱼，海葵和珊瑚，但也是很美好的潜水回忆了。---上午的时间安排很成功，避免了等待及厌烦。下午1点结束潜水在冬季码头乘坐免费的电瓶车到大堂，直接拿房间钥匙，由电瓶车免费送上去。不过观海木楼在山顶，有多个台阶车子只送到一半，要自己走上去。房间是8626有很不错的角度看海景，房间很有特色，设施齐全室外还有独立的游泳池，蜜月旅行酒店还特意送了果盘，潜水耳朵进水要了棉签，服务生很快就爬上山送来了，感觉这里的服务很错的。不过因为出于“室外桃源，人间仙境”的岛上，人和小动物和谐共处，所以有很多小家伙出入，我们看到好几只壁虎，小虫，飞蛾还有蛤蟆，蛤蟆从门缝钻进房间一跳就找不到了，我紧张的打电话给前台问是否会有蛇，蛤蟆还不算可怕，如果有蛇就太恐怖了，服务生说房间附近的草木都洒了硫磺，绝对不会有蛇的，还热心的问是否需要来帮我抓蛤蟆，被我们谢绝了。害怕有别的小东西再进来，老公用报纸堵住门缝，喷了防蚊药水，还把墙上的几个木头洞用纸巾堵上了，不过我还是睡不踏实，半夜4点惊醒尖叫，原来蛤蟆跳到被窝里把我吓醒了！老公惊醒就来说赶蛤蟆，那场景真实难忘啊！回来的路上老公还戏称这为“美好的回忆”呢！心惊胆战的度过一夜人很累一直睡到早上10点多，错过了看日出，在木楼上景色很不错，我们享受好美景就去退房，速度很快，服务态度也很好。然后又帮我们把行李存好。退房后我们又继续沿海滩行走，玩水到中午12点去海鲜自助餐厅吃“早中饭”，40元一人，虽然海鲜种类不多，可无限量供应的和乐蟹让人过足了瘾，伴着碧海蓝天椰林进餐，真是享受啊。吃好饭继续边走边看，一直走到未开发禁止通行牌才打道回大堂，再乘免费电瓶车送到码头坐船。时间很充裕的，因为我们把无谓的等待时间都利用起来了，感觉很不错。,"Those who go to the island on October 19th, arrive at the lobby at 11 o'clock, the room is not good until 1 pm, so I store my luggage, walk on the way to enjoy the scenery along the way, and rush to the winter pier dive.I sent us to the boat. Fortunately, my Northeast coach was very responsible for training me. Although the visibility was not highly affected by the weather, I saw a few clown fish, anemone and corals, but it was also a very beautiful diving memory.--- The morning schedule is very successful, avoiding waiting and boring.After 1 pm, the diving is a free battery car to the lobby at 1 pm, take the room key directly, and send it to the battery car for free.However, at the top of the mountain, there are only half of the number of steps that are sent to the mountain, so you have to go up.The room is 8626 with a very good angle to see the sea view. The room is very distinctive. There are independent swimming pools outside the outdoor facilities. The honeymoon travel hotel also deliberately sent a fruit plate.Here, I feel that the service here is wrong.However, because of the island of ""Outdoor Taoyuan, Wonderland on Earth"", people and small animals live in harmony, so there are many little guys in and out. We see several geckos, small worms, moths, and toads.I ca n’t find it when I jump into the room. I call nervously to ask the front desk to ask if there will be snakes. The toad is not terrible. If there is a snake, it is too scary.There will be snakes, and I also enthusiastically ask if I need to help me catch the toad, we have declined.Fear of coming in again, my husband's newspaper blocked the door seam, sprayed anti -mosquito water, and blocked a few wooden caves on the wall with paper towels, but I still couldn't sleep well, and I woke up at 4 o'clock in the middle of the night.Called, it turned out that the toad jumped into the bed and woke me up!When my husband wakes up, you can catch the toad. That scene is really unforgettable!On the way back, my husband also joked that this was ""good memories""!The people who were frightened overnight were tired and slept until 10 o'clock in the morning. I missed the sunrise. The scenery on the wooden building is very good. We enjoy the good scenery and go out to check out. The speed is fast and the service attitude is very good.Then help us save our luggage.After checking out, we continued to walk along the beach again. Play water until 12 noon to go to the seafood buffet restaurant to eat ""early meal"", 40 yuan per person, although there are not many types of seafood, the harmony crabs that can be supplying unlimitedIt ’s really enjoyable to eat with the blue sea and blue sky coconut forest.I continued to watch a good meal. I walked back to the lobby until I did not develop the card without development.Time is plenty of time, because we use the unnecessary waiting time and feel very good."
1,订的单人间，房间不大，隔音效果不是很好，可以听到隔壁说话的声音；房间里比较昏暗，但还算干净。旋转餐厅还不错，吃饭时心情很好。房间里没有吹风机，打个电话，服务员马上送来，态度很好。结帐时前台表情冷漠，不如check-in的态度好。补充点评2008年7月10日：门童服务超级差劲！我一个女孩子提着大箱子，他看了一眼，什么也没说什么也没做就走来了，令人心里很不舒服！！,"In the single -player room, the room is not large, and the sound insulation effect is not very good. You can hear the sound of talking next door; the room is dim, but it is clean.The rotating restaurant is not bad, and I feel good when I eat.There is no hair dryer in the room. If you call, the waiter will send it immediately.The front desk is indifferent at the checkout, which is not as good as Check-in.Supplementary comment on July 10, 2008: Mennong service is super bad!A girl with a big box, he glanced at him, and came without saying nothing or not. It was very uncomfortable!Intersection"
0,非常失望的一个酒店，设施相对淄博宾馆等酒店算好，但是房间的烟味非常重，这还是安排的无烟房间，这些就算了，本来对淄博的酒店没有太大期望，但是没想到还有更糟糕的，我预定了去济南的酒店的车，礼宾部告诉我是280元，我确认预定并说明结帐时列在我的房帐上，第二天一早我又打电话确认，结果下午1点结帐时说前台小姐说没收到预定，非常傲慢无礼，要求我先结房费，接着礼宾部拿来一张单据要我签署价格不是280元，而是280元＋15％服务费，我还是第一次遇到这种情况，酒店说我要是付现金就还是280元，不用付15％服务费，我请大堂副经理过来，她解释是刷信用卡酒店要支付手续费所以加收15％，我认为不合理，因为1）礼宾部没有在我定车时说明这一点，2）银行的手续费竟然要15％，从来没听说过这么高的银行刷卡手续费。最后，在我强烈的抗议之下，大堂副经理说还是按照280元刷信用卡来收。上了预定的车才知道，是出租车，不是酒店的专用车，因为酒店没有车队，就和5辆出租车签订了协议，出租车每年交纳给酒店几千块管理费，然后酒店客人定去济南机场的车就叫他们，要说明的是我乘坐的这辆出租车的服务很好。从性价服务比上看这家酒店不合适，我不会再入住了。,"A very disappointed hotel, facilities are calculated as good as hotels such as Zibo Hotel, but the smell of smoke in the room is very heavy. This is still a smokeless room arranged. Even if this is, there is no much expectation for the hotel in Zibo, but I did not expect that there are still there are still there are still there are still there are still there are still there are still there are still there are still there are still there are still there are still there are still there are still there are still there are still there is still there.To make a worse, I booked a car in the hotel in Jinan. The Li Bin department told me that it was 280 yuan. I confirmed that I was scheduled and explained that I was listed on my room account when I was settled. I called again the next morning.At 1 o'clock, the front desk lady said that the front desk did not receive the reservation, very arrogant and rude, asked me to settle the house fee first, and then I brought a document for the Li Bin department for me to sign the price not 280 yuan, but 280 yuan + 15 % service fee.I am still the first time I encountered this situation. The hotel said that if I paid cash, I would still be 280 yuan, and I did n’t have to pay 15 % of the service fee. I asked the deputy manager of the lobby to come over.%, I think it is unreasonable, because 1) Li Bin department did not explain this when I set the car, 2) The bank's handling fee actually cost 15 %, and I have never heard of such a high bank credit card fee.In the end, under my strong protest, the deputy manager of the lobby said that he still wiped the credit card at 280 yuan.I learned that it was a taxi that was a taxi. It was not a special car in the hotel. Because the hotel did not have a team, they signed an agreement with 5 taxis. The taxi paid thousands of dollars to the hotel each year. Then the hotel guests decided to goThe car at Jinan Airport called them. What I want to explain is that the taxi I am riding is very good.From the perspective of price services, this hotel is not suitable, and I won't stay in."

1,"同一客人第二次到香港，我第二次用携程帮他订的酒店．找了香港很多其它酒店，就这家性价比最高．但是我自己过去的时候发现，从地铁出来后，远远就能看见酒店大大的PANDA,可走了很久问了好多人才能走进酒店!!客人说他晚上出门买点东西,结果找不到方向打了五分钟都不到的的士回来的!!那种道路建设,如果不是非常熟悉路的,的确是很让人迷糊....不过,总的来讲,客人说他下次仍会住这家,尽管离市区偏远,但相对安静,没有市区的嘈杂.或许这也是他们便宜的缘故所在.每个人各取所好了.建议地铁出来后多建点往酒店的标示牌会更好!补充点评2008年7月2日：因为道理交通的问题,本打算给4.0的,怎么习惯性的钩了5.0....","The same guest went to Hong Kong for the second time, and I used the hotel to help him book for the second time.I found many other hotels in Hong Kong, and the most cost -effective.But when I passed by myself, I found that after coming out of the subway, I can see the big panda of the hotel from a distance, but after a long time, I asked many people to enter the hotel !!

1,每次去太原，都住这家酒店。。。就太原市的水平来看还是不错的；但是横向比较其他城市，这个价位的性价比，显然不足。,"Every time I go to Taiyuan, I live in this hotel.EssenceEssenceIn terms of the level of Taiyuan City, it is still good; but compared with other cities horizontally, the cost -effectiveness of this price is obviously insufficient."
1,总体来说不错。交通比较方便，早餐也可以。步行去沃尔玛购物约十分钟。去旅游的话还是开车方便，景点可以去多去几处。补充点评2008年4月13日：小心电梯夹人，合上的速度太快了，很少见。,"Overall is good.Transportation is more convenient and breakfast is fine.Walk to Wal -Mart for about ten minutes.It is convenient to drive if you travel. You can go to a few more attractions.Supplementary comment on April 13, 2008: Be careful of the elevator to clip people."
1,"这个酒店的地理位置不错,离火车站很近,出行特方便.周边环境也不错,有公安厅、省委、让人感觉很安全，酒店服务也很好，本人将项链放在电视机旁，走的时候忘记拿了，结帐时，服务员很温婉的提醒我，让我很感动，真是个不错的酒店，建议大家去长沙可以选择这个酒店试试。补充点评2008年7月2日：以前跟朋友入住酒店时,早餐是设在负一楼的,环境不好.这次有惊喜的发现,早餐已经搬到一楼咖啡厅了,感觉很好,总的来说,酒店真的很不错,下次来长沙,还选择住这个酒店.","The geographical location of this hotel is good, it is very close to the railway station, and the travel special is convenient. The surrounding environment is also good. There are public security departments, provincial committees, and people feel very safe. The hotel service is also very good. I put the necklace next to the TV.When I left, I forgot to take it. When I checkout, the waiter reminded me gentlely and moved me very much. It is a good hotel. I suggest you go to Changsha to choose this hotel to try.Supplementary comment on July 2, 2008: When I used to stay in the hotel with friends before, the breakfast was located on the negative first floor. The environment was not good. This time there was a surprise discovery that the breakfast had moved to the cafe on the first floor. It feels good. It feels good.In general, the hotel is really good. Next time I come to Changsha, I also choose to stay in this hotel."
1,酒店位置不错，设施比较齐全；价格较高，停车不太方便而且收费高。,"The hotel location is good, the facilities are relatively complete; the price is high, the parking is not convenient and the charge is high."
0,"作为一个5星级酒店,四百多元的价格，性价比太差了。房内连小小的鞋拔也没有，浴衣也没有，但浴室内有二只小飞虫在飞，水斗有裂缝，根本不象五星级的酒店。前台领班模样的冷冰冰的。宾馆内设施已有别人评价了，不再发表了。携程网页上介绍“太仓花园酒店还拥有一应俱全的健身娱乐设施和配套服务”确实如此，从宾馆外观来看，宾馆主业可能在这里。","As a 5 -star hotel, the price of more than 400 yuan is too bad.There are no small shoes in the room, and there are no bathrobes, but there are two small flying worms in the bathroom, and the water buckets are cracks, which is not like a five -star hotel at all.The front desk leaders look cold.The facilities in the hotel have been evaluated and no longer published.The Ctrip web introduction ""Taicang Garden Hotel also has all -in -one fitness and entertainment facilities and supporting services"" is indeed the case. From the perspective of the hotel's appearance, the main industry may be here."
0,唯一优势是位置。房间太小，过道太窄，隔音太差，加上卫生间漏水到地板，价格却比汉庭高出近100元，实在不值。,"The only advantage is the location.The room is too small, the aisle is too narrow, the sound insulation is too poor, and the toilet leaks to the floor, the price is nearly 100 yuan higher than the Hang court, which is not worth it."
1,一般，没有特别的独到之处。价格方面也没有太多的优惠，反正总体来说，就是一般一般啦,"Generally, there is no special uniqueness.There are not many discounts in terms of price, anyway, in general, it is generally"
1,住中天也不是一次两次了，觉得不错才继续住的，这次回国在重庆转机，而且离车站又近，又是购物中心，所以这次仍然又选择住在中天，但是这次发生了件超不爽的事情，当天下午到达中天后，我们就去吃东西了，当天，重庆下着雨，天气变凉，就打开旅行箱加了件衣服，因为想到说一会儿就回来了，旅行箱就没有锁起来，结果等回到酒店后，酒店内已经有人来过了（出去的时候门是锁好的哦），而且里面添加了两瓶水（应该是服务生进来的），结果再看旅行箱，电话记事本竖着放在旅行箱拉口处，东西翻得乱七八糟的，倒还好，我给爸妈从美国带的保健品--老人服用的善存带的五瓶却少了一瓶，钱倒没有多少，200左右，但是超不爽的~建议酒店，下次在客人进住安排服务生把所有的东西都弄好，不要在客人入住后外出的情况下，让服务生单独进入房间，发生这样的事情对谁都不好，钱倒是小事，但是都从美国带回重庆了，结果就这样不见了，特郁闷~~~~~当然酒店其它方面还是不错的，下次还会选择入住，但是就是记得带把锁~~,"Living in Zhongtian is not once or twice. I feel good to continue. This time I returned to China to turn in Chongqing, and it was close to the station.After arriving in Zhongtian in the afternoon of the same day, we went to eat.

0,不喜欢这个酒店，感觉同它的星级相差很远：1。没有门童，没人会来帮你提行李。2。前台态度冷漠，口气太生硬。3。我刚办了入住，把我的房号写错，害我提着行李上上下下的跑。4。自说自话把我同事的订单取消，携程出面交涉没有结果，很强硬。5。大堂太小，搞了些电脑让人上网。有些不象住店客人的人在那里上网，乌烟瘴气，像网吧。6。自以为聪明的推出了很多所谓的服务，但一般我们用不到。相反却完全不能给客人温馨的感觉。7。相对它的服务，这个价格太贵了！真不知道这样的酒店在奥运后怎样生存。。。,"I don't like this hotel, it feels far from its star grade: 1.There are no door children, no one will come to help you with luggage.2.The front desk was indifferent and his tone was too hard.3.I just got in my check -in and wrote my room number wrongly, which hurt me to run up and down with my luggage.4.I said that I had canceled my colleagues' orders. Ctrip had no results, and it was tough.5.The lobby is too small, and some computers make people go online.Some people who are not like the guests in the store are there, and the smoke is angry, like an Internet cafe.6.I thought it was smart to launch a lot of so -called services, but generally we can't use it.On the contrary, it cannot give guests a warm feeling.7.Compared to its service, this price is too expensive!I really don't know how such a hotel survives after the Olympics.EssenceEssence"
1,"因这酒店不在市区,所以总体服务环境还可以,但二楼吃饭的餐厅有点贵了.","Because the hotel is not in the urban area, the overall service environment is okay, but the restaurant on the second floor is a bit expensive."
0,第一次来，主要是贪便宜，然后因为事多就没去找其它酒店了，住着住着也就习惯了，服务员都会跟你打招呼，前台服务员有的好有的差，好的还不错，差的就没话说了，住的单人房，窗户关不紧，说是出了事有摄像头，地毯脏的不行，气味严重，前台在六楼，不太方便，早餐不要提了，没法吃，中餐晚餐不提供。每晚都有骚扰电话，决不会没有。空调是中央空调，房内调节器如同摆设，后来找到其它酒店后就搬走了，还是住了十天。,"The first time I came, it was mainly greedy and cheap, and then I did n’t go to other hotels because there were too many things.There is nothing to say about the difference. The single room living is not closed. It is said that there is a camera. The carpet is not dirty. The smell is serious. The front desk is on the sixth floor.Fa eat, Chinese food dinner is not provided.There are harassment calls every night, and never nothing.The air conditioner is a central air conditioner.

1,青山环抱，环境幽雅。服务态度较好，饭菜不贵，味道也不错，水库里的鱼好极了。可以钓鱼，渔友可以带上家伙，多住两天。我这次时间太短，遗憾啊。房间异味较重。,"Surrounded by green mountains, the environment is elegant.The service attitude is good, the food is not expensive, the taste is also good, and the fish in the reservoir is extremely good.You can fish, fishermen can bring the guy for two more days.My time is too short, unfortunately.The room odor is heavier."
1,酒店只有20楼是新装修的，感觉还不错，房间干净，没什么味道。CHECKOUT时看到别人同样房型才250元~~唉，看来携程还是赚了不少滴~~嘿嘿,"The hotel only has a new decoration on the 20th floor. It feels good.

1,交通方便，适合自驾车者，有免费停车场，酒店的餐厅较好，离灵隐寺较近，但酒店的隔音不太好，其他方面都可以。,"Convenient transportation, suitable for self -driving, free parking lots, hotel restaurants are better, closer to Lingyin Temple, but the hotel's sound insulation is not good, and other aspects can be."

0,1前台态度差、一律告知没有标间，而且前台标的优惠价格我看目的就是诱使客人住高标；2房间设施陈旧，维护差，冬季温度上不来，房间骚扰电话频繁。3离店办理手续效率低；我比较了解长春，这个酒店也就是离火车站近一点，其他根本没有优势，而且火车站附近的快捷酒店多的是，推荐选其他的。建议携程清除这家酒店，而且携程应该定期考察、清理一些不合格的酒店，否则影响携程预定的满意度。,"1 The attitude of the front desk is poor, and there is no standard room, and the preferential price of the front desk is to seduce the guests to live a high standard; 2 room facilities are old, poor maintenance, the temperature in winter cannot come, and the room harassment calls are frequent.3 The efficiency of the procedures from the store is low; I know more about Changchun.

1,第二次入住，感觉还行。但3个老外都反映床太硬。另外外面正在施工，机器声音很吵，在我们的要求下给换了房间。早餐和自助晚餐都一般。如果嫌5星酒店的价格太贵的话，可以考虑中油。,"The second time to stay, it feels okay.But all three foreigners reflected that the bed was too hard.In addition, it is under construction outside, and the sound of the machine is very noisy. At our request, we changed the room.Breakfast and buffet dinner are average.If the price of the 5 -star hotel is too expensive, you can consider China Oil."

0,房间条件太差了，完全浪费了紧邻什刹海、北海的有力位置。或许定位就是给那些到此一游的游客服务吧，方方面面条件都相当差，充其量是一个招待所水平。,"The conditions of the room are too poor, and it is completely wasted for the powerful position next to Shichahai and Beihai.Perhaps the positioning is to serve those tourists who travel here. All aspects of the conditions are quite poor. At best, it is a guest house level."
1,"几次入住该酒店都给我一种“顾客是上帝""的感觉，尤其是每次checkin时,接待员万鹏先生给予细致周到的服务,让我们心情非常愉快。这也是我们每次来南京都喜欢住该酒店的原因。我呒向朋友谈了在酒店的情况,他们也表示下次要住该酒店尝试一次.","Several time to stay in the hotel, I gave me a feeling of ""customers are God"", especially every time I checkin, the receptionist Mr. Wan Peng gave meticulous services, making us very happy.This is why we like to live in the hotel every time we come to Nanjing.I talked to my friends about the situation in the hotel, and they also said that the hotel will try again next time."
1,在青岛，这个酒店真的只能说是很一般，位置还可以，但门口非常不好叫车，其实等着很多车但只去机场，市区短途的他们都不去，礼宾部也视而不见。服务来讲在沿海城市的众多酒店中很一般，没什么特色。相信在青岛有很多更好的选择！,"In Qingdao, this hotel can only be said to be very average, and the location is okay, but the door is very difficult to call a car. In fact, they are waiting for a lot of cars but they only go to the airport. They do not go to the short -distance urban area.In terms of services, there are many hotels in coastal cities and have no characteristics.I believe there are many better choices in Qingdao!"
1,交通方便，对面就是国美电器。出入的车辆比较多，又刚好处于路口，所以有点混乱。5楼可以喝晚茶，估计因为这样，所以大堂里面进出的人比较多，显得有点嘈杂。电梯的配置不是很好！,"The transportation is convenient, and the opposite side is Gome Electric.There are more vehicles in and out of the intersection, so it is a bit confusing.You can drink evening tea on the 5th floor. It is estimated that because of this, there are more people in and out of the lobby, and it looks a bit noisy.The configuration of the elevator is not very good!"
1,装修不错，都是新的。服务非常好，很细心周到。在保定，中银的服务给我留下最深刻的印象。然后早餐是自助餐，种类非常多质量也很好。宾馆周边交通也挺方便，宾馆对面就是保定市政府。,"The decoration is good, all new.The service is very good and very careful.In Baoding, BOC's service left me the deepest impression.Then breakfast is a buffet, with a lot of quality and good quality.The traffic around the hotel is also very convenient.

1,非常好的酒店，服务员热情，酒店设施很新，住着舒服，配得上四星级。特别值得推荐的是餐饮很好，不管是堂食还是送餐，味道不错，价格也不贵。以后在去西安就住他家了。补充点评2008年8月10日：再写一点：性价比很高。携程的价格很有优势。,"Very good hotel, the waiter is enthusiastic, the hotel facilities are new, comfortable to live, and it is worthy of four -star.What is particularly recommended is that the catering is very good. Whether it is food or meals, it tastes good and the price is not expensive.I will live in his house in Xi'an in the future.Supplementary comment on August 10, 2008: Write a little bit: cost -effective.Ctrip's price is very advantageous."
1,酒店位置很好，虽然没有海景，但在市政府对面，吃饭、买东西都比较方便。酒店服务人员态度也很好，特别是停车时，酒店门口没车位了，保安还主动带我们把车停到酒店后面。房间里的情况一看就是老四星酒店，设施设备比较齐全，但明显感觉有点旧，地毯也有点脏，刚进房门的时候还有点霉味。因行程关系，只住了一晚，总的来讲基本满意。,"The hotel location is very good. Although there is no sea view, it is more convenient to eat and buy things across the city government.The hotel service staff also has a good attitude, especially when parking, there is no parking space at the hotel door, and the security guard also takes us to park the car behind the hotel.The situation in the room is the old four -star hotel. The facilities and equipment are relatively complete, but it is obviously a bit old, the carpet is a bit dirty, and it is a bit moldy when I first entered the door.Due to the itinerary, I only lived for one night, which was basically satisfied."
0,属于政府招待所，酒店设施非常一般，服务态度也不太令人满意，房间的床上用品不干净，枕套居然是有大面积油渍的，换了一个居然还是一样，床单下有很多头发，被罩上还有零星的血渍，早餐质量太差，天天一样，令人没有食欲，18元的早餐也就是喝碗粥，吃个鸡蛋。希望邯郸地区的酒店能够尽量提高质量和服务水平,"It belongs to the government's hospitality, the hotel facilities are very general, the service attitude is not satisfactory. The bedding in the room is not clean. The pillow sleeve actually has a large area of oil stains.There are sporadic blood stains, the quality of breakfast is too poor, and every day, there is no appetite. Breakfast for 18 yuan is to drink bowl porridge and eat eggs.It is hoped that hotels in Handan areas can try to improve quality and service level as much as possible"
0,"非常的差,定的是豪华套房可是给我的感觉是刚刚做过真空处理,什么都没有真的很差服务方面就更不用说了我在","Very bad, it is determined that the luxury suite is given to me that I have just done vacuum treatment, and nothing is really bad."
1,"我因工作需要长期出差。自2006年12月，每周都要到杭州几天，曾先后住过维景国际、马可波罗假日、中山国际、华美达海华、最佳西方瑞丰格琳、龙禧商务等酒店，但最终把杭州的商务、旅游住宿锁定在最佳西方梅苑宾馆，至今已有一年有余。原因就在于此酒店的性价比太高了，我亲身的经历：刚第一次晚上入住，只认为四星、全球最大的连锁酒店没什么与众不同，但第二天楼层接待、大堂副理、楼层服务员都知道我的姓名，使人感到有很大的亲切感，这种VIP待遇只有在国外四星级以上、国内个别五星级VIP客人才会享受得到的。补充点评2008年6月4日：姓名杨琥，联系方式MAIL:yang-hu-@163,参加“细节感动浙江”活动","I need to travel for a long time due to work.Since December 2006, I have been to Hangzhou a few days a week. I have lived in hotels such as Weida International, Marco Polo Holiday, Zhongshan International, Huameda Haihua, Best Western Ruifeng Gelin, Longxi Business and other hotels, but in the endHangzhou's business and travel accommodation are locked at the best Western Meiyuan Hotel. It has been more than a year.The reason is that the hotel's cost performance is too high. My personal experience: I just stayed in the evening, I only thought that the four stars and the world's largest chain hotels were not different, but the next day the floor reception, the deputy manager of the lobby, the floor of the floor, the floor of the floor, the floor of the floor, the floorThe waiters know my name and make people feel a lot of intimacy.

1,这次因工作需要又一次预定这里，当我到都江堰城时感到地震给都江堰带来的破坏，曾经繁华的城市，而今……！来到二王庙宾馆的时候，使我惊奇的是这里的现状真的感觉不到这家宾馆是经历了地震的，当我进到房间时发现房间和以住依旧，也可以说在这儿不怎么找得到地震后的痕迹，与我同行的同事也觉得奇妙。我们在房间美美的睡了一晚，第二天用完早餐便离开了，虽然这次停留时间短暂，但让我感到欣慰的是：这时里的服务还是和以前一样，周到、细致，员工脸上的笑容依旧那么的温馨与热情，看来要常订这里了！,"This time, I reserved here again due to work needs. When I arrived at Dujiangyan City, I felt the damage caused by the earthquake to Dujiangyan, the once bustling city, and now ...!When I came to the Erwang Temple Hotel, I was surprised that the status quo here really didn't feel that this hotel experienced the earthquake. When I entered the room, I found that the room and lived still.How to find the traces after the earthquake, and my colleagues with me also felt wonderful.We slept in the room for a night, and after using breakfast the next day, we left. Although the stay time is short, what makes me feel relieved: at this time, the service in this time is still the same as before, thoughtful, meticulous, employees, and employeesThe smile on the face is still so warm and enthusiastic, it seems that it is often booked here!"
0,预订标准间：拐角房间（为什么携程订的都是拐角间），房间很小，隔音超差，房间非常冷，空调几乎不好用，卫生间更冷，几乎没法淋浴！三个字＂不满意＂！,"Booking standard room: The corner room (why Ctrip is booked a corner room). The room is small, the sound insulation is super poor, the room is very cold, the air conditioner is almost difficult to use, the bathroom is colder, and the shower is almost impossible!Three words ""dissatisfied""!"
1,我是07年8月27-29日入住这个酒店的。酒店的2名行李员的服务很好，让我们留下了深刻的印象。第一个行李员MR.KENNTH，在我们抵店起，就表现的十分的专业、热情、有礼貌、细心。第二个行李员MR.KEN，由于我们对于HK的小街道不是很熟悉，所以无法精确的知道，在哪个地铁的出口出，才是最近的。他很耐心的为我们提供服务，为我们在找路时，节省了很多时间。但前台的服务就不是很理想。很由于他们的服务都很好，所以我特意写了表扬信给他们，以示感谢！,"I entered the hotel on August 27-29, 2007.The service of the two luggles in the hotel is very good, and we have a deep impression.The first luggage MR.Kennth, when we arrived at the store, we showed very professional, enthusiastic, polite, and careful.The second luggage MR.Ken, because we are not familiar with HK's small streets, we cannot know precisely that the exit of which subway is the closest.He patiently provided us with services, saving a lot of time when we were looking for ways.But the service in the front desk is not ideal.Because their services are very good, I specially wrote a letter of praise to them to show my gratitude!"
1,"总体还行,只是让人觉得不像4星级酒店.设施及环境还是差了点.价格也偏高.不过房间还是很舒服的,面积也很大.点评者","The overall is okay, it just makes people feel like a 4 -star hotel. The facilities and environment are still a bit worse. The price is also high. However, the room is still very comfortable and the area is very large."
1,这也能叫四星酒店？不值。只是地理位置还算方便吧。,Can this be called the four -star hotel?not worth.It's just that the geographical location is pretty convenient.
0,洗澡竟然没有热水！！太郁闷了~~第二天还要爬山啊！！不过网速还可以~,There is no hot water in the bath!IntersectionIt's so depressed ~~ I have to climb the mountain the next day!IntersectionBut the network speed is okay ~
0,本来在莫太住的好好的，结果在网上看到这个宾馆就换了，结果让我很后悔。宾馆缺乏服务意识，我进门的时候门童在门口靠着，也不会对客人说一句你好，宾馆里的服务员也很冷漠，让我有点不舒服，房间里有网线，不过我打电话拿网线给我一根很短的，还和我说让我将就用，而且网线还时断时续，打给服务员，他鼓捣鼓捣就有了，早上起来就又断了，于是我只住了一天就搬走了。房间来说应该还算干净，但是离商业区较远，楼下是广场所以比较吵。总之，因为服务问题，我不推荐这家店，真的不如去秋林附件的莫太呢,"I was very good at Mo Tai, but I changed to see the hotel on the Internet. As a result, I regret it.The hotel lacks a sense of service. When I entered the door, the door child leaned at the door, and would not say hello to the guests. The waiter in the hotel was very indifferent and made me a little uncomfortable. There was a network line in the room, but I called to get it to get it, but I called to get it to get it.The network cable gave me a very short one, and told me that I will use it, and the network cable is also intermittent, and the waiter will be made.I moved away a day.The room should be clean, but it is far from the commercial area.In short, because of service problems, I don’t recommend this shop. It's really better to go to Mo Tai who goes to Qiulin's attachment."
0,"入住时酒店的服务很好，大堂和房间一般，入住后发现房间的硬件较差，比如空调，马桶，尤其是电视遥控器非常差，几乎不能用。房间空调不管用，走廊也有味道。早餐很差，刚到九点服务员就疯狂地收东西，也不问一问客人是否还需要，很差，曾经看到的评价不太确切，第二天立刻搬到龙城，山西真的是没有什么好的宾馆,不知道为什么，很奇怪！","The hotel's service is very good when check -in. The lobby and room are average. After check -in, I found that the hardware in the room was poor, such as air conditioning, toilet, especially the TV remote control, and it was almost unavailable.The room air conditioner does not work, and the corridor also tastes.Breakfast is very bad. As soon as the waiter arrived at 9 o'clock, he accepted Dongxi crazy, and did not ask the guests if he still needed it. It was very bad. The evaluation that I had seen was not accurate. Immediately moved to Longcheng the next day.There are no good hotels, I don't know why, it's strange!"
1,房间环境很干净，就是地方不算是特别好找，呵呵。,"The room environment is very clean, but the place is not particularly easy to find, haha."
0,隔音效果非常非常非常的差，睡在房间里象睡在马路边一样，路上声音听的清清楚楚。我还是看了携程上该酒店的点评，采纳网友意见预定了5楼以上的房间。结果还是非常的吵，到晚上12点还是睡不着，只好打开电视以掩盖马路上的车声。不知道几点睡着了，一大早就被车声吵醒，一看表，才早上4点！才4点啊，也就是说就算晚上12点我睡着了，也才睡了4个小时。头疼啊，白天还要工作啊，闭上眼睛努力睡，怎么样也睡不着啊，太吵了。坚持到5：30实在是受不了了，打电话给前台，问有没有安静点的房间可以换，现在不能换晚上换也可以，答曰：没有。盯着天花板熬到6：30，起床。在早餐厅灌了3杯咖啡后，马上去退房。本来是要住三天的，实在是受不了这个吵啊。真不明白这样差的条件怎么在携程上有4.0的评分。另：1.电视播放太复杂，不方便2.服务员服务意识不强，没有为客人着想、以解决问题为本的意识。体现在早餐券、开发票等问题上3、网线太短，大概就20厘米长吧，不能在床上上网4.电源接触不好，电脑电源连到插座上时火花噼里啪啦的冒，当时我想：因为电源问题损坏电脑不知道酒店赔不赔再次表示疑问：这样的酒店上怎么会有4、0的高分数，宾馆反馈2008年3月30日：首先感谢您的入住并提出宝贵的意见，由于房间的环境问题影响到您的休息为此我们深表歉意。对于您提出的一些问题，我们会酌情整改，另外酒店早餐是凭房卡用的，没有早餐券；我们客房中心随时都为一些有特殊要求的客人准备了较长的网线，如果有需要只要一个电话，马上送到房间。非常感谢您的宝贵意见，真诚期待您能再次光临，给我们一个能为您提供更好服务的机会。,"The sound insulation effect is very, very poor, sleeping in the room like sleeping on the side of the road, and the sound on the road is clear.I still read the review of the hotel on Ctrip, and adopted the opinions of netizens to book a room on the 5th floor.As a result, it was very noisy. By 12 pm, he couldn't sleep, so he had to turn on the TV to cover up the sound of the car on the road.I don't know if I fell asleep, I was awakened by the sound of the car early in the morning. At a glance, it was only 4 o'clock in the morning!Only 4 o'clock, that is, even if I fell asleep at 12 pm, I fell asleep for 4 hours.He has a headache. I still have to work during the day. Close my eyes and try hard to sleep. I ca n’t sleep, so noisy.I can't stand it until 5:30. I called the front desk and asked if there was a quiet room to change it. Now I ca n’t change it at night.Staring at the ceiling until 6:30, get up.After breaking 3 cups of coffee in the breakfast room, go out immediately.I was going to live for three days. I couldn't stand this noise.I really don't understand how this poor condition has a 4.0 score on Ctrip.Another: 1. The TV playback is too complicated, and it is not convenient. 2. The awareness of the waiter's service is not strong, and there is no consciousness for customers to think and solve the problem.It is reflected in issues such as breakfast vouchers, invoices, etc. 3. The network cable is too short. It is about 20 cm long. You cannot access the Internet on the bed 4. The power supply is not good.Because the power problem is damaged, the computer does not know that the hotel compensation does not compensate again to express doubts again: How can there be a high score of 4 or 0 on this hotel, the hotel feedback on March 30, 2008: First of all, thank you for your stay and put forward valuable opinions. Due to your valuable opinions, becauseThe environmental problems in the room affect your rest for this. We apologize.For some of the problems you raised, we will rectify as appropriate. In addition, the hotel breakfast is used by the house card, and there is no breakfast coupon; our room center has prepared a long network cable for some guests with special requirements.Telephone, send it to the room immediately.Thank you very much for your valuable opinions. I sincerely look forward to your visit again and give us an opportunity to provide you with better service."
1,阳台观景不错，可惜房间内设施很一般。没有地毯只是地砖铺设，床也比较硬。尤其是厕所，散发了一个晚上的味道。。。感觉只有三星的水平，不过酒店前台的寄存服务还可以。,"The balcony view is good, but unfortunately the facilities in the room are very average.No carpet is just laid on the floor tiles, and the bed is relatively hard.Especially the toilet, exuding a night's taste.EssenceEssenceIt feels only the level of Samsung, but the storage service of the hotel's front desk is okay."
1,每次重庆出差，基本上都住雾都宾馆，宾馆很温馨，服务周到，价格合适，交通方便......各方面都不错，下次去还会住雾都宾馆！,"Every time in Chongqing's business trips, I basically stay in the Wudu Hotel. The hotel is very warm, the service is thoughtful, the price is appropriate, the transportation is convenient ... I will live in the Wusu Hotel next time!"
1,房间很大，服务员的态度也很好。只是商场在招商，不是很方便！,"The room is very large, and the waiter's attitude is also very good.It's just that the mall is not very convenient!"
1,中福我已住了三次，次感差。我是12:00Checkin后，到下午2:00才入住，但是屋後床是等待修理。客人已登入住，二小後有理好房，客服的品是有的。如果不是中福位置方便，其房服人的品是要提升的。否的店在同等位上，中福客源被走。,"I have lived three times in Zhongfu.After I was 12: 00Checkin, I stayed at 2:00 pm, but the bed was waiting to be repaired.The guests have been checked in. After the second primary school, there is a good house, and the customer service is available.If it was not for the convenience of Zhongfu, the quality of the house service would be improved.In terms of the same place, Zhongfuke was taken away."
1,"办理入住很快,感受的是梦幻般的童话世界.大厅持续播放着迪斯尼的经典动画片，空中飘荡着迪斯尼的经典旋律。海蓝色是主色调，米奇头像是主元素。大巴是海蓝色的底色，上面画满了迪斯尼的动物明星；酒店外墙是海蓝色的，窗户的形状是米奇，椅子的扶手是米奇，电梯间的按钮也是米奇，镜子里刻的还是米奇，到处是米奇的身影,到处是孩子的笑声。房间很大，很整洁，一次性纸拖鞋上也印着米奇头像，包装袋上还注明：这是酒店送给您的礼物，请把它带回家吧！海景房风景不错，窗外是海，还可远眺五星级的迪斯尼乐园酒店。内设游泳池，带温泉，对入住酒店的客人免费开放，当天晚上没有去泡真是可惜，第二天一早赶紧补上。","I handled it quickly, and I felt the dreamy fairy tale world. The hall continued to play Disney's classic cartoons, and Disney's classic melody was floating in the air.Sea blue is the main color, Mickey's avatars are the main element.The bus is a sea blue background, which is covered with Disney's animal stars; the exterior wall of the hotel is sea blue, the shape of the window is Mickey, the handrail of the chair is Mickey, the elevator room button is also Mickey, the mirror is engraved with Mickey., Mickey's figure everywhere, the laughter of children everywhere.The room is very large and neat. There are also Mickey avatars on disposable paper slippers. The packaging bag also indicates: This is a gift given to you by the hotel. Please take it home!The scenery of the sea view room is good, the sea is the sea, and the five -star Disneyland Hotel can be overlooking.There are swimming pools, with hot springs, and free opening for guests who are staying in the hotel. It is a pity not to go to soak that night."
0,酒店环境不好，气氛也不好，我和老婆刚刚住进去就有小姐打电话来问要不要特殊服务，真是恐怖，老婆说啥也不住在那边了，最后，我勉强说服老婆住了一晚上，但是到了后来，更是恐怖，居然没有开水供应，然后，还要自己烧水，但是烧水壶居然已经长了毛，后来有个服务员勉强给换了一个，但是还是这样，我当时不知道该说什么好，最后我们买的矿泉水，勉强对付了,"The hotel's environment is not good and the atmosphere is not good. My wife and I just came in and asked the lady to ask if they wanted to serve special services. It was terrible. My wife said that she couldn't live there. Finally, I barely convinced my wife to live inOne night, but later, it was even more horrible. There was no boiling water supply. Then, I had to burn the water by myself, but the kettle was already grown. Later, a waiter barely changed one, but this was the case.Knowing what to say, the mineral water we bought in the end barely deal with"
0,这家酒店我非常的不满意，原因有三。第一：结帐时拒开发票，服务员说要开发票必须交四元钱，不然不开，我们严厉斥责他们公然逃税！！她们无话可说，可最终还是收了我们一元钱才给开的发票，因为赶火车，不然一定追究到底！！第二：酒店没有楼梯，必须自己走上去，非常累，而且酒店说是准三星，问他们那牌照呢？回答：还没发下来。第三：418房间的饮水器非常的脏，我们把水桶拆下来，洗了半天，里面都是灰！,"I am very dissatisfied with this hotel for three reasons.First: refuse to invoiced during checkout. The waiter said that the invoicing must be paid four yuan, otherwise we will not open it. We have severely rebuked them for public tax evasion!IntersectionThey had nothing to say, but in the end, the invoices we gave for one yuan were still collected, because the train was rushing to the end!IntersectionSecond: The hotel has no stairs. You must go up by yourself. It is very tired, and the hotel is quasi -Samsung. Ask them?Answer: Before it is sent out.Third: The drinking water heater in Room 418 is very dirty. We removed the bucket and washed for a long time."
0,很失望。不过也很正常，因为在北京这个价格就是这样的住宿条件。宾馆的建筑好像和商务楼连接在一起的，4部电梯用一道墙隔开，2部商务楼用，2部住宿用。房间毫无享受的感觉，也就住一天凑合。周边也没有什么餐饮和超市，不太方便。,"Very disappointed.But it is also normal, because the price in Beijing is such a accommodation condition.The building of the hotel seems to be connected to the commercial building. Four elevators are separated by one wall, 2 commercial buildings, and 2 stays.There is no feeling of enjoyment in the room, so I live together for a day.There are no restaurants and supermarkets around, which is not convenient."
0,去年圣诞节前去香港由于航班原因临时在汉普顿加了一晚上，体会如下：1.在寸土寸金的香港这个价格还算过得去。2.除了大堂，房间设施实在是和我“想象”中的“酒店”有较大距离。3.所有摆设，包括杯子、床单、椅子都是宜家的，但问题是实在太旧了。4.我预定的3间房都很小，基本上只能放2个床（床大概1.8m0.9m），一个小电视机柜（电视是18寸左右的，我家上次用这种款式的估计实在20年前），剩余的地方正好给你竖着放两个旅行箱。5.最经典的莫过于我婆婆进她的单人房时，以为是进了一个“壁橱”，她的床是两头顶的（床头在窗口，床尾在门口）。其实我们也是有心理准备的，关键是在checkin时前台态度很好、很客气的说：我们已经尽量为你们准备了最大的房间～～～6.卫生间很小，小到正好放一个马桶、一个水斗、一根冲淋管，PS：没有镜子。7.没有窗帘，只有关不拢的铝合金百叶窗。总结来讲，我很佩服他们，能真正做到“麻雀虽小，五脏俱全”……至少还不至于让我无法入睡。,"I went to Hong Kong before Christmas last Christmas. I temporarily added one night in Hampton due to flight reasons. I realized as follows: 1. The price of Hong Kong in Hong Kong is still too much.2. Except for the lobby, the room facilities are really far from the ""hotel"" in my ""imagination"".3. All furnishings, including cups, sheets, and chairs are IKEA, but the problem is that it is too old.4. The three rooms I booked are very small, and basically only 2 beds (about 1.8m0.9m) can be placed (about 1.8m0.9m). A small TV cabinet (TV is about 18 inches. My family used this style to estimate this style.Twenty years ago), the remaining places are just giving you two suitcases.5. When my mother -in -law entered her single room, the most classic one thought that she had entered a ""closet"". Her bed was above the two ends (the bedside was at the window, the end of the bed was at the door).In fact, we are also psychologically prepared. The key is that when Checkin, the front desk is very good and politely said: We have tried to prepare the largest room for you ~~~ 6. The bathroom is very small.Water bucket, a gonorrhea, PS: No mirror.7. There are no curtains, only aluminum alloy blossoms.In summary, I admire them very much that I can truly achieve ""the sparrows are small, all the internal organs are all"" ... at least not to make me unable to fall asleep."

1,房间还不错，挺大的，早餐一般。酒店周围环境还可以，吃饭比较方便，正如之前的客人所介绍的，酒店也不知道是该叫前面还是后面的，有几个饭店可以吃饭。也是赞同关于之前的点评中的意见，为什么不送饮用水啊，现在国内很少有酒店不送饮用水的,"The room is not bad, quite big, breakfast is average.The environment around the hotel is okay. Eating is more convenient. As the previous guests introduced, the hotel does not know whether it should be called the front or the back. There are several restaurants to eat.I also agree with the opinions of the previous reviews. Why not send drinking water? There are few hotels in China not send drinking water."

1,第2次入住该酒店。总体还是不错就是不能免费提供宽带上网服务。宽带上网价格高的离谱50元1天。着不是可以承受的价格。总体还不错,"Check in the hotel for the second time.Overall is still good, it cannot provide broadband Internet services for free.Broadband Internet price is out of 50 yuan 1 day.It is not an affordable price.Overall pretty good"

0,价格贵，房间设施老旧，居然没有电梯。房间大，但都是没有用的设施，比如麻将桌，又占地方，又没用。热水器插座就设在花洒上方，感觉不安全。,"The price is expensive, the room facilities are old, and there are no elevators.The rooms are large, but they are all useless facilities, such as Mahjong tables, and they are useless.The water heater socket is located above the shower, and it feels unsafe."

Hotel feedback on May 5, 2008: First of all, thank you very much for staying at our hotel.We are very sorry for the engineering noise you encountered during your stay in the sea view room.Since there is a commercial house next to the hotel, it has a impact on your sleep. We must try to contact the construction unit as much as possible and ask them to regulate working hours.At the same time, I hope you can stay in our hotel again.Finally, I am sorry for your encounter again."
0,房间卫生极差，登记时，前台服务小姐爱理不理，还扬言她们是私营老板....怎样怎样.....洗完手发现鞋已经湿了，检查后发现，水池管是露的，上边放水，下边都流出来了，房间窗户无法打开通气，屋内极为干燥。前一天同事喝矿泉水，娃哈哈外塑料商标掉在地上了，两天过去了，打扫后的房间里，那张塑料皮仍然原封不动地放在门口处，不知道服务员是不是诚心的。一点都没看出来达到这个住宿的价格标准。要不是开会对方指定住这，打死都不来这。,"The room is extremely poor. During the registration, the lady of the front desk service lady ignored it, and she threatened that they were private bosses ... how to do ..... After washing my hands, I found that the shoes were wet.In the upper water, it flowed out of the bottom. The windows of the room could not be opened, and the room was extremely dry.The day before, my colleagues drank mineral water. Wahaha's plastic trademark fell to the ground. Two days passed. In the cleaning room, the plastic skin was still placed at the door. I don't know if the waiter was sincere.I didn't see the price standard of this accommodation at all.If it weren't for the meeting to stay here, wouldn't he come here."
1,酒店离毛主席故居、毛主席铜像广场都比较近，各方面都还不错，希望以后能够开通宽带,"The hotel is relatively close to Chairman Mao's former residence and Chairman Mao's bronze statue square, and all aspects are good. I hope to open broadband in the future"
1,我们五一期间去了一次洛阳和郑州，房间机票都是通过携程预定的。决定住拙耕园宾馆，也是看了很多评价以后才决定的。但因为没有特别关照要靠学院的房间，所以给了一个靠马路这边的，而且是靠电梯口的房间，所以感觉不是很安静。宾馆的地理位置是不错，如果要去龙门石窟的话，宾馆对面坐公交车就可以直接到，很方便。我们感觉宾馆的房间不小，但是感觉比较陈旧，地毯上有烟头的洞，洗手间也很旧的感觉。房间里没有小冰箱，而且也不提供水，要喝水得自己烧自来水，很不方便，连一般的连锁酒店也不如的感觉。且开门进房间有股味道，好像很久没有通风的感觉。前台服务员态度比较好，但是checkin的速度很慢，我们用护照登记的，两个大人带一个孩子三本护照都要一一填写单子，而且还都要复印，这还是我们出行第一次遇到这样的事情，一般酒店填写一份就行了，护照也不要复印。早餐虽然比较便宜，但是没什么可吃的感觉。我们中午在宾馆餐厅用餐，感觉比较贵，而且吃不完的菜他们就给一个薄薄的塑料袋打包，连一个打包盒子什么的也没有，有点诧异。补充点评2008年5月8日：怎么给了一个4分，我想打三分的。,"We went to Luoyang and Zhengzhou during May 1st, and the room tickets were booked through Ctrip.It was decided to decide to stay in the Humble Garden Hotel.However, because there is no special care to depend on the school's room, it is given a room that rely on the road, and it is a room with the elevator mouth, so it feels not very quiet.The geographical location of the hotel is good. If you want to go to Longmen Grottoes, you can get directly from the bus opposite the hotel, which is very convenient.We feel that the room of the hotel is not small, but it feels old. There are cigarette buttons on the carpet, and the toilet is also very old.There is no small refrigerator in the room, and it does not provide water. It is inconvenient to drink water to boil water. It is not convenient to drink it.And the opening of the door has a taste, it seems that there is no sense of ventilation for a long time.The front desk waiter has a good attitude, but the speed of Checkin is very slow. We register with a passport. The two adults take a child with three passports one by one, and they have to copy.Such a thing, just fill in one copy of the hotel, and do not copy your passport.Although breakfast is cheaper, there is nothing to eat.We dine at the hotel and restaurant at noon. It feels more expensive, and they can't eat a thin plastic bag for the endless dishes. Even a pack box is not surprised.Supplementary comment May 8, 2008: How to give a 4 points, I want to score three points."
1,酒店服务还行，就是房间隔音效果不太好。房间内的电视具有数字功能，断电后重启不便。,"The hotel service is OK, that is, the sound insulation effect of the room is not very good.The TV in the room has digital functions, and it is inconvenient to restart after power failure."
1,"入住了一晚.很不错的酒店,不管是环境设施都很不错,特别是客房里的一些小细节,让人住着觉得比较舒服、方便,要是价格再大众化点相信是一家不错的酒店！","I stayed in the night. The very good hotel, whether the environmental facilities are very good, especially some small details in the rooms, make people feel more comfortable and convenient. If the price is popular, I believe it is a good hotel!"
1,环境很好，地点很方便，服务也很好，下回还会住的！,"The environment is very good, the location is very convenient, the service is very good, and will live next time!"
0,根本提不上4星，不知是谁评的级。前台服务态度很差，Checkin的时候，前台小姐已与前面的两位客人发生争执了，也不为自己的态度而抱歉，并把我凉了10几分钟，问另一小姐为什么不给我登记，她的理由是“我以为你是和他们一起的”晕。。。房间费用是768/night，与房间设施实在差距甚远，连个亮一点的吊灯都没有，全是昏暗的房头灯，弄得心情特郁闷。隔音设施也太差，早上6点多，马路的车水马龙的声音吵到无法入睡了。所谓的早餐，真是不知道该怎么形容了，总共就那么几样，能吃的就只有2到3样了，餐厅的服务生更有意思，不知是不是热情过度，你还在吃着，但盘子里剩的东西已不多，她们就老来收你的碗，也不问你是否还需要，感觉像厨房里少了盘子，急着回收。总之一点，不论是设施或服务，根本就只有3星。,"I can't mention 4 stars at all, I don't know who commented.The front desk service attitude is very poor. When checking, the front desk lady has argued with the two guests in front, and I am not sorry for my own attitude. I took me a cold for 10 minutes and asked why the other lady did not register for me.Her reason was ""I thought you were with them"" dizzy.EssenceEssenceThe cost of the room is 768/night, which is far from the room facilities. There is no light chandelier. It is all dim room headlights, which makes it very depressed.The sound insulation facilities were too poor. At 6 o'clock in the morning, the voice of the road on the road was so noisy that he couldn't fall asleep.The so -called breakfast, I really don’t know how to describe it. There are a few in total, only 2 to 3 can be eaten. The waiter in the restaurant is more interesting. I don’t know if it is too enthusiastic.There are not many leftovers, and they will always collect your bowls, and do not ask if you still need it. It feels like a plate in the kitchen and is anxious to recycle.In short, whether it is facilities or services, there are only 3 stars."
1,开始预定的无烟房，到checkin时却告知无烟房没有了，晚上11点钟了，只能入住。其他服务还行。另外的问题时窗子总会发出卡他卡他声，晚上特别明显。如果是单身女人入住会被吓死的。另餐厅自助餐种类太少了。,"The smokingless house began to start, but I told the smokeless house when I went tockin. At 11 o'clock in the evening, I could only stay.Other services are okay.In addition, the window will always make a card of Kata, which is particularly obvious at night.If a single woman check -in, it will be scared.There are too few types of buffets in restaurants."
1,"是冲着万豪的名气去的,但有点失望,酒店出了位置不错以外,其他都表现平平,特别是房间的装修已显老态,希望酒店当局早点更新,不然很对不起那八百多一晚的房价(还没有早餐).","It was going to Marriott's reputation, but a little disappointed. In addition to the good location of the hotel, other performances were mediocre, especially the decoration of the room was old. I hope the hotel authorities will update early. OtherwiseHouse prices (no breakfast yet)."
1,"优点:1.环境优雅,绿化很好2.服务员很热情3.免费接送机服务缺点:1.按摩电话太多2.没有瓶装矿泉水建议:1.首次入住提供水果2.提供免费瓶装矿泉水","Advantages: 1. Elegant environment, good greening 2. The waiter is very enthusiastic 3. Free shuttle service disadvantages: 1. There are too many massage calls 2. No bottle mineral water suggestion: 1. First check in to provide fruit 2. Provide free bottle mineral water"
1,地理位置不错，在商业街上，逛街很方便，房间也还不错，看上去还比较新，就是早餐品种太少了。酒店旁边的小巷里傍晚开始会出现几个小吃摊，味道都还不错哦，烧烤鱿鱼特别好吃，入住酒店的朋友可以去吃吃看，呵呵。,"The geographical location is good. On commercial streets, shopping is very convenient, the room is not bad, it looks relatively new, that is, there are too few breakfast varieties.There will be a few snack stalls in the alley next to the hotel in the evening. The taste is not bad. The barbecue squid is particularly delicious. Friends who stay in the hotel can eat and eat, huh."
1,赞：地理位置不错，离春熙路近且在府南河边，环境好。早餐很棒！价格合理。憾：设施较陈旧。补充点评2008年2月11日：性价比很高的酒店！,"Praise: The geographical location is good, near Chunxi Road and on the south river of the Fu, the environment is good.Breakfast is great!The price is reasonable.Regret: The facilities are more outdated.Supplementary comment on February 11, 2008: Hotels with high cost performance!"
1,房间设施难以够得上五星级，服务还不错，有送水果。,"The room facilities are difficult to get five -star, and the service is not bad. There are fruits."
0,在南阳，现在还是独此一家，没得选择，当然，去第二次时就有得选择了，希望携程加油把南阳其他的酒店也加上来。金凯悦东方的价格太贵，与南阳的物价水平相差太远。而且给携程留的房间全是拐角处的边角料，实在恼火，总是有种被别人压着住的感觉，一点上帝的感觉都找不到。总之，烂！！！！！！！！服务，烂！！！！！！,"In Nanyang, I still have this unique family. I have no choice. Of course, I have to choose when I go to the second time. I hope Ctrip will add other hotels in Nanyang.Kim Hyatt's Eastern prices are too expensive, which is too far from Nanyang's price level.And the room left to Ctrip is all the corners at the corner, which is really annoyed. There is always a feeling of being pressed by others.In short, rotten!IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionServices, rotten!IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersection"
0,酒店设备一般，套房里卧室的不能上网，要到客厅去。千万不要到酒店的餐厅吃饭，价钱贵不说了，态度极差，端上来菜竟然是冷的，上来的米饭也是冷的，要求他们热一下竟然和我们理论！！下次肯定不会住了！,"The hotel equipment is average, and the bedroom in the suite cannot go online, and go to the living room.Don't eat at the restaurant in the hotel. The price is expensive. The attitude is very poor. It is cold when the dishes are brought up.IntersectionI will definitely not live next time!"
0,有些差就和小旅店差不多离机场还有一些距离不建议去住,Some differences are almost the same as the shops and there are some distances from the airport.
1,环境还算可以，但出入不是很方便。其它配套设备还过得去吧。,"The environment is okay, but it is not very convenient to enter and exit.Other supporting devices have to live."
1,很好的酒店，性价比很好，房间面积也不小。卫生间也很清爽明亮，让人感觉很舒服。下次来上海肯定还会住这的，实际上我来上海基本上住2家酒店，一家是香港广场，一家就是粤海了。香港广场价格高很多，粤海价格适中。,"A very good hotel, the price is good, and the room area is not small.The bathroom is also refreshing and bright, making people feel comfortable.Next time I come to Shanghai, I will definitely live here. In fact, I basically stay in Shanghai to stay in two hotels, one is Hong Kong Square, and the other is Yuehai.The price of Hong Kong square is much higher, and the price of Guangdong is moderate."
1,性价比挺高的一家酒店。我在网上订的是普通标房，到那边他们给我的房间好象是豪华标房。挺好的，有一个阳台，正对春晖公园，湖光滟连。房间也挺宽敞的。早饭一般，品种不多，但是也能吃饱了。总体觉得不错，以后还会住。,"A hotel with high cost performance.I booked an ordinary standard house online, and when they gave me the room, they seemed to be a luxury monster.It is good, there is a balcony, which is facing Chunhui Park, and the lake is linked.The room is also very spacious.Breakfast is average, there are not many varieties, but they can be full.Overall feels good, I will live in the future."
0,在临安还是不错的一个酒店，干净。不足的是：1窗的隔音不好，很早就能听到外面的汽车声。2电视频道太少，临安已经是数字有线电视了但不知酒店为什么还没有。3没有免费的饮用水提供。4前台服务员不够专业、热情和礼貌。,"It's a good hotel in Lin'an, clean.The disadvantage is that the sound insulation of the 1 window is not good, and you can hear the sound of the car outside very early.2 TV channels are too few, Lin'an is already a digital cable TV, but I do n’t know why the hotel has not yet.3 No free drinking water provides.4 The front desk waiters are not professional, enthusiastic and polite."
1,"酒店和房间的基本设施都还行,就是服务还需跟上","The basic facilities in the hotel and room are okay, that is, the service needs to keep up"
1,"不错是个好酒店,比较方便,价格也合理,清洁卫生,早餐也还过得去,有水果送,哈哈,在网上订相对便宜几十元.这点至少在心理上可以接受.","Yes, it is a good hotel, which is more convenient, the price is reasonable, clean and hygienic, and the breakfast is still available. There are fruits, haha, setting a relatively cheap dozens of yuan on the Internet. This is at least psychologically acceptable."
1,除了前台服务态度一般，基本不会微笑，其他情况良好。房间干净，周围有苏果超市，交通也算可以。卫生间感觉太小了。,"Except for the front desk service attitude, it is basically not smiling, and other situations are good.The room is clean, and there are Su Guo supermarkets around, and transportation is okay.The bathroom feels too small."
1,我是1月6日入住华侨大厦的，来时在车上受了点风寒，入住登记时，不住的打喷嚏，总台服务员立刻关切的询问我是否感冒了？最让我感动的是，刚进房间，客房服务员竟然送来了一碗热腾腾的红糖姜水，这种人性化的服务真的让人感到温暖。不愧为泰安市唯一一家四星级酒店，从酒店到岱庙步行只有五分钟的距离，还有金钥匙服务中心赠送的市区图和泰山地图。酒店的服务，先于客人开口之前。酒店金钥匙为我们租车、订票，在回到家的第二天，我们还意外的收到了他们的问候的短信，到现在我们还是非常高兴选择了泰山华侨大厦。而且我们还约定，08年的春天带着朋友重游泰山。,"I stayed in the Overseas Chinese Building on January 6. I received a little wind in the car when I came. When I was registered, I couldn't help sneezing. The waiter of the main station immediately asked if I had a cold?What touched me the most was that as soon as I entered the room, the room waiter even sent a bowl of hot brown sugar ginger water. This humanized service was really warm.It is indeed the only four -star hotel in Tai'an City. It is only a five -minute distance from the hotel to the Temple of Dai Temple, as well as the urban map and Taishan map presented by the Golden Key Service Center.The hotel's service is before the guest speaks.The hotel's golden key rented a car and booked tickets for us. On the day when we got home, we also unexpectedly received a text message from their greetings. Until now we are still very happy to choose the Taishan Overseas Chinese Building.And we also agreed that in the spring of 2008, he brought friends to visit Taishan."
1,在新飞电器旁，周围环境幽静，宽带上网速度快,"Next to the new flying appliances, the surrounding environment is quiet, and the broadband Internet access speed is fast"
1,1、房间的风格很符合它的出身和环境，既时尚又有书卷味。很新很干净（包括是一般很容易显脏的地毯），没有潮湿或不通风的味道。我住的是提供电脑的商务房，很有在家SOHO的感觉，完全有别于其他大同小异的酒店。“配电脑”是个很好的卖点，建议把这点显示在价格表页面上，方便大家了解（我是看了其它网友的点评才知道有的）。2、无论是房间还是洗手间，所有的配置都很齐全。杂志、地图、浴袍，甚至沐浴花球，都一一准备了。服务态度和速度都不错。晚上有送来水果，不知道是入住送的，还是因为使用了房间送餐服务而由餐厅送的。3、28元的自助早餐一般般，如有别的选择，不建议在酒店吃。4、其实洗手间空间还挺大的，不知道为什么把淋浴的玻璃房弄得那么小。还有洗脸盘也是太小，而水龙头又太高，弯腰洗脸的时候会碰到头，水也会溅出盘外。5、不知道商务大床房每层有几间，我住的那间对着电梯。电梯到达时的提示声和人声有点吵。6、总体感觉不错，有机会还是会再住的。补充点评2008年3月1日：很多酒店房间都存在灯光不足的问题，但华师粤海不但灯光充足，而且分布恰到好处，无论你处于房间任何位置，要进行任何活动，你总可发现有合适的光源配合你的需求。总之它的室内设计，与其说是酒店，不如说是楼盘销售处的样板房――时尚、精致、令人愉悦。,"1. The style of the room is in line with its origin and environment.Very new and clean (including carpets that are generally prone to dirty), without the taste of humidity or ventilation.I live in a business house that provides a computer. It feels like SOHO at home, which is completely different from other hotels that are similar.""Matching a computer"" is a good selling point. It is recommended to display this on the price table, which is convenient for everyone to understand (I know that there are other netizens' reviews).2. Whether it is a room or a toilet, all the configuration is complete.Magazine, maps, bathrobes, and even bathing balls are prepared one by one.The service attitude and speed are good.At night, the fruit was sent. I do n’t know if it was delivered to it, or was sent by the restaurant because of the room delivery service of the room.3, 28 yuan buffet breakfast is generally. If there are other choices, it is not recommended to eat in a hotel.4. In fact, the space of the toilet is quite large. I don't know why the glass room of the shower is so small.There is also too small to wash the face, and the faucet is too high. When bending, the head will touch the head, and the water will splash out of the plate.5. I do n’t know how many large business beds are on each floor. The one I live in facing the elevator.The prompt sound and voice when the elevator arrived was a bit noisy.6. Overall feels good, and you still live again.Supplementary comment on March 1, 2008: Many hotel rooms have insufficient lighting problems, but Huashu Yuehai not only has sufficient lights, but also is just right. Whether you are in any place in the room, you can always find that there is a suitable one.The light source meets your needs.In short, its interior design, rather than a hotel, is a model house of real estate sales office -fashion, exquisite and pleasant."

1,第一次入住，说实在话就是图个方便就近，因为离我学校很近，而且听说还不错！但是入住以后才发现服务态度是不错，可是效率和处理问题的能力太差，入住那天天气那么冷，宾馆的空调不开，还是冷风，说是中央空调定在那个温度，强烈要求下答应给我调高两度，但是等了一个小时还是那样！第二天再次去电话，他们大堂经理说空调一直在维修！我不知道到底怎么了，但是认为这样肯定不是合理的！所以下次应该不会选择这样的饭店！失望！宾馆反馈2008年1月18日：首先感谢您入住本酒店，看了您点评后，经酒店调查，该天空调确在维修清理中，故十分抱歉影响了您休息，若您下次入住，本酒店可为您免费升级您所订房间，以做补偿，希望您下次能再次入住本酒店。,"The first time I stayed, to be honest, it was convenient, because it was close to our school, and I heard that it was not bad!However, after staying, I found that the service attitude is good, but the efficiency and the ability to deal with the problem are too poor.Two or twice, but it is still like that for an hour!Go to the phone again the next day, their lobby manager said that the air conditioner has been repairing!I don't know what's wrong, but I think this is definitely not reasonable!So next time you should not choose such a restaurant!disappointment!Hotel feedback on January 18, 2008: First of all, thank you for staying in this hotel.

0,入住各地的如家不少次，喜欢其简单实际，在没什么要求下，一般都是满意的。但是我国首都宣武门的这一家，其可恶处却给我留下很深的阴影：厕所马桶堵塞了，很自然就通知前台啦！等了两个多小时还没有人来修，很自然就打个电话催促一下啦！半个小时后一个所谓维修人员黑著脸来到，搞了一段时间弄不好，马上就说我乱拎东西到马桶内，我解释说我只是曾经把用过的厕纸拎进马桶，他马上用极不满的态度教训我，说用过的厕纸不可以拎进马桶，应该放进废纸箱内........！我也懒得跟这样的人理论，请他离开后，马上亲自走到前台找当值经理投诉，刚巧这个“师傅”也在前台，听到有人投诉他，立即走出来以极度仇视的眼光盯著我。当我公开询问在场各人有谁会把便后用过的厕纸放到厕所里的废纸箱时，竟然马上听到此人及另一个穿著保安制服的人大声说：我会！当值经理也忍不住笑起来。这时，我终于明白所谓的“如家”，就是“如住在别人的家”，亦即是寄人篱下，要入“家”随俗，一般正常的生活习惯在这里不适宜。但我的问题是：既然这所“如家”有如此奇异的规矩，为什么不把它列在住店的规则里呢？为什么在洗手间没有明确的告示呢？事后我庆幸在别人的“家”没有因为一点点自以为文明的习惯而被揍一顿呢！强烈邀请周星驰来这里住一次，担保不愁找不到无厘头的搞笑材料。,"There are many times in the home in various places, and they like their simple reality. They are generally satisfactory without any requirements.However, this family in Xuanwumen, the capital of our country, left me a deep shadow for me: the toilet toilet is blocked, and it is natural to notify the front desk!After waiting for more than two hours, no one came to repair it, so naturally, I would make a phone call to urge it!Half an hour later, a so -called maintenance staff came with a black face, and after a period of time, I couldn't get it well. I immediately said that I was in the toilet in the toilet.Immediately teach me with a very dissatisfied attitude, saying that the toilet paper I have used should not be put into the toilet, and I should put it in the waste carton ........!I was too lazy to theory with such a person. After he asked him to leave, he immediately went to the front desk to find the manager to complain. It happened that the ""master"" was also on the front desk. Hearing someone complained about him and immediately stared out with an extremely hatred vision.I.When I publicly asked everyone who would put the toilet paper used in the toilet in the toilet, everyone present immediately heard the person and another person in a security service uniform saying loudly: I will!The manager couldn't help laughing.At this time, I finally understood that the so -called ""home"" was ""living in someone else's home"", that is, under the fence, to enter the ""home"" to follow the custom. Generally, normal living habits are not suitable here.But my question is: Since this ""home"" has such a strange rule, why not list it in the rules of the store?Why is there no clear notice in the bathroom?Afterwards, I was glad that in the ""home"" of others, I did not have been beaten up because of a little habit of thinking of civilization!He strongly invited Zhou Xingchi to come here to live here, and he could not worry about finding nonsense funny materials."

0,酒店自诩准五星，入住后，让人大跌眼球。原本订的6日13至15日二晚住宿，由于飞机晚点，到达酒店已经是凌晨二时，没有门童，行李是自己提上台阶进大堂的。大堂的层面很低很压抑，装修陈旧而俗气，总台服务员自始至终没有微笑。问现在这个时候入住是否有优惠，她爱理不理以摇头代答。订的是毫华大床间，令人不可思议的是，这个所谓的豪华居然是这样的――电视机最多只有19寸，灯光昏暗，床硬硬的，没有供客人使用的纸袋，地毯很脏。特别是最多只有19寸的电视机，说准五星简直是一种欺诈了。于是决定天亮后就换到泰达美爵。退房时，居然又浪费了我近二十分钟。办完手续，也没有任何一个门童帮我推行李。看发票，盖的是部队招待所的章。原来这个所谓的准五星，居然是招待所！我百思不得其解，这种档次的酒店，怎么会得到一些客人这么高的评价。补充点评2008年6月25日：“1、您到店的时间已经超出您的预订时间，酒店仍然给您保留了房间，并且按照您预订的网络价格给予了优惠，而且免费为您升级到了豪华房间；2、您入住房间的电视机是21寸的液晶电视；3、客人需要购物袋可以向房务部或前台索取，我们会提供给客人......”――――一、我预订的是商务房，价格为558元，因为不喜欢商务房的装修风格，要求降格到豪华房。我这里保存着携程的订单，以及降格到豪华房后我支付的豪华房488元房价发票。我不知道贵酒店所称的“免费为您升级到了豪华房间”是什么意思。希望能看到解释。二、即便真如您所称，“电视机是21寸的液晶电视”，请告诉我，如此小屏的电视机，放在一家自称准五星标准的酒店的豪华房，是否合适？三、您提到“客人需要购物袋可以向房务部或前台索取”，这显然牵强了，若按照这种逻辑，是否可以延伸到客人需要卫浴用品可以向房务部或前台索取？若酒店真有“客人需要购物袋可以向房务部或前台索取”的惯例，那至少应该用文字的方式在床柜之类的地方明示吧？宾馆反馈2008年6月23日：尊敬的宾客：您好！非常感谢您把金海大酒店作为您大连之行的驿站，也非常感谢您对酒店提出的意见，对于您此行的不愉快我们深表歉意！在以后的工作中我们将加强酒店员工的培训，提高服务意识及服务质量！对于您以上提出的问题我们做略加解释，希望您能够理解！1、您到店的时间已经超出您的预订时间，酒店仍然给您保留了房间，并且按照您预订的网络价格给予了优惠，而且免费为您升级到了豪华房间；2、您入住房间的电视机是21寸的液晶电视；3、客人需要购物袋可以向房务部或前台索取，我们会提供给客人；4、酒店员工服务的不到位说明我们的管理还需要进一步加强。再一次感谢您所提出的意见，欢迎您能够再一次入住我们酒店！,"The hotel claims to be five -star, and after check -in, people are eye -catching.Originally, I was accommoded on the 6th to 15th on the 6th to the 15th. Due to the late plane, it was 2 am to reach the hotel. There was no door child. The luggage was put on the hall to enter the lobby.The lobby level is very low and depressed. The decoration is old and tacky. The waiters of the main station have no smile from beginning to end.Asked if there was a discount at this time at this time, she ignored the answer to shake her head.The big bed is ordered. What is incredible is that this so -called luxury is actually like this -the TV is only 19 inches, the lights are dim, the bed is hard, there is no paper bag for guests, the carpet is dirty, the carpet is dirty.EssenceIn particular, it is only a 19 -inch TV, saying that quasi -five -star is a kind of fraud.So he decided to change to Teda Meijue after dawn.When checking out, I wasted for nearly twenty minutes.After finishing the formalities, there is no door child to help me push my luggage.Looking at the invoice, it is stamped with the chapters of the troops.It turns out that this so -called quasi -five -star is actually a guest house!I can't understand how could this -grade hotels get such a high evaluation of some guests.Supplementary reviews June 25, 2008: ""1. The time you arrive in the store have exceeded your booking time, the hotel still retains the room for you, and gives a discount according to the network price you reservation, and the free upgrade will be upgraded to the luxury for youRoom; 2. The TV of your staying room is a 21 -inch LCD TV; 3. Guests need a shopping bag to ask for the Ministry of Housing or the front desk. We will provide it to the guests ... ""I booked a business house with a price of 558 yuan, because I do n’t like the decoration style of the business house, and requires downgrade to luxury houses.I save Ctrip's orders here, and I have paid 488 yuan of house prices in the luxury house that I paid after downgrading to the luxury room.I don't know what the ""free upgrade for you to a luxurious room for you"" what Gu Hotel is called.Hope to see the explanation.2. Even if you really call it, ""the TV is a 21 -inch LCD TV"", please tell me, such a small -screen TV, placed in a luxurious room of a hotel that claims to be a quasi -five -star standard, is it appropriate?Third, you mention that ""guests need shopping bags to ask for the Housing Department or the front desk"", which is obviously far -fetched. If this logic can extend to the guests, the guests need bathroom supplies to ask for the Ministry of Housing or the front desk?If the hotel really has the practice of ""guests need shopping bags to ask for the Housing Department or the front desk"", should at least use the text to be explicitly explicitly explicitly explicitly, right?Hotel feedback on June 23, 2008: Dear guest: Hello!Thank you very much for taking Jinhai Hotel as the station of your Dalian trip. Thank you very much for your opinions on the hotel. We apologize for your unhappiness of your trip!In future work, we will strengthen the training of hotel employees and improve service awareness and service quality!We explain the above questions above, I hope you can understand!1. The time you arrive at the store have exceeded your booking time. The hotel still retains the room for you, and gives discounts at the network price you booking, and it is free to upgrade you to a luxurious room for free; 2.It is a 21 -inch LCD TV; 3. Guests need shopping bags to ask for the Housing Department or the front desk, and we will provide guests; 4. Instead of hotel employee service, we will need to be further strengthened.Thank you again for your opinion, welcome to stay in our hotel again!"
1,我住的是4星的，不错！餐厅下班有点早，到9点就打烊！边上有个洗浴中心，不错！,"I live in 4 stars, good!The restaurant is a bit early, and it will be closed by 9 o'clock!There is a bathing center on the side, not bad!"
0,万杰国际不能刷卡是件令人最难以接受的事情，房间电视时长不能使用，网络还收费更让人难以接受。,"Wanjie International cannot swipe cards is the most unacceptable thing. The length of the room TV cannot be used, and the network charges are even more unacceptable."
1,慈溪酒店挺多的，国际相对其他酒店来说，交通比较方便。实在不认识路，问下路人估计应该都知道。作为一家四星的酒店，应该来说，该有的都有了，大堂挺气派的。一楼的房间跟其他的有点不同，可能价钱稍微便宜的缘故吧。总的来说，性价比还是比较高的。,"There are a lot of Cixi Hotel. Internationally, traffic is more convenient than other hotels.I really do n’t know the way, asking the subordinates I guess I should know.As a four -star hotel, there should be, there should be, there should be, and the lobby is quite elegant.The room on the first floor is a bit different from the other, and the price may be slightly cheap.Overall, cost -effective is relatively high."
1,酒店条件还是不错的，因为当天下午2点有考试，希望延到一点退房，怎么和前台商量都不行，于是就早晨退了房，这点比较遗憾。价格上：去了酒店才知道，我即便不找携程网，直接去前台，当天价格也是333，和携程是一摸一样的，所以携程的价格实在不能说有任何优惠。,"The hotel conditions are still good, because there are exams at 2 pm that day, and I hope to postpone a little check -up. How can I not work with the front descriptions, so I retired in the morning. This is a pity.In terms of price: I did n’t know when I went to the hotel. Even if I did n’t find Ctrip.com, I went directly to the front desk. The price was 333 that day, and it was the same as Ctrip. Therefore, Ctrip's price cannot be said to have any discounts."
1,"GOOD不错的酒店,还是好呀OK不错的","Good hotel, it's good, OK is good"
0,"挺悲哀的,住的是双标间国庆是230,在杭州住了个锦华之旅已经很挫了,这位仁兄有过之而无不及,依然的一阵阵怪味,纱窗坏的,空调乱叫,唯一的好处就是代售附近的景点(如:浙西大峡谷,天滩,大明山等)门票八五折,本身在携程订的是两晚,连忙把第二晚的给退了,听当天把我们带到天滩的司机介绍住在大峡谷镇的一个旅店.","It's very sad, the National Day of the Double Bidding is 230, and a journey to the Jinhua in Hangzhou has been frustrated.The only benefit of screaming is the 20 % off tickets of the nearby attractions (such as: Zhejiang Grand Canyon, Tian Beach, Daming Mountain, etc.).Listen to the driver who took us to Tiandan that day to introduce a hotel in Grand Canyon."
0,没住过这么差的酒店。首先不能刷卡。而且服务质量极差，我刚到时安排房间是未打扫的，再安排还是没打扫的，第三次才安排了干净的。我当时致电携程想换酒店，携程告诉我，我当时订酒店时承诺了未入住也付款（房间紧张），无奈，只能住了，我就不明白，那么多房间空着不打扫，紧张什么呀。办完手续，前台告诉我电梯是坏的，我提着三个大包爬上五楼，行李员，保安，服务员看见了根本就不管，估计心里还在笑呢。第二天早餐时发现包括本人才有三个人吃，而且餐台上的食物也就够十个人吃。就这个还以房间紧张为由，要求未入住也付款？酒店缺乏应有的诚实。后来携程客服的一个人以四倍的语速给我来个电话，估计以前是说绕口令的，说的东西其实几乎就没听清。主要意思是酒店的经理会亲自跟我因入住时的问题道歉的，但一直到我退房，也没人过问过。本人喷血不推荐前往该酒店。,"I haven't lived in such a bad hotel.Do not swipe the card first.And the quality of the service is very poor. I just arrived at the time of the room that was not cleaned, and then the arrangement was still not cleaned. The third time was scheduled to be clean.I called Ctrip to change the hotel at that time, and Ctrip told me that when I booked a hotel at the time, I promised that I had to pay without check -in (the room was tight). I was helpless, I could only live, I don’t understand, so many rooms do not clean up.ah.After finishing the formalities, the front desk told me that the elevator was bad. I climbed up to the fifth floor with three large bags. The luggage, security guard, the waiter didn't care at all, and it was estimated that he was still laughing.The next day, it was found that three people were eaten, and the food on the dining table was enough for ten people to eat.Regarding the tension of the room, it is required to pay without staying in?The hotel lacks its deserved honesty.Later, a person in Ctrip's customer service called me four times the speed of speaking. It is estimated that I used to say that the passwords were used to go.The main meaning is that the hotel manager will apologize to me because of the problem at the time of check -in, but until I check out, no one has asked.I don't recommend going to the hotel."
1,酒店的大堂真的很旧了，房间还可以，早餐的西餐厅比以前的就餐环境好了，以前乱哄哄的，（以前早餐是凭2张餐券，很多人估计叫外面的人来吃所以乱乱的），现在凭房卡就好多了。,"The lobby of the hotel is really old. The room is okay. The western restaurant in breakfast is better than the previous dining environment. In the past, it was chaotic.Relaxed), now it is much better with the house card."
1,客观地说，应该已经是石家庄最好的酒店了，各方面都还可以，房间稍微有点旧了，毛巾不是很白。不过下次还会选择,"Objectively speaking, it should be the best hotel in Shijiazhuang. It is okay in all aspects. The room is a bit old, and the towel is not very white.But I will choose next time"
1,很值得推荐的酒店，四星级，价格公道，童叟无欺，四星级的标准，三星级的价格，房间里铺了很不错的地毯，网络很通畅，不像某些酒店谎称“网络中毒”而不让上宽带，连好一点的借口都不会找！,"It is worth recommending hotels, four -star, fair price, no deception, four -star standard, three -star price, a very good carpet in the room, the network is smooth, unlike some hotels lied to say that""Network Poisoning"" does not allow broadband, and even better excuses will not find it!"
1,房间小，设施也不高档，服务可以，饮食不错,"The room is small, the facilities are not high -end, the service is available, and the diet is good"
1,"可能是建的时间比较早吧,感觉内部不是很突出了.","It may be early to build, and it feels that the interior is not very prominent."
0,"交通方便,门口有到黄河边去的34,9路公交车,到市中心的1路车。酒店房间设施陈旧，进门插钥匙牌取电后，竟然发现开水壶在空烧，后来知道水壶有故障，不会自动断电，向送早餐的服务员说了此事，未见反应。床头靠背软垫是破的。可能由于水质关系，洗脸盆，浴缸，马桶痕迹很多，显得很脏，地毯也不干净。早餐按客人要求的时间（7：00-9：00）送到房间，数量之多根本吃不完，质量就一般般了，好象就是火车站旁边市场摊子上卖的那些东西。房间押金是一天一天交的。要注意的是，结帐时服务员会问你要不要发票，要发票会自动在原来价格上加2元钱一天，事先并不加以任何说明。","The traffic is convenient. There is a bus 34,9 to the Yellow River at the door and 1 bus in the city center.The hotel room facilities were outdated. After entering the key to get the power to get the power, it was found that the opening kettle was burned. Later, I knew that the kettle was faulty, and it would not be automatically disconnected. I told the waiter who delivered breakfast and did not respond.The back of the bedside is broken.Perhaps due to the water quality, the washbasin, bathtub, and toilet marks have a lot of traces, which look dirty and the carpet is not clean.Breakfast is delivered to the room according to the time required by the guests (7: 00-9: 00).The deposit of the room is paid day by day.It should be noted that the waiter will ask if you want to invoiced during the checkout. The invoice will automatically add 2 yuan for one day at the original price, and there is no explanation in advance."
1,房间内设施有些旧，但洗浴设备还不错，洗澡水温度好，水量大。比较卫生。感觉比较适合工薪层家庭旅游时居住。,"The facilities in the room are a little old, but the bathing equipment is not bad. The temperature of the bath water is good and the water volume is large.More hygienic.It feels that it is more suitable for living in the working family."
1,"从乌鲁木齐火车站打的过去11块钱,在解放北路,离乌鲁木齐的二道桥市场也不远,可以去买干果,也可以去一些特色产品:陶瓷,地毯.但是路上得小心维族的檫皮鞋的小青年,被他们檫一次据说要200块钱,所以,那天我看见他们往我鞋子上油后,赶紧快跑,他们也追,我就拦了一辆的士.酒店的各项条件不错,我去的时候,是通过携程预订的,前台告诉我,你其实可以不用通过携程的,我们可以直接给你携程的价格房.所以,感觉携程在价格上没有任何优势.不过200块钱住四星级豪华标间,真的很值的.去机场打的要45块钱.","From the past 11 dollars from Urumqi Railway Station, in Jiefang North Road, it is not far from the Erdaoqiao market from Urumqi. You can buy dried fruit or some special products: ceramics, carpets.The young people of leather shoes were said to be 200 yuan by them once, so I saw them on my shoes that day, and hurried to run, they also chased, I stopped a taxi. The conditions of the hotel were good.When I went, I was booked through Ctrip. The front desk told me that you can not actually pass through Ctrip. We can directly give you the price room of Ctrip. So, I feel that Ctrip has no advantage in the price.The four -star luxury standard room is really worth it. It takes 45 yuan to go to the airport."
1,不错的酒店，性价比不错，房间很大，不过卫生间有点老化，总的来说还是不错的，下次还会入住,"Good hotels, the price is good, the room is very large, but the bathroom is a bit aging. In general, it is still good. I will stay in the next time"
0,房间很小，装修太差，电线全部裸露在外面，脏，不是一般的脏,"The room is very small, the decoration is too bad, all the wires are exposed outside, dirty, not ordinary dirty"
1,房间设施不错，建筑也有风格，就是大厅稍小。不过如果是想感受古城气氛，个人觉得，应住在四方街附近的小宾馆，像瑞和园就不错。,"The room facilities are good, and the building also has a style, that is, the hall is slightly smaller.However, if you want to feel the atmosphere of the ancient city, I personally feel that you should live in a small hotel near Sifang Street."
1,"豪华商务房,面积非常大,但颇有大而无当之感,酒店的地毯很脏,污渍随处可见,空气里面有挥之不去的酒气.建议携程考察一步之遥的华阳酒店,不少当地的朋友都推荐我们入住华阳.","Luxury business houses have a very large area, but they are quite large and unreasonable. The carpet of the hotel is dirty, stains can be seen everywhere, and there is lingering alcohol in the air. It is recommended to check the one -step Huayang Hotel.Friends recommend us to stay in Huayang."
1,酒店地理位置不错，出门走几步就是海滩。海景房之说过了，因为并不能一览无余，视觉障碍还是有的。酒店大堂空落落的，不甚符合五星级酒店形象。前台服务人员显然需要更多培训，态度和速度都成问题。电梯甚旧。房间的洁净度尚佳。卫生间的淋浴设备欠维护，地漏不够疏通。早餐品种选择看似很多，然而真正可选择的很少，廉价感十足。总之，与国际性同级酒店相比，程度差距明显，携程的价格对于这样的酒店而言贵了。,"The hotel has a good geographical location. A few steps out are beaches.The sea view room has been said, because there is no view of view, there are still visual obstacles.The hotel lobby is empty, not in line with the image of a five -star hotel.The front desk service staff obviously need more training, and the attitude and speed are problems.The elevator is very old.The cleanliness of the room is good.The bathroom shower equipment is not maintained, and the floor drain is not enough to clear.There are many choices for breakfast varieties, but there are very few choices, and they are full of cheapness.In short, compared with international hotels, the gap is obvious, and the price of Ctrip is expensive to such a hotel."
1,酒店位置不错，闹中取静。酒店服务员素质较高，能快速解决顾客的疑问和难题，主动热情，有耐心。房间有点小，而且布局不是非常合理，我住的是一个圆床的房间，房间是紫色调的，非常适合女士住，从书桌到洗手间需要绕床一周。但总体还是满意的，尤其是位置和服务。补充点评2008年5月21日：Sorry，请管理员帮忙把此评论转至南昌米兰假日酒店。,"The hotel location is good.Hotel waiters have high quality, can quickly solve customer questions and problems, take the initiative and enthusiasm, and have patience.The room is a bit small, and the layout is not very reasonable. I live in a round bed room. The room is purple. It is very suitable for ladies' lives. It takes a week from the desk to the bathroom.But it is generally satisfactory, especially location and service.Supplementary comment on May 21, 2008: Sorry, please help the administrator to transfer this comment to the Milan Holiday Hotel in Nanchang."
1,房间很好，环境也不错，只是个别房间太靠游乐场，早上想睡懒觉会被游乐场的机动游戏声吵醒。,"The room is very good, and the environment is good, but the individual room is too dependent on the playground. In the morning, if you want to sleep lazily, you will be awakened by the mobile game of the playground."
1,房间不错，也有升级，服务也不错如提供擦鞋服务等，在下雪天确实很有帮助。值得推荐入住。,"The room is good, there are also upgrades, and the service is also good, such as providing shoe polishing services, etc., it is indeed very helpful on snowy days.It is worth recommending check -in."
1,总体很好。第一次住公寓酒店，家的感觉很好，房间分里外间，特别宽畅。不是一般酒店的房间可以比的，床也是2张床都超大，就是有点硬。虽然开放式厨房我们也没怎么正式用，但还是方便。有张餐桌也很方便。顶层的餐厅也是丰简由人，油画廊的感觉，特特别。广东早茶也是很好吃方便。酒店周围环境也挺好，在林荫小路里，很安静，有点象国外的那么cottage的感觉。特别适合家庭情侣住。,"Overall.For the first time in the apartment hotel, the home felt very good.It is not comparable to the rooms of ordinary hotels. The beds are also large in two beds, which is a bit hard.Although we have not used open kitchens, it is still convenient.It is also convenient to have a dining table.The restaurant on the top floor is also the feeling of the people, the feeling of the oil gallery, special.Early tea in Guangdong is also delicious and convenient.The environment around the hotel is also very good. In the small tree -lined road, it is very quiet, a bit like a cottage as abroad.Especially suitable for family couples."
1,周末刚从杭州回来，感觉还是不错的。在携程上查看了好久最后还是决定选择杭州友好饭店，现在看来我的决定是正确的。我订的是行政正湖房，前台似乎只给了我间湖景1408房（因为房间和携程上看到的不一样）。不过我还是挺喜欢整个房间的布局，简洁明亮。特别是窗边的榻榻米，让我和LG可以一边喝茶一边欣赏西湖的景色。而且酒店想的很周到，床头柜上还有为女士准备的首饰盒（虽然我只戴了一副耳环）。20楼的旋转自助餐厅也不错，服务员都很亲切。唯一让我遗憾的就是房间里的热水壶很脏，瓶身里的加热棒上面星星点点布满了发白发绿的霉点。而且携程上说只要入住酒店就会有优惠，而我丝毫没有享受到任何优惠。总之，下次去还是会选择这家酒店的。宾馆反馈2008年8月6日：非常感谢您和您的家人能选择入住我们饭店，也非常感谢您中肯的点评。我们饭店的客房经过重新的设计和装修，同一房型的不同房间在装修风格上有一定的区别，下次入住的时候，您可以在预定时将您的个人喜好告知我们，我们会根据您的要求帮您安排合适的房间。对于您所提到的问题，我们表示抱歉，并已经责成相关部门改进。再次感谢您的点评，衷心期待您和您的家人再次光临。,"I just came back from Hangzhou on the weekend, and I felt good.I checked on Ctrip for a long time and finally decided to choose Hangzhou Friendship Hotel. Now it seems that my decision is correct.I ordered the administrative lake house. The front desk seemed to only give me the Lake Lake 1408 room (because the room and the Ctrip were different).But I still like the layout of the entire room, simple and bright.Especially the tatami by the window allows me and LG to enjoy the scenery of West Lake while drinking tea.And the hotel thinks very thoughtful, and there are jewelry boxes prepared for ladies on the bedside table (although I only wear a pair of earrings).The rotating buffet on the 20th floor is also good, and the waiters are very kind.The only thing that regrets is that the hot kettle in the room is dirty. The stars on the heating rod in the bottle are covered with white mold.And Ctrip said that as long as you stay in the hotel, there will be discounts, and I have not enjoyed any discounts at all.In short, I will choose this hotel next time.Hotel feedback on August 6, 2008: Thank you very much for you and your family to choose to stay in our hotel, and thank you very much for your comments.The rooms of our restaurant have been re -designed and renovated. Different rooms in the same room have a certain difference in decoration style. When you stay in the next time, you can tell us your personal preferences when you are scheduled.Help you arrange the right room.We are sorry for the problems you mentioned and have instructed relevant departments to improve.Thank you again for your comments, and I sincerely look forward to your visit and your family again."
1,开始住的六层的房子不是特别好，后来调到10层后房间不错。大小合适，虽然价格比较贵，但是4星级还是可以的。,"The six -story house that started living was not particularly good. Later, the room was good after being adjusted to 10th floor.The size is suitable, although the price is more expensive, but the 4 -star is still okay."
1,服务很热情，交通也很便利，下次如果去北京我还会选择这家酒店!,The service is very enthusiastic and the traffic is also very convenient. I will choose this hotel if I go to Beijing next time!
1,"设施比较陈旧了,但携程的房价确实比实际的门市价便宜了很多.离蓬莱风景区比较近.住的商务大床间,屋子很大,其他都很一般.","The facilities are relatively old, but Ctrip's house prices are indeed much cheaper than the actual store price. It is closer to the Penglai Scenic Area. In the large business bed where the business is, the room is very large, and others are very average."
1,交通方便，室内干净，基本生活电器都配备。出嫁那天需要红色床单，前晚给前台打了电话，他们回复说要去仓库找下，没想到第二天真给送来并布置好了，态度还不错！,"The transportation is convenient, the room is clean, and the basic living appliances are equipped.The red sheets needed to be on the day of marriage. They called the front desk the night before. They replied that they would go to the warehouse to find it. I did not expect that the next day they were sent and arranged. The attitude was not bad!"
0,我16日入住802房间，整个晚上均有隆隆噪音，即像电梯，又像楼上在作移动家具的体育锻炼。坐起来听又不明显，头一挨枕头又像枕在音响上，一夜没睡好，本来预定3天，第2天早上赶快逃跑。宾馆反馈2008年1月22日：非常感谢您给我们提出的宝贵意见。由于酒店当晚紧急工程抢修给您造成不便请谅解。房间如有任何问题，请致电酒店前台，酒店前台将竭诚为客人服务；欢迎您再次入住中南海滨大酒店并提出宝贵意见。,"I stayed in Room 802 on the 16th. There were noise all night, that is, like an elevator, and like a physical exercise for mobile furniture upstairs.Sitting up and listening is not obvious. The head bearing the pillow is like a pillow on the sound. I didn't sleep well overnight. I was scheduled for 3 days. On the morning of the second day, I ran away.Hotel feedback on January 22, 2008: Thank you very much for your valuable opinions.Please understand if the hotel's emergency project that night has caused inconvenience.If you have any problems in the room, please call the hotel's front desk, and the hotel's front desk will serve the guests wholeheartedly; welcome to stay in the Zhongnan Sea Hotel and put forward valuable opinions."
1,"新会不错的酒店了,环境优雅,没有什么娱乐设施,最适宜休息","The hotel is good, the environment is elegant, there are no entertainment facilities, the most suitable rest"
1,酒店有点旧，房间比较小，但酒店的位子不错，就在海边，可以直接去游泳。8楼的海景打开窗户就是海。如果想住在热闹的地带，这里不是一个很好的选择，不过威海城市真的比较小，打车还是相当便宜的。晚上酒店门口出租车比较少。,"The hotel is a bit old and the room is relatively small, but the hotel's seat is good. Just by the sea, you can go swimming directly.The sea view on the 8th floor is the sea.If you want to live in a lively area, this is not a good choice, but Weihai City is really small, and taxi is still cheap.There are fewer taxis at the entrance of the hotel at night."
1,这家酒店是我帮巴西客人订的，据客人说还不错，而且到机场也很方便。,"This hotel was ordered by my Brazilian guest. According to the guests, it was not bad, and it was very convenient to arrive at the airport."
1,酒店地理位置还不错，离外滩、步行街都满近的。我住的是单间，不靠马路，以为会比较安静，哪知窗子外面是酒店内部的一个铁制楼梯，夜晚常有人走过，咣当直响，还有边走边唱歌的，受不了。除了前台小姐面无表情，其它都还行。,"The hotel's geographical location is not bad, and it is close to the Bund and the pedestrian street.I live in a single room. I do n’t rely on the road. I thought it would be quiet. There was an iron staircase inside the hotel outside the window. People often walked through at night, and they sang while walking.Except for the expression of the front desk lady, everything else is okay."
1,位置好，价格合适，环境不错，房间也比较干净，在石家庄这样的地方已经很不错了，下次有机会还定这个酒店。,"The location is good, the price is suitable, the environment is good, and the room is relatively clean. It is already very good in the place such as Shijiazhuang. I have the opportunity to set this hotel next time."
0,晚上到的酒店，大堂灯都关了，来客人还舍不得开，打手电开的房，绝了！前脚刚进房间后脚按摩电话就打进来，牛叉！社会主义好啊！,"The hotel at night was turned off, and the guests were reluctant to open.Just enter the room and get in just after entering the room, the cow fork!Socialism is good!"
0,设施陈旧，饭店各区域之间的交通混乱，早餐品种少、品质差，优胜之处是周边的交通方便。,"Old facilities, the traffic between the restaurants of the hotel is chaotic, the breakfast varieties are small, the quality is poor, and the victory is convenient for surrounding traffic."
1,每次住的感觉都不错，就是这次被蚊子打扰了，建议加强房间灭蚊,"I feel good every time I live, that is, this time I was disturbed by mosquitoes. It is recommended to strengthen the mosquito extinguishing in the room."
1,这次的价格比以前贵一点，但是还是客户来住的首选。环境非常好的，服务也好。出了门口的服务生呆呆的，其他都赞。客人还是比较满意~~,"The price this time is a bit more expensive than before, but it is the first choice for customers to live.The environment is very good and the service is good.The waiter at the door was dumb, and everyone else praised.Guests are still satisfied ~~"
1,"一家可以的酒店,服务不错,地理位置优越,性价比高。总之，138元包早餐,市话，长途免费打还是很划算的,值得一住。","A good hotel, good service, excellent geographical location, and high cost performance.In short, 138 yuan for breakfast, market dialect, long -distance free play is still very cost -effective, it is worth living."
1,"住了美居.环境很好.服务很好,下次去一定还住~~~唯一不足的就是洗浴的时候水温不是很稳定.",Living in Meiju. The environment is very good. The service is very good. The only disadvantage must be in the next time. The only disadvantage is that the water temperature is not very stable when bathing.
1,环境非常的好，绿化面积非常的大，服务也挺周到的，可能是新推出的经济型房间的原因，房价非常的小，但是性格比还是挺不错的。,"The environment is very good, the area of greening is very large, and the service is very thoughtful. It may be the reason for the newly launched economic room. The house price is very small, but the personality ratio is still very good."
1,我是1月10号到的牡丹江，当晚在金鼎前台问价，门市价360元，携程310元，含早，17楼的高级标间。金鼎确实不错，门童、前台，餐厅、客房的服务都亲切周到，不愧是牡佳地区最好的4星级酒店。离火车站很近，但不吵，走5、6分钟路就到，出门右转到主要的商业街也就10分钟不到，方便的很。房间宽敞，自助早餐品种和质量也都行。要说有什么欠缺的地方，就是卫生间顶部的墙面有点霉斑和水迹，离4星装潢标准差些。下次有机会还会住她家，性价比高。,"I arrived at Mudanjiang on January 10th. On the night, I asked the price at the front desk of Jinding. The store price was 360 yuan, and Ctrip was 310 yuan, including early, on the 17th floor.Jin Ding is really good. The service of the door children, the front desk, the dining room and the guest rooms are all kind and thoughtful. It is indeed the best 4 -star hotel in the Mujia area.It is very close to the train station, but it is not noisy. After 5 or 6 minutes, you will arrive in less than 10 minutes when you go out to the main commercial street, which is very convenient.The room is spacious, and the buffet breakfast varieties and quality are also okay.To say that there is any lack, the walls on the top of the bathroom are a bit moldy and waters, and the standard difference between the 4 -star decoration is more different.Next time I have a chance to live in her house, and the price is high."
1,真是一间不错的酒店，但我们入住时只提供一份早餐，要求增加一份，居然要收68元，没价值。,"It is really a good hotel, but we only provide one breakfast when we stay in, asking for adding one, it actually collects 68 yuan, which is worthless."
0,网上评价不错，但是实际情况并不尽如人意，与2-3星的水平差不多~~总的来说，性价比不高！,"The online evaluation is good, but the actual situation is not satisfactory, similar to the level of 2-3 stars ~~ In general, the price is not high!"
0,"酒店比较旧，设施也比较老，客房服务人员态度比较冷漠，而不讲普通话，让我们外地人觉得有点麻烦。客房里不能烧开水,需要打电话叫服务员送开水过来。","The hotel is relatively old and the facilities are older. The attitude of the guest room service staff is relatively indifferent, without speaking Mandarin, which makes us feel a little troublesome.The room cannot be boiled in the room, and you need to call the waiter to send the water."
0,2007年12月底住的。地方在小路上，司机不一定找得到。屋里霉味极重，房间脏，没热水。第二天他们告诉我，那间房是从业主那里刚收回来的，没准备好，不应该租给我的。怎么不早说啊。（哦，这里客房、业主、写字全混在一起。一楼你要问事不小心问了物业而不是酒店前台，他们还给你脸色看呢，晕！）我要退房，有位姓李的女经理死活拉着我接着住，赔不是，给我免费升级。你现在态度好，但是你们总体还是很差啊。楼顶的餐厅早饭绝对差，晚饭不知道，地方看起来就很怪，没有人气。总之，千万别住在这里，如果无改善的话！,"Live at the end of December 2007.On the road, the driver may not find it.The mold in the house is extremely heavy, the room is dirty, and there is no hot water.The next day they told me that the room was just recovered from the owner. It was not ready and should not be rented to me.Why don't you say it early.(Oh, the guest rooms, owners, and writing are all mixed together. On the first floor, you have to ask about the property instead of the hotel's front desk. They also show you your face, dizzy!) I want to check outThe female manager took me to live and live, and the compensation was not to upgrade me for free.You have a good attitude now, but you are still very bad.The restaurant on the top of the building is absolutely bad. I do n’t know for dinner. The place looks strange and has no popularity.In short, don't live here, if no improvement!"
0,这家酒店太烂了。特别是服务差的很，简直让人火大。我通过携程预定了早餐，结果被告知从七点钟才开始，那我说我退掉吧，结果告诉我携程订了就不能退。早晨在房间打电话告诉前台查房，结果我到前台后，前台还没打，等到再次说退房时，才磨磨蹭蹭的打电话，结果等了几分钟还是没人查。等签单时才发现自己名字的两个字竟然被搞反了，真搞不懂，我实在是不敢恭维，而且莫名其妙的在我的名字后面竟然出现了另一个人名。建议各位不要入住。至所以给服务打两分，是因为其餐厅给我送了碗姜汤，比较感动，要不然服务肯定的一分。,"This hotel is too bad.Especially the poor service is very popular.I booked breakfast through Ctrip, and I was told that I started from seven o'clock. Then I said that I would retreat, and I told me that Ctrip could not book it.In the morning, I called in the room to tell the front desk to check the house. As a result, after I arrived at the front desk, I hadn't called the front desk. When I said the check -in, I called the phone. As a result, I still waited for a few minutes.When I signed the order, I found that the word of my name was reversed. I really didn't understand. I really didn't dare to compliment, and somehow appeared another person behind my name.It is recommended not to stay in.So I gave the service two points because my restaurant gave me a bowl of ginger soup, which was more moved, otherwise the service was certain."
1,1、内装修还不错，看起来很有特色。2、卫生也还可以，只是房间小了点。3、最重要的是各个房间不隔音，隔壁咳嗽都能听见，太可怕了。,"1. The interior decoration is not bad, and it looks very distinctive.2. Health is also okay, but the room is a bit smaller.3. The most important thing is that each room does not sound insulation, and the cough next door can be heard. It is terrible."
1,1。环境不错，不远就是三峡广场，无聊可以去看看美女2。早餐，赞！3。结帐速度较慢总的来说，还是不错的,"1.The environment is good, not far away is the Three Gorges Plaza. Boring can go to see Beauty 2.Breakfast, praise!3.In terms of slow check -out speed, it is still good"
0,"前台服务态度十分恶劣,总体印象很不好.影响到出行心情.","The front desk service attitude is very bad, and the overall impression is very bad. It affects the mood of travel."
1,"设施太旧了,服务也不行,打电话要个插座都推来推去,给四星太勉强了.","The facilities are too old, and the service is not good. The call for a call is pushed around, and the four stars are barely."
1,酒店地理位置很好，就在王府井，交通方便。但由于历史旧了点，所以有点旧。看个人需要了。,"The hotel has a good geographical location, just in Wangfujing, which is convenient for transportation.But because the history is a bit old, it is a bit old.See personal needs."
1,我们定的是豪华大床房，房间很漂亮也很干净，就是卫生间一洗澡就水漫金山。第一天去在修管道没热水，空调还米力气。不过第二天都好了，算偶倒霉。不过这个酒店离西湖不远，周围超级热闹，服饰街就在附近。,"We have a large luxury bed room. The rooms are very beautiful and clean, that is, the bathroom is watery and Jinshan as soon as we take a bath.On the first day, there was no hot water in repairing the pipeline, and the air conditioner was still capable.But the next day was fine, the puppet was unlucky.However, this hotel is not far from the West Lake, and the surrounding is super lively. The clothing street is nearby."
1,"服度很好.不管是前是後勤人,均很情,以待人;事效率高.包括登入住,,客房服等;工作尚有不足.如容易被忽的床管老化等,建酒店方面可以定期修,等到客反,就稍被了.祝程旅行及庭酒店越越好!","The degree of service is very good. Whether it is a logistical person, it is very affectionate to treat others; the efficiency is high. It includes staying in, room uniforms, etc.; there are still insufficient work.It can be repaired regularly, and when the guest is anti -anti, you will be a little bit."
1,第二次入住了，感觉还好，只是酒店不提供浴袍很不方便。宾馆反馈2008年5月30日：感谢您再次入住华君酒店，酒店为豪华套房配备了浴袍、电脑并赠送水果，希望您下次能选择豪华房型；或者酒店可视房间情况为您进行升级服务。再次感谢您对华君酒店的厚爱。,"The second time I stayed, it felt okay, but it was inconvenient to not provide bathrobes in the hotel.Hotel feedback on May 30, 2008: Thank you for staying at Huajun Hotel again. The hotel is equipped with bathrobes, computers and gifts for luxury suite. I hope you can choose luxury room types next time.Serve.Thank you again for your love for Huajun Hotel."
1,比较新的四星酒店，各方面都还不错，应该算是很标准的4星服务，值得推荐宾馆反馈2008年7月31日：感谢您对酒店的认可，期待您的再次光临！,"The new four -star hotel is not bad in all aspects. It should be considered a very standard 4 -star service. It is worth recommending hotels to feedback July 31, 2008: Thank you for your recognition of the hotel and look forward to your visit again!"
1,沈阳喜来登，不错的酒店：1）位于市中心，青年大街上，对面是西武，旁边是万豪。万豪虽然外观漂亮，但走进去没有喜来登气派。喜来登的大堂非常漂亮，还有好多名店，Canali，EA，Montblanc都有。2）房间不大，但可以看青年大街街景。浴具不新，但浴缸超大。很赞。3）服务不错，但不知是不是因为沈阳冬天太冷，门口服务生不帮忙开车门。4）游泳池超赞！健身房设备齐全，完全符合喜来登国际标准。以后去沈阳，还住喜来登。,"Shenyang Xilain, a good hotel: 1) Located in the city center, on the youth street, Western, Wanhao next to it.Although Marriott's appearance is beautiful, she did not go in without the Sheraton Qi.Sheraton's lobby is very beautiful, and there are many stores, Canali, EA, Montblanc.2) The room is not large, but you can see the street view of Youth Street.The bath is not new, but the bathtub is very large.great.3) The service is good, but I do n’t know if it is because Shenyang winter is too cold. The waiter at the door does not help drive the door.4) The swimming pool is great!The gym has complete equipment and fully meets the international standards of Xilain.In the future, I went to Shenyang and lived in Sheraton."
1,"酒店房间太小了性价比不是很好,不过越靠北越是这样,没有办法啊,还是南方的酒店性价比好!","The hotel room is too small and the price / performance ratio is not very good, but the more you are in the north are the same. There is no way. It is still good cost -effective in the southern hotel!"
1,"在杭州,新侨是地理位置相当优越的酒店。酒店位于杭州最繁华的解放路，离西湖步行只要5分钟，马路对面就是当地有名的解放路百货商店，还有解百超市，购物非常方便。离百年老店奎元馆、知味馆都很近。大堂宽敞，房间安静，隔音不错，被子柔软，蛮舒服的。宾馆反馈2008年7月17日：尊敬的宾客，非常感谢您对我们饭店的肯定，能够得到您的赞许是对我们工作最大的鼓励。我们将立足自身优势，不断加强员工培训，以优质的服务期待您的再次光临！","In Hangzhou, Xinqiao is a very geographical hotel.The hotel is located in the most prosperous liberation road in Hangzhou.

You can get your praise the biggest encouragement for our work.We will be based on our own advantages, continue to strengthen employee training, and look forward to your visit again with high -quality services!"
1,酒店的地理位置确实不错，离南京东路和福州路都很近都只走几分钟路了，特别是上海书城就在不到一百米远，旁边还有浦发银行和民生银行，酒店服务不错，以后可能还会住了。就希望早餐好点！,"The geographical location of the hotel is really good, and it is only a few minutes away from Nanjing East Road and Fuzhou Road, especially the Shanghai Book City is less than 100 meters away. There are also SPDB and Minsheng Bank. The hotel service is good., I may live in the future.I hope that breakfast is better!"
0,服务：服务差，我在预定中已经说明到店时间，我按时到达却没有房间，等了将近3个小时方能入住；且第一次分配的房间已有客人入住，我先后到前台3、4次才入住。房间：房间小而且没有窗户，房间在地下室，痛风很差，房间内放置一张1.5米宽的双人床后，几乎没有行动的空间，电视吊挂在天花板上，而且非常小……在房间内根本无法获得良好的休息。周边：周围的餐厅、超市等设施不全，或向北3站地到北辰购物中心或向南到三环后向东、向西大约1至2站地的距离后才有餐饮集中的地方。近距离内也没有像样的超市。,"Service: The service is poor. I have stated in the store time in the reservation. I arrived on time but I had no rooms. I waited for nearly 3 hours to stay in; and the room I assigned for the first time had already been in the front desk. I went to the front desk. 3.4 times to stay in.Room: The room is small and there are no windows. The room is in the basement. The gout is very poor. After placing a 1.5 -meter -wide double bed in the room, there is almost no action space.It is impossible to get a good rest at all.Surrounding: Insufficient facilities such as restaurants, supermarkets, etc., or north three stations to Beichen Shopping Center or south to the third ring, east, and west of about 1 to 2 stations will be concentrated in the concentration of catering.There is no decent supermarket within a close range."
1,环境很不错，当然价格贵了点，除此之外，服务态度非常好，我都很满意。,"The environment is very good, of course, the price is a bit expensive. In addition, the service attitude is very good, and I am very satisfied."
1,酒店位置非常好，装修就是旧了点，服务还可以，比较热情、周到，有机会我还会住在那里。,The hotel location is very good. The decoration is older. The service is okay. It is more enthusiastic and thoughtful. I still live there.
1,黄金周前的房价还行的，作为一个县城的酒店，硬件设施应该算是相当不错了。由于同学的老人管帐，看了房间后与同学耳语太贵，当得知交的钱是押金后，立马对房间设施赞不绝口！呵呵！停车场车位充足，一楼中餐厅价格很便宜，味道尚可，就是量少点儿。在安吉这种地方，这样的标准相当不错了，就是价格还应该再降15％左右就更具性价比了！,"The house prices before the Golden Week are okay. As a hotel in a county, hardware facilities should be considered quite good.Because the old man's old man took the account, he whispered with the classmates after reading the room. When he learned that the money he paid was the deposit, he immediately praised the room facilities!hehe!The parking lot parking space is sufficient. The price of the restaurant on the first floor is very cheap, and the taste is acceptable.In Anji, such a standard is quite good, that is, the price should be reduced by about 15 %, which is more cost -effective!"
1,我和朋友来厦门游玩，听说这家酒店在市政府中心，交通很便利，于是我们选择入住这家酒店。从机场坐的士直达店门口，只需要20分钟左右，刚下车，值班经理见我们带了行李，马上上前来帮忙并贴心慰问，后来得知我们的来意，交代了前台的接待员把我们安排在同一楼层住，我们都感觉很满意。整体来说，酒店的服务很热情，房间干净、整齐，入住时还赠送了欢迎果篮，房间内还有免费宽带上网，游泳池和康乐设施也不错。这里的自助早餐也很丰富，总而言知，物有所值。一出门口，就是车站，周围有厦门各种出名的小吃店，西餐厅也不少，还有比较有特色的商业街，连银行中心也在附近不远处，购物非常方便。来厦门游玩，这家酒店是不错的选择！,"My friends and I came to Xiamen to play. I heard that this hotel is in the center of the city government. The traffic is very convenient, so we choose to stay in this hotel.It only took about 20 minutes to take the taxi from the airport. As soon as I got off the bus, the manager on duty saw us with luggage, and immediately came to help and intimate condolences. LaterWe arrange to live on the same floor, and we all feel very satisfied.On the whole, the hotel's service is very enthusiastic. The room is clean and neat. Welcome fruit baskets are given away during the stay. There are free broadband access to the room in the room. The swimming pool and recreational facilities are also good.The buffet breakfast here is also very rich.At the door, there is a station, there are all kinds of famous snack bars in Xiamen, there are many western restaurants, and there are more distinctive commercial streets. Even the bank center is not far away nearby. Shopping is very convenient.Come to Xiamen to play, this hotel is a good choice!"
1,很好的饭店啊，临近火车东站，走过去50米，去香港太方便了，饭店本身不错，日本料理做的味道很好，但不便宜哦。,"Very good restaurant, near the east station of the train, 50 meters in the past, it is too convenient to go to Hong Kong. The hotel itself is good. Japanese cuisine tastes good, but it is not cheap."
1,帮朋友定的反应还不错下次去应该还会定那里吧：）,"The response to help friends is not bad. Next time, I should decide there :)"
0,感觉很一般，根本就没有其他人评价上说的好。前台服务一般，没有很热情的感觉，但是也没有不好的态度。房间比较小，我订的是大床房，216元。从入住的第一天开始（我住了三天），枕头套似乎就没换过，因为上面有个脏脏的旧印子很容易辨认。设施也很简单，最不方便的是热水，洗澡时间不能长，否则就要等20分钟后再洗。另外，地板非常的滑，第一天洗澡出来，就摔了一跤，幸好没什么大碍。下次去北京，肯定不会再住了，还是要选择专业一点的酒店比较好。,"It feels very average, and no one else is good at evaluating.The front desk service is average, there is no very enthusiastic feeling, but there is no bad attitude.The room is relatively small. I booked a large bed, 216 yuan.From the first day of staying (I lived for three days), the pillow cover didn't seem to have changed it, because there was a dirty old seal on it that it was easy to identify.The facilities are also very simple. The most inconvenient is hot water. The bathing time should not be long, otherwise it will have to wait 20 minutes before washing.In addition, the floor was very slippery. When I took a bath on the first day, I fell down. Fortunately, there was no big deal.Next time I go to Beijing, I will definitely not stay anymore, it is better to choose a professional hotel."
1,酒店环境还不错，只是床真的是太软了，不习惯。早餐过于简单，且每天早上都一样。宾馆反馈2008年6月13日：首先感谢您入住我们酒店，客栈的床是惰性海绵，有舒缓解压，特别是对脊椎有良好的治疗作用。如果感觉太软，有硬席可加，这样就跟普通的床一样了。早餐我们是分A套和B套任选一种的方式，对续住的客人而言，可以两种都品尝。如果有机会，真诚的希望您能再次光临我们酒店！,"The hotel environment is not bad, but the bed is really too soft and not used to it.Breakfast is too simple, and every morning is the same.Hotel feedback on June 13, 2008: First of all, thank you for staying in our hotel. The bed in the inn is an inert sponge, which has a soothing and compression, especially for the spine.If it feels too soft, there is a hard seat to add, so it is the same as the ordinary bed.Breakfast we are divided into one of the A set and B set. For those who live, they can taste both of them.If you have a chance, I sincerely hope that you can visit our hotel again!"
0,应该不是我第一次评价这个酒店了，没办法再次补充如下：1、早餐真是超级垃圾，做得真的感觉和猪食差不多，不知道请的什么厨师？2、仍然是早餐的问题，在大堂旁的一个好象是叫‘玛格丽特的’西餐厅；1>光线特别不好，谁都希望早上起来有个明亮的环境用餐，但这里肯定不是；2>给食品加温的不是电热式，采用的是燃烧腊来加热/保温，弄得餐厅里面很浓的一股腊燃烧后的气味，让人感觉非常不好；3、真不知道这样的酒店怎么样就能够评上4星？哎。。。,"It should not be the first time I evaluated this hotel. I ca n’t add it as follows: 1. Breakfast is really super garbage. It really feels similar to pig food. I do n’t know what chef I ask?2. It is still a problem of breakfast. One of the signs called 'Margaret's ""Western Restaurant; 1> The light is particularly not good.; 2> It is not an electrical heating that is warm to the food. The combustion is used to heat/thermal insulation, so that the smell after burning in the restaurant makes people feel very bad; 3. I really don’t know that this is like thisHow can a hotel be commented on 4 stars?Why.EssenceEssence"
1,总体很满意，但有一点需改进，我在9楼入住，走时到1楼前台结帐时由9楼层服务员检查房间，发现我有零星物品遗失在房间，我当时请他们送下来，结果答复是到4楼客房服务部去取，我到了4楼，又说服员员没时间，又要到9楼去取。当然这没什么，但是如果他们给东西送下来，哪怕是到4楼就取到了东西，我会对酒店有更好的印象。,"Overall is very satisfied, but one thing needs to be improved. I stayed on the 9th floor. When I went to the front desk on the first floor, I checked the room on the 9th floor. I found that I had sporadic items lost in the room. I asked them to send it off at the time.Go to the room service department on the 4th floor. I went to the 4th floor and persuaded the members to have no time to get it on the 9th floor.Of course, this is nothing, but if they give things down, even if they get things on the 4th floor, I will have a better impression on the hotel."
1,这家酒店虽然设施比较老，价格比较贵（很小的经济标准间还330），但是早餐很不错，服务更是不错…………服务生很有眼力见，主动过来帮忙拿东西，临走我想把车里的垃圾找垃圾箱扔了，正找呢，服务生又主动过来问情况，然后帮我把垃圾拿走扔掉了…………过了一个小时，酒店打来电话问是不是衣服落他们那儿了，可是我们上了高速回不去了，于是留了地址请他们寄回来，结果第二天一早衣服就到了，所以感觉服务很好，还特意打电话回去感谢他们…………这服务啊，跟那个啥交通大厦对比一下啊，那个天上地下啊（停车没人管，然后前台非说没收到携程的订单还不跟携程联系非让我自己联系，手机给她后她倒聊上了，于是我生气出门走人，结果就十分钟的停车保安竟然敢管我收5块的停车费！）这个价格高一点房间小一点我也认了…………强烈建议携程把交通大厦从合作对象中剔除，实在有损携程形象……我想点评交通大厦来着，因为很气愤就没有住，所以不让我点评，不过我给携程写了意见了……也建议大家不要订交通大厦，即使携程推荐…………,"Although this hotel is older and the price is more expensive (the small economic standard room is 330), but the breakfast is very good, the service is even more good ...I want to throw away the garbage tank in the car in the car. I was looking for it. The waiter took the initiative to ask the situation again, and then helped me throw away the garbage ... After an hour, the hotel called and asked if it wasIt wasn't that the clothes fell to them, but we couldn't go back at a high speed, so we left the address and asked them to send it back. As a result, the clothes arrived early the next morning, so I felt that the service was good, and I also called back to thank them ...… This service, compare with that traffic building, that heaven and ground (no one in the parking, and then the front desk has not received the order of Ctrip’s order and does not contact me.I was chatting, so I went out to go out of the house. As a result, the parking security of ten minutes dared to control me to charge me 5 yuan!) This price is higher.The traffic building is eliminated from the object of cooperation, and it really damages the image of Ctrip ... I want to comment on the traffic building, because I do n’t live because I am very angry, so I do n’t let me comment, but I wrote an opinion for Ctrip ... I also suggest that you do n’t want to do n’t want to do it.Book the traffic building, even if Ctrip recommends .............."
0,在前台不能刷卡预授权，有点不方便。搞不懂，为什么可以刷卡消费，却不能刷预授权？,"It is a bit inconvenient to swipe cards at the front desk.I do n’t understand why you can swipe your card consumption, but you ca n’t swipe to authorize?"
0,"郁闷!!!气愤!!不明白光纤竟然比上海锦江之星的网速还慢,想要晚上网速快千万别去这家!!!因网上介绍的是光纤网络,所以才去它家.结果登个QQ也要好久,网速跟爬似的.和国外朋友约好上网,结果卡的不行,连上海的朋友也说听我说话有一句没一句的.我在大连和人合租滴房,因怕晚上和国外朋友聊天影响同租人休息,才去了酒店,结果出了钱还没聊成.打电话去前台,说是电脑部下班了,让电工来看下,后来让我去隔壁房间试下,结果一样慢.酒店不是应该24小时服务的吗?","Depressed !!!

1,入住此酒店：软件及硬件比较好，价格合理。但停车的车库不能直接进入酒店，要出车库从正门进入，不是很方便。不过下次来太原，她是首选。,"Check in this hotel: software and hardware are better and reasonable.However, the parking garage cannot enter the hotel directly. It is not very convenient to go out of the garage from the main entrance.But next time she came to Taiyuan, she was the first choice."
1,这家酒店离阳朔有15分钟的车程，是一家民居（民居在阳朔很普遍）。整撞建筑的风格很特别，古色古香。不出家门就能看到阳朔的山山水水。只要打电话给李阿姨，他回安排车到阳朔来接。李阿姨很热情，给人一种很真诚的感觉，很健谈，把我们当成一家人，民居提供的饭菜也很好吃。只是要是在她那里租自行车或导游的话，会比外面贵一点。补充点评2008年7月4日：房间设施一般，建议大家自己带洗漱用品和毛巾。毕竟是农家，不比大酒店。,"This hotel has a 15 -minute drive from Yangshuo and is a house (common in houses in Yangshuo).The style of hitting the building is very special, antique.You can see the mountains and rivers of Yangshuo without going out.As long as he called Aunt Li, he arranged for the car to pick up the car.Auntie Li is very enthusiastic and gives people a very sincere feeling. It is very talkative. He treats us as a family. The food provided by the house is also delicious.Just rent a bicycle or tour guide with her, it will be a little more expensive than the outside.Supplementary comment July 4, 2008: The room facilities are average. It is recommended that you bring it to washed products and towels.After all, it is a farmhouse, no better than a big hotel."
1,没什么说的了，第二次入住，很满意。房间整洁大气，服务规范热情，交通也很方便――离火车站和汽车站都是起步价多一点点。价格也便宜，咖啡吧可以提供商务套餐（虽然品种不怎么丰富，但是一个人吃也不讲究）。,"Nothing to say, staying in the second time, very satisfied.The room is neat and atmospheric, the service standards are enthusiastic, and the transportation is also very convenient.The price is also cheap, coffee bar can provide business packages (although the variety is not very rich, but one person is not particular about eating)."
1,酒店新装修，房间硬件设施还是不错的。但是，餐厅实在太差，上菜非常慢，价格奇贵，且质量差。86元2小片的香煎银鳕鱼居然是臭的，叫来餐厅经理，品尝了半天不吭声，最后竟然然颠倒黑白地说不臭，实在不能容忍。,"The hotel's new decoration, the hardware facilities of the room are still good.However, the restaurant is too bad, the food is very slow, the price is expensive, and the quality is poor.86 yuan 2 small pieces of pan -fried cod is actually smelly. He called the restaurant manager and tasted for a long time without saying a few days. In the end, it turned out to be black and white."
1,住了一个晚上的大床房，总体感觉不好不坏。房间是超级大，还有吧台，不过对我来说没什么用处，装修感觉不够轻松。刚进房间放下包就有小姐打电话来问需不需要按摩服务，让人怀疑是不是酒店有什么猫腻。卫生间洗澡水超大，但是洗浴用品比较少，不过有一大堆乱七八糟的东西像什么安全套，一次性内裤，子等等要收费。地理位置倒还不错，交通还算方面。还有一点，早餐比较一般，而且位置太少了，等个位置吃早饭等了好久。补充点评2008年7月13日：忘记说了，房间内打长途竟然还要钱，而且宽带上网巨慢。,"I stayed in the big bed for a night, and the overall feeling was not good.The room is super big, and there is a bar, but it is useless for me, and the decoration feels not easy enough.As soon as I entered the room and put down the bag, some ladies called to ask if there is a need for massage services, which makes people wonder if there is any greasy in the hotel.The bathroom bathing water is large, but the bathing supplies are relatively small, but there are a lot of messy things like any condoms, disposable underwear, child, etc.The geographical location is not bad, and the traffic is quite aspect.Another point is that breakfast is relatively average, and the location is too small. After waiting for breakfast for a long time.Supplementary comment on July 13, 2008: Forgot to say that it cost money in the room for long distances, and the broadband Internet is slow."
1,"价格不错,位置不是特别容易找,不过宾馆前台提供的信息很准确,开车很快就找到了.单人间确实只能住一个人,不过条件还不错,建议一个人出差可以去住.","The price is good, the location is not particularly easy to find, but the information provided by the hotel's front desk is very accurate, and it is found quickly when driving. The single room can only live in one person, but the conditions are not bad. It is recommended that a person can live on a business trip."
1,总体上感觉还可以，但也没有什么太突出的地方，因为才过一个月多点，实在也想不起来有什么让人印象深刻点的。,"Overall, it feels okay, but there is nothing too prominent, because it is more than a month, and I can't remember any impressive."
0,结帐的时候刷卡总是刷不过去，为了赶飞机，只好答应他们说走后再解除预授权并结帐，回来两天了酒店也没有主动联系，昨天我打电话过去说还没有弄好，要等周一,"When checking out, swiping the card can't always swipe. In order to catch the plane, they had to promise them to say that they were dismissed and checkout after leaving. The hotel did not take the initiative to contact the hotel for two days.Wait for Monday"
1,"住鸿宾楼客房,感觉比前段时间来住更超值了,发现通道地毯换的很漂亮,有点高星级酒店的感觉,另外房间里都可以提供宽带上网了.住在这样一个在努力进步的酒店,我喜欢","Living in the guest room in Hongbin Building, I feel more value -for -money than living some time ago. I found that the channel carpet is very beautiful. It feels like a high -star hotel. In addition, broadband can be available in the room.Hotel, I like it"
1,"酒店总体可以,出门交通不太方便，离市中心较远，房内设施有点旧,电视机太小且旧,配不上五星级。饮食酒店配套还可以，中式，西式，日式都有。要提的一点就是房间没有提供收费的卫生用品（如一次性毛巾，安全套，清洁洗液等），我打电话要安全套，酒店房间清洁阿姨跟一同童装束的人抢着送来，一问之下每个收费50元，也太贵了，难怪他们抢着送来，可能他们在赚外快，不知道酒店对这方面有没有管理。","The hotel is generally available. The traffic is not convenient to go out. It is far from the city center. The facilities in the house are a bit old. The TV is too small and old. It is not worthy of five stars.Diet hotels are also available, Chinese, Western and Japanese.One thing to mention is that the room does not provide a charge for sanitary products (such as a one -time towel, condom, cleaning washing solution, etc.). I called a condom.It is too expensive to pay 50 yuan each. No wonder they rush to send it. Maybe they are making money. I do n’t know if the hotel has management in this area."
1,"酒店的装修确实还不错,就是前面在修地铁,影响很大,看见这个酒店,坐车最起码还要二十分钟才能到,比较郁闷.","The decoration of the hotel is really good, that is, the subway is in front of the subway, which has a great impact. It takes at least twenty minutes to see the hotel at least 20 minutes. It is more depressed."
0,"服务员不热情,卫生设备有点老化,如莲蓬头的开关调节不灵.补充点评2008年5月27日：路边的车的声音很明显,可能是那两天在试工的原故.","The waiter is not enthusiastic, and the hygiene equipment is a bit aging, such as the switch of the shower head."
1,"刚刚去住过,现在据说是刚刚评上4星,条件还算不错,比我想像的要好,走廊的感应灯和装饰都还不错，就是房间的门差了一点，推也推不开，希望改善，我住的是1320宾馆反馈2008年7月25日：尊敬的客人：您好！感谢您对成都新良大酒店提出宝贵的意见！酒店管理层非常重视客人的意见反馈，已经组织工程部对酒店区域内的硬件设施进行了一次排查，希望下次您入住时能让您有宾至如归的感觉！期待您的光临！","I just went to live, and now it is said that it was just a 4 -star.

1,是宁夏唯一可以住的酒店了，每次都住在这里。,"It is the only hotel in Ningxia, and every time I live here."
1,酒店服务意识很好，很热情，主动介绍酒店的特色。感觉不错。,"The hotel service awareness is very good, very enthusiastic, and actively introduces the characteristics of the hotel.It feels good."
0,"这所酒店永不再采用。我于一周前透过携程预订好6月24日入住一天，竟然在入住当天中午从机场打车到酒店途中，收到携程短讯说：“您预订的6/24入住的杭州最佳西方梅苑宾馆,因政府征用,6/25早上8：30之前必须退房,请知晓”。向携程查询，回说他们也是当天才刚收到酒店的如是通知，而酒店前台亦无法解释为何会有如此安排。作为酒店住客，逗留至中午12：00是最基本的权利，如何能够临时用一个短讯便要求客人提早离开，真是荒谬，亦严重亏损了国际集团之名。怎晓得这酒店日后又会用政府名目亏待住客。虽然在跟酒店一番理论后，前台曾致电到我房间改说会为我特别安排下不用提早离开，这更令人生气，一方面房客要动气争取才给你基本的住宿权利，另一方面原来政府征用之说其实挺有弹性，不一定要执行。携程亦十分不是，怎能接受合作伙伴如此安排，如果酒店有活动不能出租应早作处理，不可能接受预定又出租房间的同时但牺牲客人的最基本的权利，这么晚替酒店发此短讯，而且亦未有主动为客人提供应变安排，只推说是酒店事情，与携程无关，令人难以接受。宾馆反馈2008年8月12日：回复：尊敬的宾客：对此次不应该出现的错误，我们酒店深感遗憾；对给您带来的不愉快经历，在此真诚地表示道歉！衷心期待得到您的谅解和再次地支持！","This hotel will never be adopted.I booked a day of staying on June 24 through Ctrip throughout the week ago. I took a taxi from the airport from the airport to the hotel at noon on the day of staying., Due to the government's collection, check out before 8:30 in the morning at 8:30, please know. ""Inquiry from Ctrip, I said that they had just received the hotel that had just received the hotel that day, and the hotel's front desk could not explain why it was so arranged.As a hotel resident, staying until 12:00 noon is the most basic right. How to temporarily use a SMS to ask guests to leave early. It is ridiculous and seriously lost the name of the international group.How do you know that this hotel will use the government to treat guests at a loss in the future.Although after some theory with the hotel, the front desk called me to renovate my room to tell me that I did n’t have to leave early for me. This is even more angry. On the one handIt turns out that the government's collection is actually very flexible and does not have to be executed.Ctrip is also very not. How can I accept partners such arrangements. If the hotel has activities, it is not possible to handle it early, and it is impossible to accept the predetermined and renting room., And did not take the initiative to provide the guests for the response, only the hotel is in the hotel, which has nothing to do with Ctrip, which is unacceptable.Hotel feedback on August 12, 2008: Reply: Dear guest: We feel deeply regretful about the errors that should not occur this time; we will apologize sincerely to the unpleasant experience brought to you!I sincerely look forward to your understanding and support again!"
0,"我是头一次到九寨沟,通过携程预先订了格桑.去到后发现自己被误导了,这个酒店较旧,感觉很脏,服务一般.旁边有很多酒店,没进去,但感觉比格桑要好.下次去,首选是不住格桑了,挑其他的试试.","I arrived at Jiuzhaigou for the first time, and I booked Gesang in advance through Ctrip.

0,地理位置很好，但酒店房间很潮湿！洗澡水不热！最不能容忍的是没有电视信号！让我错过了欧洲杯的比赛，如果没有电视等同于很烂的小旅馆，酒店就应该在价格上做出很大的让步，可遗憾还是原价．以后绝对不会再次入住此家宾馆！宾馆反馈2008年7月11日：POSH先生，您好！为了提供更多的电视频道徐家汇店在6月底安装了IPTV电视，正好在调试阶段的时候您入住了酒店。很抱歉让您错过了欧洲杯。现在酒店的IPTV电视已经安装完毕，可以看到58个频道以及凤凰卫视等卫星频道，还有各种影视剧点拨的功能。由于酒店安装IPTV电视使您错过了欧洲杯，再次向您道歉，希望您今后还能入住我们酒店。,"The geographical location is good, but the hotel room is very humid!Bathing water is not hot!The most unbearable is no TV signal!Let me miss the European Cup.

1,开发区里首屈一指的酒店，设施、服务都不错。淋浴房够大，但淋浴用品却在浴缸旁边，摆布不是十分合理。境外的电视节目接收效果不好，需要改进。门口的出租都是增城或者周边县市的，所以根本就是侃价不打表。总体够四星水准，下次去开发区还会考虑入住。,"The premier hotels in the development zone are good facilities and services.The shower room is large enough, but the shower supplies are next to the bathtub.The receiving effect of overseas TV programs is not good and needs to be improved.The rental at the door is Zengcheng or the surrounding counties and cities, so it is simply the price.The overall level is enough, and the development zone will be considered next time."

How to do the room type that lived in the previous time was bad ~ The waiter responded not only to the bad attitude, but also the reason for the door to stay in the room.~ I was angry with my girlfriend, so I quickly checked out at 5 am the next day and moved to the Normandy Hotel in Central Street. Although the house prices were more than 20 yuan more, the room type was three times that of this ""rotten"".Many, Normani Hotel is not only good in the location (if you spend 14 yuan from Yuanda to D to Central Street ~ ""), the front desk service is better! ...

1,"酒店很新,服务也很不错,如果要在旺角买东西的话,住这里真不错,先达广场,波鞋街,郎豪坊都非常近,而且离地铁也很近.我春节去的,虽然价钱有点贵,加了HKD100/天升级到32楼的行政楼层,不过房间还是比较小,HK的酒店看来是没办法.总的来说,下次去,还是考虑住这里,相比其他动不动就2000多的酒店,1700左右,五星级,性价比不错.","The hotel is very new and the service is also very good. If you want to buy things in Mong Kok, you live here. It is really good to live here.The price is a bit expensive.

1,"住的时候是4月底，800元一天，第一，大堂气派，第二，房间干净。但，第一，大堂太多蚊子，吃饭时咬了很多包。第二，早上吃早餐，食物上有飞虫。第三，房间内有个夜灯无论如何无法关上，第二天服务员只好拔掉插头，我的一个同事住在别的房间也如此。第四，洗衣，价格贵，但，裤子和衬衣，都是熨烫出三条缝，很尴尬。实在不值800元的五星级。宾馆反馈2007年7月9日：首先代表东莞富盈酒店管理公司感谢下榻我店及给予点评的各位嘉宾,对于各位嘉宾点评到酒店的不足之处,管理公司的领导非常重视并立即做出了相应的更改和改善,对酒店的认同和褒奖,我们将会继续努力和发扬,也会一直关注各位嘉宾的点评,同时望各届人士能继续给予宝贵的意见,我们将竭尽全力做好各项服务工作.","When I lived, it was the end of April, 800 yuan a day, first, lobby style, second, the room was clean.However, first, there are too many mosquitoes in the lobby, and I bite a lot of bags while eating.Second, breakfast in the morning, flying insects on food.Third, there is a night lamp in the room that the night light cannot be turned off. The next day the waiter had to pull out the plug. One of my colleagues lived in other rooms.Fourth, laundry, expensive, but the pants and shirts are ironed out of three seams, which is very embarrassing.It is really worth 800 yuan.Hotel feedback on July 9, 2007: First of all, on behalf of Dongguan Faying Hotel Management Company thanks to our store and the guests who give comments. For the guests' shortcomings of the hotel, the leaders of the management company attach great importance to it and immediately make it.Correspondingly changes and improvements, we will continue to work hard and carry forward the hotel's recognition and praise, and we will always pay attention to the reviews of the guests. At the same time, people will continue to give valuable opinions.Service work."
0,1酒店比较偏打车不方便2酒店楼上有KTV，晚上非常吵，特别是对住在五楼的房客。3前台接待，态度生硬。不太欢迎通过携程网预订的人。接待我的小姐，还给我一张名片，让我订房直接打宾馆电话就可以了。说携程发传真来还要回传比较烦。那位小姐好像姓冯。4房价水份太多。房价标价为516元，但一般预订只要讲价的话通常会以318元成交。5在入住后的第二天，我退房后，因为有事还要入住，前台一听是通过携程订的直接回答没房预订（该市当天并没有什么重大活动，也不是旅游旺季）6房间里的价格比外面高许多，一瓶外面一元钱的矿泉水，房间里标价为5元。而且酒店附近没有购物的地方。7服务意识太差，我询问前台工作人员当地天气预报，回答说是不知道。8早餐较差，部分菜还是冷的该酒店有好的设施但缺乏有效的管理，服务意识较差，甚至有点店大欺客的味道，虽然，它并不是什么大店,"1 Hotel is not convenient to take a car. 2 There are KTV on the hotel. It is very noisy at night, especially for tenants living on the fifth floor.3 The front desk reception, the attitude is stiff.Not very welcome to book through Ctrip.com.I received my lady and gave me a business card, and let me book a hotel call directly.It is more annoying to say that Ctrip Failure is coming back.The lady seemed to be named Feng.4 house prices are too much.The price of house prices is 516 yuan, but it is usually sold for 318 yuan if you are scheduled.5 On the day after check -in, after I got out, I had to stay in the front desk. The front desk was heard by the Ctrip's direct answer.The price inside is much higher than the outside. A bottle of mineral water with one yuan outside has a price of 5 yuan in the room.And there is no shopping near the hotel.7 The service awareness is too poor. I asked the front desk staff the local weather forecast and answered that I didn't know.8 Breakfast is poor, some dishes are still cold, the hotel has good facilities but lacks effective management, poor service awareness, and even a taste of bullying guests. Although it is not a big shop"
1,周末住了两天，确实不错，大堂相当有特色，门童都带着代表威尼斯风情的帽子，服务也很热情，让我回忆起了在威尼斯时的日子；前台放有（蛇果）苹果任住客品尝，我们就吃了几个，呵呵。客房就一般了，不大，卫生间也小，但总体感觉还行。早餐品种还算可以，坐在临窗的位置旁，还真有些许三亚的感觉，哈哈，不过这位置是非吸烟区的。晚上在酒店二楼的V吧玩的很开心，鬼妹好多，客人基本以老外为主，小圆桌最低消费400元，啤酒50元一支，消费还可，不过周末需要50元门票费，提醒最好早点过去，不然没位置！酒店也是洲际集团管理的，我还获得了积分，赞下。入住送了国盘与可爱的小熊，再赞下！,"I lived for two days on the weekend. It is really good. The lobby is quite distinctive. Men children have a hat representing Venice's style. The service is also very enthusiastic. I remember the days when I was in Venice;The residents tasted, we ate a few, huh, huh.The guest rooms are average, not big, and the bathroom is small, but the general feeling is okay.Breakfast varieties are okay. Sitting next to the window, it really feels like Sanya, haha, but this position is a non -smoking area.I played very happily on the V bar on the second floor of the hotel in the evening. There are a lot of ghost girls. The guests are basically foreigners. The minimum consumption of the small round table is 400 yuan, the beer is 50 yuan, and the consumption is available, but the cost of 50 yuan on the weekend, remind youIt's best to pass early, otherwise there is no place!The hotel was also managed by Intercontinental Group. I also got points and praised it.Check in the national market and cute bear, and then praise it!"
0,"建议酒店餐厅预备当地产的酒水,以备外地客人品尝.",It is recommended that the hotel and restaurant prepare the alcohol of the local real estate to taste it.
1,第二次入住该酒店。酒店离地铁四号线东安路站不远，如果打的的话，建议告诉司机说“去龙华医院”，宾馆并不有名，但是隔壁的上海中医药大学龙华医院是挺有名的。,"Check in the hotel for the second time.The hotel is not far from Dong'an Road Station of Metro Line 4. If you play it, it is recommended to tell the driver that ""go to Longhua Hospital"" that the hotel is not famous, but the Longhua Hospital of Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine is quite famous next door."
1,入住了“高级房”，但是觉得房间硬件一般，不是很宽敞。服务还可以。,"I stayed in the ""Advanced House"", but I felt that the hardware of the room was average, not very spacious.The service is okay."
1,我第一天晚上是在森林公园门口的奇林山庄过的，才住了一个晚上，就忙着搬到武陵源宾馆，主要原因是住宿在森林公园门口太不方便，冷冷清清的。人都跑到武陵源景区门口的宾馆了。但是搬进武陵源宾馆，才大喜过望，先将武陵源宾馆的优缺点排列如下：优点：1.地理位置方便――跟景区门口距离不到200米，一眼就可以看到景区门口2.占地面积大，体面舒服――宾馆的占地面积让我吓了一大跳，从门口到前台还有40米。够体面，感觉很好！3.洗手间布局合理，有热水供应，还有个大浴缸――热水供应很足，而大浴缸又能在我们洗完一个舒服的热水澡之后，再泡泡脚。经过了一天的劳累，简直是无比的享受4.餐厅――餐厅手艺不错，而且价格合理。我们第一天在森林公园门口那边吃了2顿馆子，竟然给我们还是隔夜饭！！！！毫不夸张地说，就武陵源宾馆的免费早餐都要在森林公园门口那边100块钱一顿的馆子要吃得好！缺点：隔音――房与房之间的隔音做得不太好。但是，换个角度，也希望同胞们能避免在走廊里，甚至在方面里大声喧哗，武陵源宾馆很多日本人韩国人入住，别在外人面前丢了咱们中国的体面。,"On the first night, I passed the Qilin Villa in front of the forest park. I lived for one night and was busy moving to the Wulingyuan Hotel. The main reason was that it was inconvenient and deserted at the gate of the forest park.Everyone ran to the hotel at the entrance of Wulingyuan Scenic Area.However, it was only pleased to move into the Wulingyuan Hotel. The advantages and disadvantages of Wulingyuan Hotel first were arranged as follows: advantages: 1. Convenient geographical location -less than 200 meters away from the gate of the scenic area.The decent and comfortable -the area of the hotel was startled, and there were 40 meters from the door to the front desk.It feels good enough!3. The layout of the toilet is reasonable, there is hot water supply, and there is a large bathtub -hot water supply is enough, and the large bathtub can take a comfortable hot bath after we take a comfortable hot bath.After a day of fatigue, it is extremely enjoyable. 4. The restaurant -restaurant craftsmanship and reasonable price.On the first day, we ate 2 meals at the door of the forest park, and it was still overnight for us!IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIt is no exaggeration to say that the free breakfast at Wulingyuan Hotel must eat 100 yuan a meal at the door of the forest park!Disadvantages: sound insulation -the sound insulation between the room and the room is not very good.However, from another perspective, I also hope that compatriots can avoid loudly in the corridor and even loudly in the face. Many Japanese Korean people in Wulingyuan Hotel stay in and do not lose our decentness in front of outsiders."
1,"不错的酒店.性价比不错,接待的服务人员态度很好,酒店的位置也不错,交通也方便,下次去还会住.房间很大,不过有一点点旧,最不好的是我住的房间窗外就是马路,隔音不好，有点吵,如果能把这个方面改进的话,是一个很好的酒店.","Good hotel. The cost -effectiveness is good, the reception service staff attitude is very good, the hotel is also good, and the transportation is convenient. I still live in the next time.The road window is the road, the sound insulation is not good, and it is a bit noisy. If you can improve this aspect, it is a good hotel."
1,"性价比还不错,这个价格在北京的西四环,算还可以啦,我住的商务房,感觉还算温暖,服务也还可以,交通不算很方便,自己有车就没问题.","The price / performance ratio is not bad. This price is in the West Fourth Ring Road in Beijing. It is okay. The business house I live is still warm, and the service is okay. The traffic is not very convenient. If you have a car, you will be fine."
1,因为悦华酒店没房间了才通过携程定泉州酒店的。其实泉酒的整体比悦华大气，装修也很讲究，唯一比不过悦华的就是服务和早餐。,"Because the Yuehua Hotel has no room, it passed the Ctrip Dingquan Hotel.In fact, the overall Quanjiu is more atmospheric than Yuehua, and the decoration is also very particular. The only thing that is not comparable to Yuehua is service and breakfast."

0,这个酒店的前身听别人说是乐山驻成都的招待所，现在改成酒店了，房间里面的设施不好，我定的是单人间，居然要穿过他们的前台在后面的一栋单独的楼上去，经过的时候看见那个院子里还有一些别的什么公司，而且还没有电梯，要自己上楼梯；早餐9点就结束了，临走的时候要求打印水单，前台人员说是打印机坏了，没有办法打印；单位要求拿水单和发票报销，郁闷；服务人员也是好像忙得不行的样子，根本就谈不上什么服务质量的高低了，他们的房卡也坏了，房间还是服务员帮着开的门。一句话，别住在这里自寻烦恼了。,"The predecessor of this hotel listened to others that it was the Leshan's guest house in Chengdu. Now it is changed to a hotel. The facilities in the room are not good. I set a single room and actually go through their front desk.When I passed, I saw some other companies in that yard, and there were no elevators, so I had to go to the stairs; the breakfast was over. When I was leaving, I asked to print the water list.There is no way to print; the unit requires the water list and the invoice to be reimbursed, depressed; the service staff also seems to be too busy, and it can not talk about the quality of the service quality. Their room card is also broken. The room still helped the waiter to helpOpen door.In a word, don't live here for trouble."
1,入住了传说中的04房间，景色真的很美，赶上个好天气，蔚蓝尽收眼底：）结帐后，由于工作紧张，将信用卡遗忘在前台，很快携程的工作人员就通知了我，很感谢酒店前台服务员与携程业务员工作认真负责。下次来威海，一定还住这个酒店！,"In the legendary room 04, the scenery was really beautiful. Having caught up with a good weather, the blue seemed to see the foundation :) After the checkout, due to the tight work, the credit card was forgotten at the front desk.Thank you very much for the hotel's front desk and Ctrip salesperson to work seriously and responsible.Next time we come to Weihai, you must still stay in this hotel!"
1,酒店房间较旧，一进门有股味道，墙上也显得较脏。窗户没有纱窗，酒店服务员提醒不要开窗，因为会有蚊子。早餐可在流花厅用餐，但是是粤式早茶型，但是人比较多，多是旅行社团组用餐，所以候时较长。本酒店和旅行社签有协议，我们办理入住的时候，正好赶上2个旅行团到达办理入住，前台人员一片忙乱。也影响了我们的及时入住。酒店的外部环境还可以，早上可漫步在园内。,"The hotel room is older, and the door has a flavor as soon as it enters the door, and it looks dirty on the wall.The window has no screens, and the hotel waiter reminds not to open the window because there will be mosquitoes.Breakfast can be dine in the Liuhua Hall, but it is a Cantonese -style morning tea type, but there are more people. Most of them are dining in the travel community group, so they are longer.The hotel and travel agencies signed an agreement. When we handled them, we just caught up with two travel groups to arrive in handling, and the front desk staff was busy.It also affected our timely check -in.The external environment of the hotel is okay, and you can stroll in the garden in the morning."
0,"还不如直接到那里找个导游去订都比携程订的便宜,导游说十一他们能拿到300元的价格,携程给我的价格太高了","It's better to go directly to find a tour guide to order it cheaper than Ctrip. The tour guide said that eleven they can get the price of 300 yuan, and the price given me by Ctrip is too high."
1,房间的配套有小厨房，方便做宵夜。^_^。而且离火车站超级近，就算是去shopping买一大堆，也可以很晚才去做直通车。,"The room is a small kitchen, which is convenient for supper.^_^.And it is super close to the train station. Even if you go to Shopping to buy a lot, you can go through the traffic very late."
0,特价房非常小四步走到房间墙角基本是用不隔音的板材隔出来的隔壁的电视声音还有临近房间夜晚男女做事的呻吟和同浴的声音都能很清楚的听见简直就是网友见面的炮房房间里空气质量很差且无法通过换气排出携程价格与门市价相同主要考虑办事地点在附近才去住的,"The special room is very small four steps to walk to the corner of the room. Basically, the TV sound of the TV next door with no sound insulation and the moaning of men and women in the room at night and the sound of the same bathing.The air quality in the room is very poor and cannot be discharged by ventilation. The price of Ctrip is the same as the store price."
1,服务人员的业务能力还有待改进住了前三天都有早餐券，第四天续房时，把已经给我的房卡和餐卷中的餐卷给又抽回去了，说你这个价格不含早餐。给我的感觉非常不爽，而且言语很坚决。我商量了很久，告诉他们第二天有客人要过来，需要在餐厅吃饭，况且我要订三间房续订2天，你就当赠送也不是不可以的。死活不同意，我很是生气，让请示经理，才勉强同意说只允许一天的。感觉不满。,"The business ability of the service staff has to be improved for breakfast vouchers in the first three days. On the fourth day, the room card and the meal scroll that I have given me was pulled back again.Including breakfast.It feels very uncomfortable for me, and the words are very determined.I discussed it for a long time and told them that the guests came over the next day and needed to eat in the restaurant. Besides, I would like to order three rooms for 2 days, and it is not impossible for you to give it.I disagreed with life, I was very angry, so I asked the manager to barely agree to say that only one day was allowed.I feel dissatisfied."
1,安静乾净价格公道窗外的景致不错如果你要安静的住宿环境可以选择它,"The quiet and clean price is good outside the window. If you want to be quiet accommodation environment, you can choose it"
0,1、虽然离鲁迅故里近，但故里的商贩晚上并不营业，整个故里晚上也没有灯光；咸亨酒店只提供套餐，三人套餐360多元，绍兴的水乡风光已不复存在，故住在此处的意义值得重新权衡。2、不能叫三轮车夫帮你找酒店，据三轮车夫说，帮顾客拉到客栈，客栈给车夫回扣20元。3、客栈无法提供24小时热水。4、房间不干净，设施陈旧且摆放的电脑形同虚设，根本不能用。5、门、窗均关不紧，属老宅，但与大理、丽江的民宅改造的酒店截然不同，胆小的要慎重考虑，免得睡不踏实。6、客栈承诺的24小时免费接送站服务是：接：需到火车站或客运中心后再与客栈联系，并要计划好等待时间；送：早晨8：00后才行，要赶火车、汽车的需提前与客栈预约；早餐需到7：30才提供。,"1. Although it is close to Lu Xun's hometown, the vendors in the reason are not open at night, and there is no lighting in the evening at night.The significance deserves re -weighing.2. You can't ask the tricycle to help you find a hotel. According to the tricycle, help the customer to the inn, and the inn will return 20 yuan to the driver.3. Inn cannot provide 24 -hour hot water.4. The room is not clean, the facilities are old and the computers are used in the same way, and it cannot be used at all.5. The doors and windows are not closed, which are old houses, but they are completely different from the hotels of the houses in Dali and Lijiang. They must consider it with timidity, so as not to sleep well.6. The 24 -hour free pick -up service promised by the inn is: connect: need to go to the train station or the passenger center, and then contact the inn in the passenger center, and plan to wait for the waiting time; send it: after 8:00 in the morning.You need to make an appointment with the inn in advance; breakfast must be provided until 7:30."
1,1.位置很好，就在中街上，出入方便；2.房间比较大，尤其是卫生间，装修风格分为金木水火土，不错；3.前台服务一般，入住后发现网络不通，工程人员能及时赶到解决问题，但又发现卫生间内没有梳子，通知前台，看来是忘记放了，好在还能及时送来。4.客房玻璃比较脏，在高层本想俯瞰沈阳，可惜这玻璃太扫兴。5.晚上过了8点去21层巴烤，竟然不营业了，郁闷！,"1. The location is very good, just on the middle street, it is convenient to enter and exit; 2. The room is relatively large, especially the bathroom. The decoration style is divided into gold, wood, water, fire, and soil.I can get to solve the problem in time, but I find that there are no comb in the bathroom. I notify the front desk. It seems that I have forgotten to put it. Fortunately, I can still send it in time.4. The glass glass is dirty. I want to overlook Shenyang at the high level. Unfortunately, this glass is too clean.5. After 8 o'clock in the evening, go to 21 layers of baked baked."
1,这次在新疆出差，先后两次入住该酒店，总的来说是家不错的酒店，干净整洁，房间电源插座比较多，用起来比较方便，就是卫生间比较小，有些不太方便，值得一说的是前台的服务。第一次入住时两个态度都很好，可第二次入住时，换了一个服务人员，态度却一点也不好，反差非常明显，入住时预定好了早餐（因为要赶飞机），早上催送时，却说携程预定的没有，后来我让她打电话问晚上接待的，又说可以，结果送来两个冰凉的面包和牛奶（第一次预定时送来的时后都是预热过的，那时感觉非常好）。送来的服务生面孔也是凉凉的感觉，好像很不情愿，我非常气愤！结帐时，发票和水单连折也不折，更谈不上装信封了。看来，人员的素质还是离他的星级还有很大的差距啊！,"This time in Xinjiang, I stayed in the hotel twice. Generally speaking, it is a good hotel. It is clean and tidy. The room has a lot of power sockets. It is more convenient to use.It is the front desk service.At the first time I stayed, the two attitudes were very good. However, when I stayed for the second time, I changed the service staff, but the attitude was not good at all.When reminding me, I said that Ctrip was booked. Later, I asked her to call and ask the reception at night.I felt very good at that time).The sending the waiter's face is also cool, as if he was reluctant, I was very angry!At the checkout, the invoice and the water order are not folded, let alone the attachment.It seems that the quality of the personnel is still there is still a big gap between his star!"
1,我5月21日入住，22日离开，月底公司报销，财务认为：酒店的发票，盖章已经模糊，需要重开。我在出差，于是委托公司财务于5月28日将模糊不清楚的发票寄给了前厅部叶先生。6月11日，公司财务还是没有收到重新开具的发票----------着急啊，我！补充点评2008年6月18日：6月18日，总算收到发票了，感谢酒店叶先生，也要强烈抗议中国邮政，嘉兴至上海的挂号信竟然会需要如此久的时间。,"I stayed on May 21 and left on the 22nd. At the end of the month, the company reimbursed. Finance believes that the hotel invoice has been blurred and needs to be reopen.I was on a business trip, so I entrusted the company to finance the fuzzy invoice to Mr. Ye Ye on May 28.On June 11, the company's finances still did not receive a re-issued invoice -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- way of anxiety, I!Supplementary comment on June 18, 2008: On June 18th, I finally received the invoice. Thank you Mr. Ye, the hotel, and the Chinese Postal Post. The registered letter from Jiaxing to Shanghai will take such a long time."
1,酒店的床比一般的香港酒店大，双人房的床都很大，枕头超多超舒服。酒店正好在金钟的正上方，逛街很方便，东西买了直接就丢回房间再出来超方便。最特别的是晚上逛街回房间又累又渴，桌子上放着泡好的香片茶，非常温馨！国内酒店的服务就缺乏这种细节，下次还要住这里。,"The hotel's bed is larger than the ordinary Hong Kong hotel, the beds in the double room are large, and the pillows are super comfortable.The hotel is just above Jin Zhong. It is very convenient to go shopping. It is very convenient to throw it back to the room after buying things.The most special thing is that they are tired and thirsty when they go shopping at night. There are brewed scent tea on the table, which is very warm!The service of domestic hotels lacks such details, and I will live here next time."
1,房间旧了，马桶竟然冲不去，只好换房，有服务员协助周一上午有升旗仪式，国营的风格,"The room is old, and the toilet cannot be rushed, so I have to change the house. Some waiters assist in the flag -raising ceremony on Monday morning. The state -owned style"
1,就莆田地区总体水平来看，强烈推荐，性价比很高，五一期间入住居然没有涨价，周边环境很方便，在对面巷子里吃的刘备烤鱼（川菜）味道不错。,"From the perspective of the overall level of the Putian area, it is highly recommended. The cost performance is very high. There is no price increase during May 1st. The surrounding environment is very convenient. Liu Bei grilled fish (Sichuan cuisine) eats in the alley on the opposite side tastes good."
1,这是我第二次住悦达酒店，这里环境和地理位置都还好，价格、服务和高层的房间环境等等性价比还是很高的。特别说的是床睡得非常舒服，很喜欢。另外离农民美食街很近，非常值得推荐！,"This is the second time I stayed at the Houda Hotel. The environment and geographical location here are okay. The price, service and high -rise room environment and other cost -effectiveness are still very high.Special saying is that the bed sleeps very comfortably and likes it very much.In addition, it is close to the Farmers Food Street, and it is worth recommending!"
1,房间整洁，交通便利，服务态度好，该酒店的豪华房配备的按摩椅相当有特色，也很实用。,"The room is clean, the transportation is convenient, and the service attitude is good. The massage chair of the luxury room of the hotel is quite unique and practical."
0,酒店很新并且很有档次和气派，主楼设计和总体设备设施让人感觉非常不错，周遍是一个广场，视线很开阔。但令人非常愤怒的是，为什么通过携程网预订的客房总是常常被安排在不方正的――床和电视机等客房设施都歪歪扭扭摆放的房间（1710房），真的不止一个客人反映这样的问题，携程网的客人一样付钱消费，为什么会受到不公正的待遇？！难道就是因为那40元/间.晚的返佣费给的不甘心？！酒店在争创五星，应该做到给每一位客人提供最优质最满意的服务，否则受到伤害的顾客永不会再光顾，何况现在酒店这么多……望酒店领导能重视这个问题，解决这个尴尬的局面，真正让酒店在硬件和软件都上五星。,"The hotel is new and very graded and elegant. The main building design and overall equipment and facilities make people feel very good. It is a square that is very open.But what is very angry is why the rooms booked through Ctrip.com are always often arranged in the ingot -rooms such as beds and televisions (room 1710) in room facilities.In this question, the guests of Ctrip.com pay for consumption like it, why is it treated with unfair treatment?IntersectionIs it because of the 40 yuan/room.IntersectionThe hotel is fighting for the five -star, and should provide the best and most satisfactory service to every guest, otherwise the harmful customers will never patronize, not to mention that there are so many hotels now ... I hope that the hotel leaders can pay attention to this problem and solve this to solve thisThe embarrassing situation really allows the hotel to be five stars in hardware and software."
1,还不错，海景房间有些小，其实如果对大海审美疲劳的可以住山景，便宜还宽敞,"It's not bad. There are small seascape rooms. In fact, if you can live in the mountains if you are fatigue for the sea, you can live in the mountains, which is cheap and spacious."
0,"虽然预定比较方便，但是宾馆的对顾客的关怀不足，房间冷得让人睡不着觉服务人员还说暖和的！！！宾馆反馈2008年5月4日：首先感谢您入住汇宾楼,并给我们提出问题.由于五台山的海拔高,气候潮湿温差较大,酒店由于冬天停业,开业后房间的温度夜间可能会有点凉.给您带来的不便酒店深感歉意.","Although it is more convenient to book, the hotel's lack of care for customers, the room is so cold that people can't sleep with the service staff and say warmth!IntersectionIntersectionHotel feedback on May 4, 2008: First of all, thank you for staying in Huibin Tower and asking us questions.

1,民族风味食品很不错，价格也公道。威尼斯西餐太糟！切牛扒的刀，老婆建议改用用锯！还有速度慢的吓死人！房间只要不是太挑剔，绝对算过得去（偶住豪大间）。卫生间比房间装修得好！房间送餐一是速度慢（送餐，收餐都慢，怀疑是服务生是蜗牛转世），二是价格太离谱！总台一位服务小姐态度非常好（忘记看工号），赞一个！酒店位置离机场极近！15大米搞定！总体说来还是不错，吃饭提前点叫，还行！,"The national flavor food is very good and the price is fair.Venice Western food is too bad!Cut the beef steak knife, my wife recommends switching to the saw!There are also slow and scary people!As long as the room is not too picky, it is absolutely available (occasionally living in the great room).The bathroom is better than the room decoration!The food delivery is slow (the meal delivery, the meal is slow, and the doubt is that the waiter is the reincarnation of the snail), and the second is that the price is too outrageous!A service lady in the main station is very good (forgot to watch the job number), like one!The hotel location is very close to the airport!15 rice!Generally speaking, it is still good."
0,酒店房间设施陈旧，尤其卫生间设置不合理，洗澡很不方便。前台服务人员态度极其冷淡。,"The hotel room facilities are old, especially the bathroom settings are unreasonable, and it is inconvenient to take a bath.The attitude of the front desk service staff was extremely cold."
1,已经住过多次了，还是一个字：好！服务好，环境好！服务人性化，房间虽然小些，但对我足够了。一点儿遗憾是没有免费的矿泉水。早餐不错，很丰盛尤其是有一些小笼，像南方的早茶了。对于3星级有此早餐很好了。携程的价格还是稍差一些，我以其他公司协议价住过要更便宜些。总的讲：下次还住，还推荐其它同事住。,"I have lived many times, it is still a word: OK!Good service, good environment!Serving humane, although the room is small, it is enough to me.There is no free mineral water at all.Breakfast is good, very rich, especially some small cages, like morning tea in the south.It is good for 3 stars to have this breakfast.Ctrip's price is still slightly worse. I have a cheaper price for other companies.Generally speaking: I still live next time, and I also recommend other colleagues."

1,于四月下旬入住行政楼套房三天原则上大致还算满意，但仍有以下看法一、或许装修较久走道与厨房有些许霉味，厨房设备也较久有严重泛黄二、电梯与住户共用仅两台有时要等较久时间三、从电梯到前台需经过一个六阶左右之小楼梯有些许不方便四、居住上是还算方便对面不远就是吉之岛五、如果能提供简易锅具，中我想更能符合套昂设备之定义宾馆反馈2008年5月16日：感谢您选择入住万事达酒店及给予酒店宝贵的建议。酒店现有简易厨具提供，由于数量有限，一般在客人需要的情况下免费提供锅具、餐具给客人使用。希望您的再次选择入住万事达酒店。,"In late April, the three -day in principle was quite satisfactory to the executive building suite, but there are still the following views. Perhaps the long -term decoration aisle and the kitchen are a little moldy, and the kitchen equipment is severely yellowed.Only two units are sometimes waiting for a long time. From the elevator to the front desk, you need to pass through a small staircase of about sixth steps. It is not convenient. Four. It is convenient to live.In China, I think it can be more in line with the definition of the set of equipment.The current simple kitchen utensils are provided by the hotel. Due to the limited number, it is generally provided for guests and tableware for guests when the number of guests is needed.I hope you choose to stay in the MasterCard again."
1,比想象中要好.呵呵.服务热情周到.客房舒适.就是早餐品种稍微少了点.住店客人停车要30元/晚.不太划算.,It's better than expected. Haha. The service is warm and thoughtful. The room is comfortable. The breakfast varieties are slightly less. The store guests cost 30 yuan/night. Not very cost -effective.
1,"这家是我在太原住的性价比比较好的酒店,但是上次入住找服务员单独要了一床被子,气味极其不好,与酒店不相称,而且没有早餐,建议携程考虑和酒店协调一下.",This is a hotel with a better price -performance ratio of my indigenous.
1,性价比还可以，大堂装修富丽堂皇，房间比较豪华，配套完善！,"The price -performance ratio is okay. The lobby is decorated with a magnificent, the room is relatively luxurious, and the supporting facilities are perfect!"
1,"住了三天,感觉服务还可以,晚上的自助餐还不错.","After staying for three days, I feel that the service is okay. The buffet at night is not bad."
1,感觉比夏天去海边好，入住率比我想象要多一些，很安静,It feels better than going to the sea in summer.
1,该酒店地理位置较好，比较干净，可以上网，单间内竟然还提供电脑。在拉萨市来说比较难得！补充点评2007年10月30日：2楼的火锅城，味道不怎么样。火锅城演艺时间太长，影响休息。,"The hotel has a good geographical location and is relatively clean. You can go to the Internet.It's rare for Lhasa!Supplementary comment on October 30, 2007: The hot pot city on the 2nd floor, the taste is not good.Hot pot city acting time is too long, affecting rest."
1,很不错的酒店，物超所值。环境幽雅，设施完善，适合休闲度假。服务员训练有素，待人接物及介绍酒店相关信息非常专业。下次来苏州肯定会再次入住。美中不足的是所订的两间房有一间临街，凌晨车辆穿梭就很吵闹。,"Very good hotel, value for money.The environment is elegant, the facilities are perfect, and it is suitable for leisure vacation.The waiter is well -trained. It is very professional to treat people and introduce hotel -related information.The next time you come to Suzhou, you will definitely stay in again.The disadvantage is that the two rooms that are scheduled to have a street, and the vehicle shuttles in the early morning are noisy."
1,"没有想到,这是一间超水准的3星级酒店.很喜欢它的木板地面,不像地毯,没有异味.而且房间相当干净,也没有什么卫生死角.服务态度也很好,大堂很舒适.地点真的没有话说了,超级方便,去哪里都行.总的来说很超值.就是卫生间的排水好像差了一点,但是很多酒店都这样的.","Unexpectedly, this is an ultra -level 3 -star hotel. I like its wooden plates very much, unlike a carpet, no odor. And the room is quite clean, there is no health and death corner. The service attitude is also very good. The lobby is very comfortable.There is really nothing to say about the location. It is super convenient. Everywhere you go. In general, it is great. It seems that the drainage in the bathroom seems to be a little bit worse, but many hotels are like this."
1,很适宜居住，环境幽静，服务台较好。我满意,"Very suitable living, quiet environment, good service desk.I am satisfied"
0,这个酒店除了位置好点，没有其他的优势了。我住的所谓的行政间在三楼，房间很小，设施很差，隔壁的总统套间还经常有人打麻将，影响休息。其他附近的挂牌三星的国防宾馆等都比他好很多，360的价钱简直是欺负人，不通过携程还能便宜点。上位朋友说的二楼商务中心的刘先生也不地道，散客的拼团价格他能宰你绝对不手软，林芝二日游别的人团费320元，他收你500元，黑的很补充点评2007年7月18日：一直很忙，今天上来要说几句。酒店的郑董事长对于我的散客拼团费用问题作了解释，也作了道歉，并汇款退回了400元，对此我真的表示感谢，只要有这样对客人诚恳真挚的态度，我想会有更多朋友去光顾闽泰酒店的，也祝酒店生意兴隆,"This hotel has no other advantages except for the better location.The so -called administrative room I live in is on the third floor. The rooms are small and the facilities are poor. The presidential suite next door often hits mahjong and affects rest.The other nearby Samsung's national defense hotels are much better than him. The price of 360 is simply a bully, and it can be cheaper without Ctrip.Mr. Liu, the second floor of the business center, said that the second floor of the business center is not authentic. He can slaughter you at the price of the group of scattered customers. You must not be soft. The group fee for Nyingchi for a two -day tour is 320 yuan. He collects you 500 yuan.Supplementary comment July 18, 2007: I have been busy, I will say a few words today.Chairman Zheng of the hotel explained and apologized for the cost of spelling the group groups, and returned 400 yuan for remittance. I really thanked this. As long as I have a sincere and sincere attitude towards the guests, I think I thinkThere will be more friends who visit the Minteai Hotel, and I wish the hotel business for a prosperity"
1,设施、服务与五星的浙江宾馆差不多了，整体感觉不错，早餐花样挺多，空调效果也不错，唯一一点遗憾的是2月9日的晚餐很不满意，加份的菜卖完了，米饭吃完了，等面条等了半小时，服务生一直说在锅里煮。看着唯一的一个服务生上窜下跳的，我们忍不住对他说：“你辛苦了，是不是新来的”，他点点头,"The facilities, services are almost the same as the five -star Zhejiang Hotel. The overall feels good, the breakfast is quite a lot, the air conditioning effect is also good. The only regret is that the dinner on February 9 is very dissatisfied.After finishing the noodles, the waiter kept cooking in the pot.Looking at the only waiter jumping up and down, we couldn't help saying to him, ""You have worked hard, is it new?"" He nodded"
1,送的水果很不错，房间1般，没什么特别的，不过早餐很难吃,"The fruit sent is very good, the room is 1, there is nothing special, but the breakfast is difficult to eat"
1,"酒店checkin,checkout很快；客房服务员态度很热情；餐厅的服务很好，食物也很不错；酒店地理位置很好。","The hotel checkin, checkout is very fast; the guest room waiter attitude is very enthusiastic; the restaurant has good service and good food; the hotel's geographical location is good."
0,客房和前台服务都不错但酒店太陈旧，房间不如一般3星宾馆，阳台卫生间极小位置也不好，花园泳池都很小尤其要说的是酒店花园里的餐厅，叫东海渔家还是东海渔村的太黑了市场8元一斤的海瓜子，他卖50元一斤，还少秤味道也差一盘炒黄瓜要18元根本是露天排档的环境，桌子都脱漆摇晃了很过分,"The guest rooms and front desk services are good, but the hotel is too old. The room is not as good as that of a 3 -star hotel. The small position of the balcony bathroom is not good. The garden swimming pool is very small. In particular, it is a restaurant in the hotel garden.It ’s too dark to sell 8 yuan a pound of sea melon seeds. He sells 50 yuan a pound, and the taste of less scales is not a plate of fried cucumber. 18 yuan is basically an open -air stall environment."
0,"我是2007年10月2日至10月5日入住的绿色标间,其实来之前就没有对这个酒店抱很高的期望,毕竟只是不到两百元一天的价格,我也没有过高的要求,只希望房间干净一些就可以了.没想到,入住之后还是很失望.主要有以下几方面:第一,因为我们被安排在七楼(基本是最高楼层了),可能太高了水压不够吧,淋浴的热水小得可怜,而且洗着洗着就没水了,第一天向服务台反映之后,他们承诺说会设法解决,结果没有任何改变.第二天洗澡时还是只有很小的热水,五分钟后干脆只有冷水了,我们去的时间已接近深秋,用冷水淋浴的滋味实在很不爽!!第二,房间打扫的速度很慢,开始不知道,后来才明白酒店本身没有洗衣房,所有需要更换的床单和浴巾都是中午12点才从外面送来,所以即使你一早出门时就挂牌让他们打扫,也要等到中午之后.第三,早餐,虽然按酒店的规格,这里的早餐质量也在意料之中,我对早餐的种类也还算满意.但是供应的时间就比较夸张,只从7点到9点,其实8点半之后去,大多食物都是冷的了,而且品种也不齐全了,所以基本上只是你稍微晚起几分钟就没有早餐吃了.第四,房间的电话,我入住的三晚,每晚都会有自称是""洗浴中心""的人打电话过来问是否需要""服务"",这说明酒店的管理极差,根本达不到三星的标准.一般稍微好一些的酒店是不可能""放""这类电话进客房的.","I am from the green standard room from October 2nd to October 5th, 2007. In fact, there was no high expectations for this hotel before it came. After all, it was only less than two hundred yuan a day.Ask, I just hope that the room is cleaner. I didn't expect it to be disappointed after check -in. There are several aspects: First, because we are arranged on the seventh floor (basically the highest floor), it may be too high to be too high.Not enough, the hot water of the shower is so pitiful, and there is no water when washing. After the first day, they promised that they would try to solve it. As a result, there was no change.Small hot water, only cold water after five minutes, the time we went to is close to late autumn, and the taste of shower with cold water is really uncomfortable! Second, the room was cleaned very slowly.There is no laundry room, all the sheets and bath towels that need to be replaced are delivered from the outside at 12 noon, so even if you go out early in the morning, you will be cleaned, and you have to wait until noon.The quality of breakfast here is also expected, and I am also satisfied with the type of breakfast.And the variety is not complete, so basically you have no breakfast for a few minutes late. Fourth, the room of the room, I stay in three nights, there will be people who claim to be a ""bath center"" every night.Calling to ask if you need ""service"", which shows that the hotel's management is very poor, and the standard of Samsung cannot be met at all. Generally, it is impossible for hotels to ""put"" the guest room."
1,这次是308的行政大床，总体感觉非常不错，就是价格稍许高了点，旁边有个五星的豪华客房才398。估计小天鹅也只有这个房型以上的，看得过去，以前住过的房间实在是很差。以后大家如果要住这里，还是选这个行政大床吧！,"This time is the 308 administrative bed. The overall feels very good, that is, the price is slightly higher. There is a five -star luxury room next to 398.It is estimated that Little Swan has only this room type or above. It can be seen in the past. The rooms that have been living before are really poor.If you want to live here in the future, choose this administrative bed!"
1,房间还可以网络也不错夜总会生意也不错只有一点这次交押金时候是刷我的信用卡预授权结帐是用现金结算的结果预授权的金额没有给我刷回来等收到账单才知道那部分信用额度被冻结了宾馆反馈2008年6月27日：感谢您的点评。有关信用卡预授权这件事真的很抱歉，是我们的服务没有做到位，没能在您离店时及时帮您取消预授权以至于带来了很多的不便，望请谅解，但您请放心，一个月后，预授权会自动解除。真诚的希望您能给我们再次为您服务的机会。,"The room can also be good on the Internet. Night always good business is good. Only a little bit. This time, when the deposit is paid, the pre -authorized checkout of my credit card is pre -authorized by the result of cash settlement.The quota was frozen for the hotel feedback on June 27, 2008: Thank you for your comments.Relevant credit card pre -authorization is really sorry. It is that our service has not been in place. If you fail to help you cancel the pre -authorization in time when you leave the store, you will have a lot of inconvenience.After one month, pre -authorization will be lifted automatically.Sincerely hope that you can give us opportunities for you again."

0,携程的工作人员号称是按4星标准建，就非常放心的预订了，结果让人大跌眼镜。房间很小，卫生间设施一塌糊涂，热水龙头和下水都是坏的，叫来工作人员修了半天。房间设施完全不是想象中的4星，充其量2星最多。checkout的查房也是一阵苦等。服务态度也只是一般，让doorboy叫车，结果还是要自己拎着包走去街边等。第二天就换了皇冠假日，天壤之别！不推荐住此家,"Ctrip's staff claims to be built according to the 4 -star standard, and it is very assured to book, and the result is surprising.The room was very small, the bathroom facilities were messy. The hot water faucet and the launch were bad.The room facilities are not imagined 4 stars at all, at best 2 stars.Checkout's inspection room is also suffering for a while.The service attitude is just average, so that DOORBOY calls a car, but as a result, he still has to walk to the street with his own bag.I changed the crown holiday the next day.Not recommended to live in this family"
0,尽管是四星的宾馆，但这里的服务员都不会笑，不知是何原因！！早餐差劲不说，冰冷的馒头要求打热一下都遭到拒绝。服务太差！和四星的标准根本不符。,"Although it is a four -star hotel, the waiters here will not laugh, I don't know why!IntersectionBetter breakfast is not bad, the cold hoe is rejected by the request to heat up.The service is too bad!It does not match the standards of the four -star."
0,房间还可以，比较大，但是临近马路，早上被车辆声音吵醒了，还有就是桑拿浴室不好，洗了一次澡，我和朋友损失200块钱，怀疑那里有人偷钱，如果各位朋友去，千万不要带现金。,"The room is okay, it is relatively large, but near the road, I was awakened by the vehicle sound in the morning, and the sauna bathroom was not good. After taking a bath, my friend and I lost 200 yuan and suspected that someone would steal money. If you friends go,Don't bring cash."
1,位置很好，房间宽敞。只是有点霉味。七星岩西门，不太好找,"The location is very good and the room is spacious.It's just a little moldy.Qixingyan West Gate, it's not easy to find"
1,"5.12地震当天上午入住，喜来登得当的应急措施和诚恳的服务让我们感动！特别是前厅部的丁经理，能真正急客户所急提供帮助！！再次表示衷心感谢！宾馆反馈2008年7月24日：感谢您的点评,我们期待您下次的光临,并为您提供优质的服务.","5.12 Stay in the morning on the morning of the earthquake, Sheraton's proper emergency measures and sincere services moved us!In particular, Manager Ding in the front hall can truly help the customer urgently!IntersectionThank you again!Hotel feedback on July 24, 2008: Thank you for your comments. We look forward to your next visit and provide you with high -quality services."
1,"在沙区算是很好的了.因为在沙区办事,所以只好选这了.","It is very good in the sandy area. Because I work in the sandy area, I have to choose this."
0,房间有味道，服务实在不敢恭维，预订的房间给卖掉，好在给免费升级，还算不错。就是实在可气的是退房后我忘在酒店了衣服，在前台办理手续的时候不予提醒归还，行李存放了将近三个小时后依然没有归还，直到我离开哈尔滨后回到父母家里两天后整理行李的时候才发现，电话过去才说有看到衣服，这样的服务实在是太差，衣服给我寄回来还要我支付快递费用。,"The room has a taste, and the service is really not compliment. The booking room is sold. Fortunately, it is not bad to upgrade for free.It ’s really angry that after checking out, I forgot to have clothes in the hotel. I do n’t remind them when I go through the procedures at the front desk. I still did n’t return the luggage after nearly three hours.When I sorted out my luggage, I found that the phone passed and said that I saw clothes. Such a service was too bad. I sent me the clothes and asked me to pay the courier fee."
0,酒店外面的马路正在封路大维修，出入非常不方便！房间隔音不好！网速白天还可以、晚上很慢！最不好的是整个厕所及洗浴间是用玻璃做的，但玻璃的磨沙部份很少，并且磨沙中间还有几条透明缝隙。如果有异性客人来访，根本是不可能上厕所及洗浴的。房间里只有一张椅子，没有小桌子，来访客人只能坐在床上聊天，茶水只能放在床头的小柜子上。但这时候大家要千万小心！！！这小柜子很少，柜子上还放了一本相对比较大酒店的介绍。如果你不小心把茶水弄到那本酒店介绍书上。你就不好意思了。那怕只是湿了好几页的边。你都要赔偿20元！宾馆反馈2008年6月18日：由于酒店给您入住造成不便表示歉意！酒店为了保护个人隐私，已经专门配备了外围浴帘，可以很好解决卫生间透明问题；现在酒店二楼餐厅配备啤酒、软饮是您会客的理想场所。欢迎您的再次入住，提出宝贵意见。,"The road outside the hotel is being repaired by the road, and it is very inconvenient to enter and exit!The room sound insulation is not good!The Internet speed is okay during the day, it is very slow at night!The most bad thing is that the entire toilet and bathroom are made of glass, but the sandal sandal part of the glass is very small, and there are still a few transparent gaps in the middle of the sand grinding.If there is a visiting guest from the opposite sex, it is impossible to go to the toilet and bath.There is only one chair in the room, there is no small table. Visitors can only sit in bed and chat. Tea can only be placed on the small cabinet on the bedside.But at this time, everyone must be careful!IntersectionIntersectionThere are very few cabinets, and there is a relatively large hotel introduction on the cabinet.If you accidentally get the tea on the hotel to introduce the book.You are embarrassed.I'm afraid it's just a few pages of wetness.You have to compensate 20 yuan!Hotel feedback on June 18, 2008: apologetic due to inconvenience caused by the hotel!In order to protect personal privacy, the hotel has been equipped with peripheral shower curtains to solve the problem of transparent bathroom transparency. Now the restaurant on the second floor of the hotel is equipped with beer and soft drinks.Welcome to stay again and make valuable comments."
1,满意服务超出预料的好男友之前住过说看到评价服务可比香格里拉哈哈哈房间整洁连茶叶都放着四种不同口味的贴心细心下回来济南首选哟啦啦啦,The good boyfriend who has been satisfied with the expected service has lived before and said that he saw the evaluation service than the Shangri -Lahahaha room tidy in the room.
1,从上环地铁站走路前往的话比较远，建议打车或坐公车；我在预定的时候要求高层无烟房，入住的时候已近24：00，没想到酒店还是保留了高层无烟房给我，对于这一点，我很满意也对酒店的专业表示致敬，毕竟以前我遇到过很多所谓的房间已满，只能给您XXXX的房间之类的话。至于房间设施，觉得比较老，布局挺老式的；我不算太喜欢；但是在HK算大的；和我住的另一家帝豪奥运酒店比起来，觉得房间稍差了些；不过早上有shuttlebus到中环，还不错。,"If you walk from the Sheung Wan Metro Station, it is relatively far away. It is recommended to take a taxi or take a bus; I ask the high -rise smokeless house when I am scheduled. It is nearly 24:00 when I check in. I did not expect the hotel to keep the high -rise smokeless house for me.For this, I am very satisfied with paying tribute to the hotel's professionalism. After all, I have encountered many so -called rooms before, and I can only give you XXXX rooms.As for the room facilities, I feel older and the layout is quite old; I don't like it too much; but in HK, it is big; compared with the other Emperor Olympic hotel I live in, I feel that the room is slightly worse;Central, pretty good."

1,我们于17日下午从迪斯尼好莱坞酒店来到市区入住这家饭店，饭店在一个胡同里面，没来过的还真不见得能很方便的找到。办理的速度很快，态度也很好，大约5分钟就搞定。来到房间后让我们有点不适应，因为真的很小，尤其是刚住过迪斯尼好莱坞酒店，房间面积大约只有10平米左右，卫生间大约3平米，显得有点旧，但吹风机、浴衣都有。饭店的服务人员态度很好，向他们打听些事情他们都会仔细解答，并提供建议。这家饭店的位置很好，距离地铁站和SOGO大约步行7分钟，距离时代广场大约步行15分钟，地处繁华地带，又闹中取静。出大门向左230米就是公车站，去各处非常方便，每人才2-4块钱。我们在市区呆了2天，充分享受了地理位置的优越。在香港我们没有乘坐过地铁，因为在熟悉周围环境后，我们觉得做地面交通更方便。我们去太平山看香港夜景时乘坐的就是有轨电车，不仅方便便宜，还能欣赏香港的街景。19号走时订购了机场送机服务，每人70块，非常值。因为打车到机场要300快，坐地铁也要大约200块，而且不用自己拉着行李到处跑。大型豪华旅游车，宽大的皮座椅，车上一共才7个人，真是太爽了，推荐大家采用。,"On the afternoon of the 17th, we came to the urban area from the Hollywood Hotel in Disney to this hotel. The restaurant was in an alley. It was not necessarily easy to find it.The handling speed is very fast and the attitude is also very good, and it will be done in about 5 minutes.After coming to the room, it made us a little uncomfortable, because it was really small, especially the Hollywood hotel just lived in the Disney Hollywood hotel. The room area was only about 10 square meters. The bathroom was about 3 square meters.The hotel's service staff attitude is very good. They will ask them to answer them carefully and provide suggestions.The location of this restaurant is very good. It is about 7 minutes walking from the subway station and SOGO. It is about 15 minutes away from Times Square. It is located in a prosperous area and quiet.The door to the left is 230 meters away. It is very convenient to go around everywhere. Each person is 2-4 yuan.We stayed in the city for 2 days and fully enjoyed the superiority of the geographical location.In Hong Kong, we have not taken the subway, because after familiar with the surrounding environment, we feel that it is more convenient to do ground traffic.When we go to Taiping Mountain to see the night view of Hong Kong, we are riding a tram, which is not only convenient and cheap, but also appreciates Hong Kong's street view.On the 19th, he ordered the airport delivery service, 70 per person, which was very worthy.Because it takes 300 to take a taxi to the airport, it takes about 200 yuan to take the subway, and you don't have to run around your own luggage.Large luxury travel cars, wide leather seats, there are only 7 people on the car. It is really cool. It is recommended to use it."
1,"房间很干净,也比较大,周围环境不错,是比较理想的商务酒店",The room is very clean and large. The surrounding environment is good. It is an ideal business hotel
0,这是一个让我比较不满意的酒店。由于订酒店时太晚，没有订上隔壁的“君逸康年大酒店”，本以为天玺与君逸康年一墙之隔，不会太差，结果太令我失望了：1、酒店隔音效果极差，以至于直到半夜2:00还能听到走廊以及隔壁不该听到的声音；2、设备一般，设施基本都比较老化；令我非常恶心的事情是，提供的一次性牙刷非常软，而且最要命的是，牙刷居然掉毛，掉出的牙刷毛粘在舌头上能感受到却找不出来，让我漱口半天才感觉嘴里清爽了；第二天早晨换了另外一个牙刷，效果一样，晕。由于有了这恶心的经历，我才时隔多月仍要上来点评一下该酒店。这酒店对于长沙的住房价格来说，太名不副实了，如果大家非要在这附近住，我强烈建议到隔壁的君逸康年去。,"This is a hotel that makes me more dissatisfied.Because it was too late to book a hotel, I did not book the ""Junyi Kang Nian Hotel"" next door. I thought that Tianxi was separated from the wall of Junyi Kang Nian, and it would not be too bad.The difference is that until 2:00 midnight, you can hear the corridor and the sound of the next door. 2. The equipment is generally aging;And the most terrible thing is that the toothbrush is actually fossil, the fell to the toothbrush hair sticks to the tongue, but I can't find it. It makes me feel refreshing in my mouth for a long time; I changed another toothbrush in the next morning,The effect is the same, dizzy.Due to this disgusting experience, I still came up to review the hotel after many months.This hotel is too famous for Changsha's housing prices. If you have to live near this nearby, I strongly recommend going to the Junyi Kang year next door."
0,酒店位置还不错，附近就有不少饭店。由于是单行道车子只能停在酒店的后门，到前台要走点路，这点不是很方便。酒店的门童如同虚设既不会帮客人开门，更不要说帮客人拿行李了。前台态度也不好，对客人爱理不理的。房间设施一般，网速不仅慢还会经常断网。,"The hotel location is not bad, there are many restaurants nearby.Because it is a single -line car that can only stop at the back door of the hotel, it is not very convenient to go to the front desk.The hotel's door children will not help the guests open the door, let alone help the guests get my luggage.The attitude of the front desk is not good, and the guests ignore it.The room facilities are average, and the internet speed will not only be slowly disconnected."
1,为了等海口到广州的椰香公主号，暂住一晚，才发现携程订房的问题：同宾馆低价位的房间不推荐，怕是回扣不够高。当晚办入住手续时边上有人开房间，前台价格直接能打折到338元，比我携程定的还低40元，一问才知房间倒是一样的，就少一台电脑，比我的房间实惠，携程最便宜的房间要378元，很不爽。,"In order to wait for the princess of the coconut incense from Haikou to Guangzhou, I lived temporarily, and I found that Ctrip's booking problem was discovered: the low -cost rooms in the same hotel are not recommended, I am afraid that the rebate is not high enough.Someone opened the room on the side when check -in that night, and the front desk price could be discounted directly to 338 yuan, which was 40 yuan lower than the Ctrip. I only asked the room was the same.Ctrip's cheapest room costs 378 yuan, which is very upset."
1,这个价格，算性价比很高的一个酒店了。当然价格便宜，就不能太计较服务了。总的来说是一个愿意再次入住的酒店。,"This price is a hotel with a high price -performance ratio.Of course, if the price is cheap, you can't get too much service.Generally speaking, it is a hotel willing to stay again."
0,1.早餐很差。2.服务态度很差。3.地理位置也不好。周围没有什么吃的。综合来说，很差。我是2008年4月28日入住的。,"1. Breakfast is poor.2. The service attitude is poor.3. The geographical location is not good.There is nothing to eat around.In summary, it is very bad.I stayed on April 28, 2008."
1,第一次来东营，第一次入住东胜海天，整体感觉还不错，很气派的大堂，服务和早餐都不错！嗯，值得推荐，下次出差还打算住这里。补充点评2008年5月17日：补充一下，我住的是高级单人间，面积很大还有长长的走廊，有点像套房的感觉，强烈推荐。,"When I came to Dongying for the first time, I stayed at Dongsheng Haitian for the first time. The overall feeling was good. The lobby, the service and breakfast were good!Well, it is worth recommending, and I plan to live here next time.Supplementary comment on May 17, 2008: In addition, I live in a high -end single room with a large area and a long corridor. It feels a bit like a suite, which is strongly recommended."
0,房间较小，配置一般，如家越来越差，如果不在现在基础上加以提高，不出几年就要找不到了，现在只想赚加盟费去了吧？,"The room is small and the configuration is average. If the home is getting worse and worse. If you are not improved on the basis of now, you can't find it in a few years. Now you just want to make a joining fee?"
1,性价比很好，非常好的5星级的酒店。公司协议价还比携程便宜很多。,"Valuable, very good 5 -star hotel.The company's agreement price is much cheaper than Ctrip."
0,房间地毯太脏，临近火车站十分吵闹，还好是双层玻璃。服务一般，酒店门口的TAXI讲是酒店的长期合作关系，每月要交费给酒店。从酒店到机场讲得是打表147元，到了后非要200元，可能被小宰30-40元。,"The carpet in the room is too dirty, and the near -railway station is very noisy. Fortunately, it is double -layer glass.The service is average. The taxi at the entrance of the hotel is a long -term cooperative relationship of the hotel, and the monthly fee is paid to the hotel.From the hotel to the airport, it is a Table of 147 yuan. After arriving, it has to be 200 yuan, which may be 30-40 yuan."
1,我是今年五一的时候去的，感觉还可以，餐厅也不错，服务也很好，受感动最深,"I went when I was in May 1st this year. I feel it is okay. The restaurant is also good, the service is also very good, and I am moved the deepest."
1,总的来说不错。服务也还好。我到的时候是12点，前台的小姐查了半天，才确认我订的房间，办手续又花了不少时间，因为前台就一个人，一边接电话，一边给我办理登记。最大的问题是靠近高架的房间噪音实在太大。虽然我之前看过别人的评论，对此有心理准备，但真的住进去，才发现深更半夜，那个高架上汽车飞驰而过的噪音，不是一般的大！,"Overall is good.The service is okay.When I arrived, it was 12 o'clock. The lady at the front desk checked for a long time before confirming that I booked the room. It took a lot of time to go through the procedures, because the front desk was alone, while answering the phone and registering for me.The biggest problem is that the noise near the elevated room is too big.Although I have seen other people's comments before, I am mentally prepared for this, but I really lived in, and I realized that in the middle of the night, the noise of the car on the elevated car was not ordinary!"
0,55555555，我住过最差的酒店之一，奉劝大家还是跑远一点吧。,"55555555, one of the worst hotels I have lived, I advise everyone to go a little farther."
1,不愧是国宾馆，深宅大院，门口还有站岗的，里面有警卫处，一般人都不敢靠近，就是院子太深了（进楼还得走老远），没有自驾车很不方便。房子不错（虽然仅仅是便宜的7栋），而且还有两瓶免费的矿泉水――是我住的长春三家宾馆中唯一的，就是早餐不咋地――是三家中最差的。,"It is worthy of being a national hotel, the deep house, and there are standing at the door. There is a guard office in it. Most people dare not approach. The yard is too deep (it has to go to the building). It is inconvenient to drive without self -driving.The house is good (although it is just 7 cheap buildings), and there are two bottles of free mineral water -the only one of the three hotels in Changchun I live in is the breakfast -the worst of the three."
1,订的是标A，房间装修比较新。只是洗澡的热水要等个快7-8分钟才热起来。附近很热闹，楼下就是文庙，有些古色古香的闽南建筑，对面就是铜佛寺，在走点路不远就是关帝庙和清真寺。不过离汽车站有些距离，步行要20分钟左右。不过标A的房价只在周末才268（无早餐)，平时要300.只是现在星级的酒店好像都挺吝啬，瓶装水都没要出钱，反而现在商务酒店都会免费送2瓶水。,"The bid A is set, and the room decoration is relatively new.It's just that the hot water in the bath has to wait for 7-8 minutes to get hot.It is very lively nearby. There is a cultural temple downstairs. Some antique southern Fujian buildings are opposite the Tongmo Temple. It is not far from the road and the mosque.However, there is some distance from the bus station, and it takes about 20 minutes to walk.However, the housing price of the standard A is only 268 (no breakfast) on the weekend. It usually takes 300. It seems that the star -rated hotels now seem to be quite embarrassed. Bottle water does not have to pay money. Instead, the business hotel will send 2 bottles of water for free."
1,"设施有点陈旧,位置不错,不过总体还不错.","The facilities are a bit old and the position is good, but the overall is not bad."
1,"1.地香蜜湖站出去後,有任何指指示酒店方向,於初到深圳的旅客而言,可能要花多走冤枉路,建酒店在地出口置明指示牌,引旅客.2.酒店根本有附泳池,前服坦承室外泳池是隔壁<安柏.晶>社的公.入住酒店的客人,是使用施的!3.房可上,但租一每天10元人民,感此星酒店,不收用!4.我入住二房一的房,示是三人房,但早餐何持只附人份?道第三人就不用吃早餐?而以那的自助早餐,一份自要30元人民,我想很少有人意付去吃!5.除了上述能改更好以外,心而,此次入住七天六夜的整感是意的.竟要找到一交通方便,中取,且碗瓢盆一俱全,洗衣乾衣甚至DVD等家居器用品都心安排到位的住,在不易;住在盛庭,真的很有""家""的感!6.酒店人的服度很好,有器故障求修很快安排妥,清工打也很真,些使我及家人定以後若再有到深圳做客,定再次考入住盛庭!!","1.

Washing dry clothes and even DVD and other home appliances are arranged in place, which is not easy; living in Shengting, really feels like ""home""!The instrumental failure was arranged quickly, and the clearance was very real. Some of me and my family would settle in Shenzhen to visit Shenzhen again, and I will be admitted to Shengting again !!"
1,我住的行政房，管理不错，行政楼层有单独的前台很方便，房间偏小，沙发布面脏了旧了。行政楼层早餐独立的，但是东西实在太少，品种少，数量也少。,"The administrative house I live in is good. There is a separate front desk for administrative floors. The room is small, and the room is too dirty.The breakfast of the administrative floor is independent, but there are too few things, there are few varieties, and the number is small."
1,3月12日入住。价格方便，在哈尔宾算比较高的，而且是比较老的酒店，设施比较的旧，隔音的效果不好。前台其实还不错，没有前面的哥们说的那么寒碜。交流下来还是挺愿意服务好客户的。晚上没有骚扰电话。应该说如果你觉得价格合适的话，应该算比较不错的宾馆了。火车站去那边8元的起步费。飞机场的话，做门口的大巴到火车站，只要20元，然后再打车。交通还是比较方便的，步行就是秋林，远大。吃饭的话去远大楼上也不错。,"Check in on March 12.It is convenient for the price. It is relatively old in Halbin and is a relatively old hotel. The facilities are relatively old and the sound insulation is not good.The front desk is actually pretty good, not as cold as the buddies in front.After communicating, it is quite willing to serve customers.No harassment call at night.It should be said that if you think the price is appropriate, it should be considered a good hotel.The railway station goes to the starting fee of 8 yuan over there.At the airport, do the bus at the gate to the train station, only 20 yuan, and then take a taxi.Transportation is still more convenient. Walking is Qiulin, which is far.It is also good to go to the far building if you eat."
1,三星级酒店，烟草公司投资的，但开业早，装修有些旧，房间比较大，但自觉不如如家等舒适。本来也没准备住星级酒店，但查携程未看到商务酒店。实际上我在商业区看到一家晋江之星，不知为什么携程没有。,"Three -star hotel, which is invested by Tobacco Company, but early opened, the decoration is a bit old, the room is relatively large, but it is not as comfortable as home.I was not prepared to stay in a star hotel, but Cha Ctai did not see a business hotel.In fact, I saw a star of Jinjiang in the business district. I don't know why Ctrip did not."
1,酒店的位置非常好、地处闹市房间却很安静，但设施有点旧，被子上面竟然很多洞，服务态度较好，尤其是礼宾人员，服务很热情、很主动，但美中不足的是我预定到28号的房间，27号酒店就通知携程说我退房了，还有28号退房时，忘在酒店的洗面奶竟然查房的没有提醒我。,"The hotel's location is very good, but the room in the downtown is very quiet, but the facilities are a bit old, and there are many holes on the quilt. The service attitude is better, especially the ritual staff.In the room, the 27th hotel notified Ctrip that I was out of the room. When there was a check -up on the 28th, the face washing milk in the hotel did not remind me."
1,很短的时间第二次入住，前台已告知下次再来不用刷预授权了，确实有大酒店的风范和气度。整体感觉很满意。但有两点感觉不大好：1、床下不干净，很多污物，看来平时服务生打扫不是非常彻底2、不知道什么原因，我住了两天，但携程只给了一天的积分。联系携程说是酒店告知携程我提前一天离店。但我联系酒店，酒店反馈没有如此告知携程。虽然最终给我补了积分，但感觉酒店、携程的沟通还是不顺畅,"For the second time in a short time, the front desk has been informed that the next time you do n’t have to authorize the authorization, there is indeed the style and demeanor of the big hotel.The overall feeling is very satisfied.But there are two things that do not feel very good: 1. The bed is not clean, and many dirts. It seems that the usual waiter's cleaning is not very thorough. 2. I don't know why. I lived for two days, but Ctrip only gave one day's points.Contact Ctrip said it was the hotel that I left the store one day in advance.But I contacted the hotel, and the hotel feedback did not inform Ctrip.Although I finally made up my points, I felt that the communication of the hotel and Ctrip was still not smooth."
0,"如要入住住以下,我提最好不要入住,通程有很多.1.要投金苑酒店1.我是定12/26-12/28共二晚金苑酒店.定要求三房在同一.可是有一房在A座($450).另外在($330)在B座.我到前台的工作","If you want to stay below, I will mention that it is best not to stay.There is a room in Block A ($ 450). In addition ($ 330) in Block B. I work to the front desk"
1,"推荐这里的日式大床房,很舒服!千万不要住没有窗户的房间啊,很闷,最好住在五层,三层的空中花园会引来不少虫子.","Recommend a large Japanese -style bed room here, very comfortable! Don't live in a room without windows. It is very stuffy. It is best to live in the five -story. The three -storey sky garden will attract a lot of bugs."
1,非常好的一个酒店。我拿到的是特价房，感觉物超所值。,"A very good hotel.I got a special room, and it felt worthwhile."
1,酒店就在西门长途汽车站对面，因此如果坐长途汽车过去，到西门站下，马路对面就是。大门实际在环城西路，不过指示牌很明显，因此在人民中路也可以看到。豪华标准房，房间挺大，我们住的1813，窗外有个公园。浴室很大，有分开的浴缸和淋浴房。隔音效果一般，空调有点闷热。早餐可以选的不多。人民中路上有一段步行街，基本都是连锁品牌，没有什么特别。有一家比较大的购物商场，楼上有个babyface酒吧，混合disco和nightclub于一体，喜力100元4瓶，有DJ，9点半后有女孩跳舞（还有一个跳钢管舞）不过非常业余，跳一首曲子就下去了。听说有几个公园去散步还不错。,"The hotel is opposite to the West Men's long -distance bus station, so if you take the long -distance car to go to Ximen Station, it will be opposite the road.The gate is actually on the West Road of the city, but the sign is obvious, so it can also be seen on the people's middle road.Luxury standard rooms, the room is quite large, we live in 1813, there is a park outside the window.The bathroom is large, with separate bathtubs and shower rooms.The sound insulation effect is average, and the air conditioner is a bit sultry.There are not many breakfast.There is a walking street on the middle of the People's Middle Road, which is basically a chain brand, and there is nothing special.There is a relatively large shopping mall. There is a Babyface bar upstairs. Mixed Disco and NightClub are one in one., Jump a song and go down.I heard that there are a few parks to take a walk."
0,订的￥230普通间，先说不说房间设施一般，在前台的服务简直无法理解，站在接待处时，服务员将在我后面的3个人先办理（续房），但总有个先来后到吧，不理解。,"The ￥ 230 room is booked. Let ’s say that the room facilities are generally not understood. When the front desk service is not understood. When standing at the reception point, the waiter will handle the three people behind me (renewal), but there is always one first come and then go.Don't understand."
0,房间太旧，卫生间是很多锈迹，房间比较大，大床不错，我喜欢。价格还可以，就是太旧了，不舒服，服务员水平差不多二十年前老国营的水平。下次会换一家住。不过据说小姐不错，俺没试。,"The room is too old, the bathroom is many rust, the room is relatively large, the big bed is good, I like it.The price is okay, but it is too old and uncomfortable. The level of the waiter is almost the same as the old state -owned state.I will change my family next time.But it is said that the lady is good, I didn't try it."
1,入住的是260元的迷你标准间。感觉比想象的要好很多，房间如果住一个人很合适的，洗手间很大，很干净。房间里床上用品质量很不错，整洁如新。房间窗户为玻璃幕墙，无法打开换气。这是距离大连火车站最近的酒店。前台服务态度很好，很热情，业务熟练。就是退房的时候，查房比较慢，人多的时候，要多等几分钟。总体感觉还是可以的，交通极为便利。,"The mini -standard room of 260 yuan stayed.It feels much better than expected. If the room is very suitable, the bathroom is very large and clean.The quality of the bed in the room is very good, neat and new.The room window is a glass curtain wall and cannot be opened.This is the hotel closest to Dalian Railway Station.The front desk service attitude is very good, very enthusiastic, and proficient in business.It is when checking out, the inspection room is relatively slow. When there are many people, wait a few more minutes.Overall feel is okay, and transportation is extremely convenient."
0,我再也不会入住该酒店了，这是我住过的最差的酒店，热水至少要放5分钟才会有，而且宾馆设施陈旧,"I will never stay in the hotel anymore. This is the worst hotel I have lived. It takes at least 5 minutes to be available in hot water, and the hotel facilities are old."
0,不按服务约定提供饮用水，还要狡辩，不愿意改进。国外许多地方都习惯于直接喝饮用水，不因该要求客人喝烧过的自来水。两者不能划等号。补充点评2008年2月5日：这个酒店评为携程4星，我觉得有问题。有些评价不客观，有些评价文一会儿说是替来北京出差的人订的房间，一会儿又谈自己住过的感受，有猫腻。希望携程（听说已在美国上市，有远大志向）不要沦落成为街头拉客的公司。,"Do not provide drinking water according to the service agreement, but also sophistry and unwilling to improve.Many places abroad are accustomed to drinking water directly, and should not drink tap water that have been boiled because of the request.The two cannot be equal.Supplementary comment on February 5, 2008: This hotel is rated as Ctrip 4 stars. I think there is a problem.Some evaluations are not objective. Some evaluations say that they are booked a room for people who come to Beijing for a while. After a while, they talk about the feelings they have lived, and they are greasy.I hope that Ctrip (I heard that it has been listed in the United States, there is a big ambition) not to fall into a company for the streets."
1,大堂宽大豪华，服务有水准，装修一般，因为是十几年以前的建筑（92年邓公南巡后菲籍华侨郑周敏投建，滥尾至近年才投入使用），标间不够宽大，所以两张床要挤在一起。所配Hisense冰霜有嗡嗡声，对我来说有影响。我们家里的冰箱都是制冷的时候才有响声，为什么这台冰箱总在嗡？南侧紧邻西苑公园，早上有早锻炼的音乐，所以有睡懒觉习惯的人别选南侧房间。,"The lobby is large and luxurious, the service is standardized, and the decoration is average. Because it is a building more than a decade ago (92 years after the Deng Gongnan tour, Zheng Zhoumin, an overseas Chinese in the Philippines.Squeeze together.There is a buzzing sound with Hisense's frost, which has an impact on me.The refrigerators in our house are sounded when they are refrigerated. Why is this refrigerator always hum?The south side is close to Xiyuan Park, and there are music that exercise early in the morning, so people with a habit of sleeping are not chosen to the south room."
1,酒店位置交通方便，走不远就有多路公交车；服务很好，我们提前入住，并没有多收费用；吃饭方便，楼下就是避风塘，酒店中餐厅的套餐也不错，味美实惠。购物也很便利，不远的延安路就有采芝斋的专卖店，而往中山酒店走的方向一条小巷子里有菜市场，可以买到蔬菜水果和油条早餐。宾馆反馈2008年8月11日：非常感谢您对我们酒店服务的肯定。酒店会不断的努力，提升酒店品质，提高服务质量。衷心期待您的再次光临！,"The location of the hotel is convenient for transportation, and there are many buses when you go far. The service is very good. We stay in advance without paying more fees. It is convenient to eat. The downstairs is a shelter. The restaurant in the hotel in the hotel is also good and delicious.Shopping is also very convenient. There is a specialty store on Yan'an Road, which is not far away, and there is a vegetable market in a small alley in the direction where the Zhongshan Hotel. You can buy vegetables and fruits and fritters breakfast.Hotel feedback on August 11, 2008: Thank you very much for your affirmation of our hotel service.Hotels will continue to work hard to improve hotel quality and improve service quality.I sincerely look forward to your visit again!"
1,"我觉得这是我在如家服务最好的酒店了..交通方便,就是不好订到房间,要住的朋友最好提前几天订哦","I think this is the best hotel in Rujia .. It is convenient for transportation, but it is not easy to order the room. Friends who live in a few days in advance are made."
1,房间、环境、服务都可以。只是上网不是免费，HK$156/24h!!,"The room, environment, and service are available.It's just that the Internet is not free, HK $ 156/24h !!"
1,酒店的环境很好，是个相当不错的度假村。尤其是9号楼的风景最佳。只是服务存在问题，9号楼无电梯，行李要自己提，游泳池没及时清理，水上漂浮树枝，另外对沿岸的杂草未及时清除。如果在管理上下点功夫，完全可以和开元度假村竞争。,"The hotel's environment is very good, it is a pretty good resort.Especially the scenery of Building 9 is the best.There is just a problem with the service. There is no elevator at Building 9. The luggage must be mentioned by itself. The swimming pool is not cleaned in time. The floating branches on the water are not cleared in time to weeds along the coast.If you work hard on management, you can compete with Kaiyuan Resort."
1,赞。因为这个价格在徐家汇是很划算的咯。对面就是商场。旁边吃饭一条街，天钥桥路。靠近地铁。房间一般了，喜欢里面的沙发。感觉温馨！服务也不错，如果来玩住这里就是很好了。商务出行，就是比较方便！缺点：款待收费。,"Thumbs up.Because this price is very cost -effective in Xujiahui.Opposite the mall.Eating a street next to me, Tian key bridge.Near the subway.The room is average and likes the sofa inside.Feel warm!The service is also good, if you come to play here, it is good.Business travel is more convenient!Disadvantages: Time to charge."
0,房间非常小，一张床＋写字台就满了。对于只需要睡一觉，且想省钱的朋友来说，是合适的。Motel168的房价比它便宜，房间比它大。如家的房间和它差不多，但是房假比它便宜。总之，挺干净，挺省钱的。,"The room is very small, and a bed + writing table is full.It is suitable for friends who only need to sleep and want to save money.Motel168's house prices are cheaper than it, and the room is larger than it.Rujia's room is similar to it, but the room is cheaper than it.In short, it is very clean and save money."
0,看了前面介绍的推荐去入住的，结果很失望，酒店的淋浴居然没有维护设施，洗个澡弄得整个洗手间都淋湿了，小心翼翼的穿上已经湿透的纸拖鞋，还要担心摔倒，另外酒店的隔音设施非常差，走廊里一有人经过，你就别想着能听不见，我注的那个房间的电视还要搞笑，就收不来几个台，好不容易收到的台还全都是雪花，反正以后再也不去住了，唯一值得表扬的是服务员态度还不错,"After reading the recommendations introduced earlier, I was disappointed. The shower of the hotel did not maintain a maintenance facility. The bathing room was wet, and I carefully put on the wet paper slippers.In addition, the sound insulation facilities of the hotel are very poor. As soon as someone passes by the corridor, don't think about it.It's all snowflakes, anyway, I will never live anyway. The only thing worthy of praise is that the waiter's attitude is not bad."
1,"酒店不错,我是大年27入住的,一个叫XX红的前台女孩接待的,感觉很好.当我办理入住是换了一个前台小姐,很""职业""的样子,好象酒店是她家开的.需要我出示携程卡,有点不爽!酒店很幽静,挺大的,尤其适合自驾游的朋友,在清净中寻找一点悠闲的感受,推荐9号楼标准间,480含双早,早上起来一点要去逛一逛旁边的晋祠,当地人还算淳朴,不过不","The hotel is good. I am 27th in the big year. A front desk girl named XX red is received. It feels good. When I handled it, I changed the front desk lady, which was very ""career"".Well. I need to show the Ctrip Card, which is a bit uncomfortable! The hotel is very quiet, very large, especially suitable for friends who travel to self -driving, find a little leisurely feeling in the cleanliness, recommend building No. 9 standard room, 480 with double morning, get up a little morning in the morning, a little bit in the morningTo go to the Jin Temple next to the Jin Temple, the locals are quite simple, but no"
1,"酒店一般来说是尚可但是携程的价格实在是没竞争力,在柜台前问了一下临柜的价格,前台还迟疑了一下说是480多,我想搞不好比携程的低而不好意思说会问价钱的原因是前一位结帐的旅客结帐时只有三百多而已,说是签约价,想细问确认到底是多少钱,当然是没告诉我在此呼吁,我们支持携程的酒店预约服务,而认为不支持携程优惠签约价格的酒店宾馆,携程也没必要在此浪费空间占了网页,让我们没什么好感觉中信是台湾人开的,广东东莞海悦也是,但是海悦的价格就很好,比很多拿海悦贵宾卡的还低价,这个样子就是我所说的支持","Generally speaking, the price of Ctrip is really not competitive. I asked the price of the cabinet in front of the counter. I hesitated at the front desk and said it was more than 480. I think it ’s like Ctrip.The reason for the price is that there were only more than 300 passengers at the previous checkout at the checkout. It was said that it was a contract price.Booking services, and hotel hotels that do not support Ctrip's preferential signing price, Ctrip does not need to waste room here to occupy the webpage here. It makes us feel that CITIC is opened by Taiwanese, and it is also Haiyue, Dongguan, Guangdong, but the price of HaiyueIt's very good, but a lot of low prices than a lot of Haiyue VIP cards. This looks like what I said."
1,服务很热情，价格相对其它喜来登较便宜，下次仍会选择。,"The service is very enthusiastic, the price is relatively cheaper than other Sheraton, and will still choose next time."
0,酒店内有刺鼻的浓味，尤其是过道，不过该酒店在装修。此外，入住前跟酒店确认好的积分累计也事后找借口，说房价太低而不予累计。本人不推荐入住该酒店。,"The hotel has a pungent and thick flavor, especially the aisle, but the hotel is renovating.In addition, the accumulation of accumulated points with the hotel before staying with the hotel also made excuses afterwards, saying that house prices are too low and do not accumulate.I don't recommend staying at the hotel."
1,我们入住的房间是三室一厅住房改造的，有两个大床和一个小床，两个卫生间和自助厨房，房间很大，适合一大家子人。缺点是酒店的位置不太好，既不靠海边，又不靠市中心。,"The room we stayed in was three -bedroom and one -living house reconstruction. There were two large beds and a small bed, two bathrooms and self -service kitchens. The room was large and suitable for a large family.The disadvantage is that the hotel's position is not very good, neither by the seaside nor the center of the city."
1,标准间面积大，但房间陈旧，有些味道。早餐人多时很混乱。,"The standard room area is large, but the room is old and tastes somewhat.Breakfast is very chaotic."
0,我那天用信用卡作了担保，订26号凌晨的大床房，事先说明了入住的时间的。结果，到达酒店的时候，居然才得知，根本没有给我留房间。弄得我一个女子半夜三更还要去找酒店，极不安全。对这样的服务态度和这样差的信誉，实在让我对“如家”的感觉大打折扣！！！！各位订酒店的朋友，要注意啊！,"I used a credit card that day to make a guarantee, and I booked a large bed in the early morning of the 26th to explain the time to stay in advance.As a result, when I arrived at the hotel, I learned that I did not leave the room at all.It made me a woman go to the hotel in the middle of the night, which was extremely unsafe.The attitude towards such a service attitude and such a poor reputation really made me greatly reduced the feeling of ""home""!IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionFriends to book hotels, pay attention!"
1,"离南京西路才一公里,靠近中心商业区,所以价格比一般如家要贵!地点算是好找!周围环境一般,房间内比以前住过的如家要大,但是房间内有比较浓的空气清新剂的味道,所以要开窗开空调换气.整体来说可以接受!特别是在上海房价这么贵的地方.","It is only one kilometer away from Nanjing West Road, and near the central commercial area, so the price is more expensive than home! The location is easy to find! The surrounding environment is general, the room is larger than the home where I lived before, but there is a strong air in the room.The taste of the agent, so it is necessary to turn on the window and air conditioner. It can be accepted as a whole! Especially in the place where house prices in Shanghai are so expensive."
0,"我也是看了点评才选择的,去后和楼上的老兄看法一样,真不知那些说酒店好的人是受人之托还是酒店的托儿.首先任何湖景房间都只可看到一点点湖景(如果那叫湖景的话),第二,房间也就三星稍好的样子,不大,第三,交通非常的不方便.最最奇怪的是我在携程订的湖景标房,来到酒店被告知标房是大床房,我又不是同志,干嘛要大床,何况如我需要的话会和携程提出的.因为我要去开会,所以他们说先给我大床房等有二张床的房间再换.我想想生气,就和携程提出我不住了,谁知酒店说我进了房间,要付一天的房租,哎:你们抢钱啊?我进去不到十分钟,还停电了五分钟哎.更何况全是你们的问题!另外酒店大堂超土,建议住马可波罗或尊爵湖畔酒店公寓(在百度可搜到)补充点评2007年9月24日：~{N@Iz<dC;SP4rI(8I>;~},~{SPM77""~},~{:\6qPD~}.~{2;R*H%~}!~{IO51~}","I also chose it after watching the review.

1,"非常舒服和享受的酒店,房间设施没的说,五星级,隔音很好,早晚都很安静,由于不在闹市区解放碑,价格比较合理,感觉是重庆性价比最高的五星酒店,出酒店往左手走路边就有小吃摊,从早到晚都有吃的(是酒店服务生推荐的,我们去吃了早餐,很市井,很可口),喜欢品尝当地风情的朋友可以去.2天后又住了一晚洲际,感觉不如希尔顿,因为洲际地处步行街,人较多,服务就跟不上,等2个小时房间才收拾出来.所以下次来重庆还会住这里.","The hotel that is very comfortable and enjoyable, does not say that the room facilities do not say, the five -star, the sound insulation is very good, and it is very quiet sooner or later. Because the price is not in the liberation of the urban area, the price is relatively reasonable. It feels like the most cost -effective five -star hotel in Chongqing.There are snack stalls on the side of the road. There are foods from morning to night (it is recommended by the hotel waiter. We went to eat breakfast, very well well, very delicious). Friends who like to taste the local style can go. 2 days later, I live againIn intercontinental, it feels not as good as Hilton, because the intercontinental is located in pedestrian streets. If there are more people, the service will not keep up. It will be cleaned up for 2 hours. So I will live here next time."
0,该酒店严重名不副实，所谓的商务间豪华间就是一般的标准间，套间就是标准间多出一块，设施陈旧，严重上当。,The hotel's serious name is not true. The so -called business room luxury room is a general standard room. The suite is one more piece of standard room. The facilities are old and serious.
1,住的标间，比较干净，餐厅的菜价格和味道都还可以，也比较新鲜。总的来说，性价比高。,"The standard room is relatively clean. The price and taste of the restaurant are okay, and it is relatively fresh.Overall, cost -effective."
1,酒店处于市中心地段，吃饭方便。装修还可以，服务不错，价格合理。,"The hotel is in the center of the city, and it is convenient to eat.The decoration is okay, the service is good, and the price is reasonable."
1,不错的一家酒店，交通方便，房间设计简洁。国庆期间房价贵了但送早餐，我想其实是早餐没生意所以打到房价里，美其名说送其实是硬性搭配消费，还不如减房价来得实惠。,"A good hotel, convenient transportation, simple room design.During the National Day, house prices are expensive but delivered to breakfast. I think it ’s actually that there is no business for breakfast, so it’ s in the house prices. The name of the name is actually a hard match for consumption. It ’s better to reduce house prices."
1,酒店在西街还算是不错了，景观地理位置都比较好，房间较陈旧但干净舒适。下次可以考虑再次入住。,"The hotel is pretty good in West Street. The location of the landscape is better. The room is old, but clean and comfortable.You can consider staying again next time."
1,"已经是第二次入住了,感觉还是相当好的,房间宽敞,明亮,床又大又软又舒服,不过卫生纸的质量好象下降了.下次还住.","It is already the second time to stay, and it feels quite good. The room is spacious, bright, the bed is large, soft and comfortable, but the quality of toilet paper seems to have fallen. I still live next time."
1,每次来盐城都是住的这里，感觉在盐城虽算不上最好的饭店，但还是算不错的饭店了。房间的环境稍显有些破旧，特别是地毯有点脏。但是整体环境及性价比，感觉还是不错的。补充点评2008年3月22日：服务态度也还不错，后来我一朋友凌晨三点过来的，小姐主动提出，如果他12点前退房，只收他半天房钱。,"Every time I came to Yancheng, I lived here. Although it is not the best hotel in Yancheng, it is still a good restaurant.The environment of the room is slightly worn, especially the carpet is a bit dirty.But the overall environment and cost -effectiveness still feel good.Supplementary comment on March 22, 2008: The service attitude is also good. Later, a friend came at three in the morning, and the lady took the initiative to propose that if he check out before 12 o'clock, he only collects his half -day room money."
0,酒店硬件设施较新，但明显的没有被好好照料。我和朋友们分别住的是日式和中式的房间，踏踏米之间有明显的灰尘，卫生间的门以被下掉。因为大门坏了没被修，轻轻的就关不上。中式房间里的灯忽闪忽暗的，卫生间里的问题一样。还有他们竟然没有提供喝水的杯子，只有卫生间内漱口的杯子。走廊内的地毯上有的留下了大块油迹一样的脏处。再好的建筑，一旦这样缺乏维护而被糟蹋和孤弃不管，也维持不了多长时间。另外，服务质量是最大的问题，服务员一问三不知，没有服务和关心消费者意识，对自己工作的环境也是什么问题都答不上。‘这温泉从哪里出来的？“’就在那边‘服务员边答边用手指。我这个游客也知道是估摸温泉池的方向。可是作为酒店员工靠温泉池饭的，连个最简单的温泉知识都没有。’这个温泉里面有些什么矿物质？‘”我不知道“可见这个声称四星级酒店的管理。走的时候问他们，“你们这象我们这样个人游客多吗？””不多，我们大多接受团体，会议，政府的客人“”你们知道为什么没有个人游客吗？“服务员沉默。。。唯一让人感觉稍微好一点的就是热温泉。但是因为没有好的管理，配套服务设施太差也太贵。通过携程定的度假产品付了６１８两人一间房包括两张一次性的温泉票。注意：一次性的意思是虽然不限时，但你只能去一次。也就是说你晚上去了，第二天早上就不能去，哪怕是几分钟。让你感到花了钱，却不开心。酒店没有电梯，楼与楼之间的走廊没有遮风挡雪的玻璃顶，连个篷子都没有，客人泡完温泉只能冷飕飕的跑回房间！他们的整个建筑布局和想法就是模仿日式温泉的，可是这个地方只是照着葫芦画了一个票。什么真的内涵都没有。在日本，你支付一定金额，所有服务项目包括饮食都可以享用，你不用再操心是否需要再支付额外的金额。想来度假的人事先通常都会盘算好度假的预算，东一个消费，西一个消费，让人措手不及，非常毁坏人的心情。试想一个人几个小时又能享用多少个服务项目呢简而言之吧，这不过就是一个不伦不类的，陷阱多多，靠某种机构吃饭而经营不善的温泉澡堂。如长此以往，其时日可能不会太长。,"The hotel's hardware facilities are relatively new, but it is obviously not taken care of.My friends and I lived in Japanese -style and Chinese -style rooms. There were obvious dust between stepping rice, and the door of the bathroom was dropped.Because the door was broken, it was not repaired, and it couldn't be closed gently.The lights in Chinese rooms are dark, and the problems in the bathroom are the same.And they did not provide a cup of drinking water, only cups in the bathroom.Some of the dirty places on the carpet in the corridor were left.No matter how good the building, once such a lack of maintenance, it will not last long.In addition, the quality of service is the biggest problem. The waiter asked three unknown, without service and care of consumer consciousness, and could not answer any questions about the environment of your work.‘Where did this hot spring come from?""'Just over there' the waiter answered with my fingers. I also know that it is the direction of the hot spring pool. But as a hotel employee relying on the hot spring pool rice, there is no simplest hot spring knowledge. 'In this hot spring, in this hot springWhat are the minerals? '""I don't know."" You can see the management of this claiming four -star hotel. When you leave, ask them, ""Do you have more personal tourists like us?"""" Not many, most of us accept groups and meetings, government guests """" Do you know why there are no personal tourists?""The waiter is silent... The only thing that makes people feel a little better is hot hot springs. But because there is no good management, the supporting service facilities are too poor and too expensive.Zhang Dan's hot spring ticket. Note: Although the one -time meaning is that although it is not limited, you can only go once. That is to say, you go at night, and you can't go the next morning, even for a few minutes. Let you feel the flowers.The money is not happy. There is no elevator in the hotel. The corridor between the buildings and the building does not have a glass top of the snow -shocked snow -blocking snow. There is no tent. The guests can only run back to the room after the hot springs are soaked! Their entire building layoutThe idea is to imitate Japanese hot springs, but this place just draws a ticket according to the gourd. There is no true connotation. In Japan, you pay a certain amount, and all service items can be enjoyed.You need to pay an additional amount. Personnel who wants to come on vacation usually calculate the budget of a good vacation. East consumption, a consumption in the west, is caught by surprise, and it is very destroyed.In other words, this is just a nice -oriented hot spring bathhouse that has a lot of traps. It is a hot spring bathhouse that eats a bad operation. If this time, it may not be too long at that time."
1,中规中矩的五星级酒店，但酒店双人房床较小，其他还可以，毕竟也是连锁酒店。另外，酒店的大堂确实有些气势！,"The regular five -star hotel, but the hotel's double room bed is smaller, others are okay, after all, it is also a chain hotel.In addition, the lobby of the hotel is indeed a bit imposing!"
1,由于是帮亲戚预定的酒店。后面得到的反馈是没有在上海的同等酒店好~~~厦门特区的有些酒店是加收政府调节金的。金威也在其内。,Because it is a hotel booked by relatives.The feedback obtained later is not as good as the same hotel in Shanghai ~~~ Some hotels in Xiamen Special Economic Zone are increasing government adjustment.Jinwei is also within it.
1,"房间条件一般般,但位置还不错,离火车站不算远.服务还可以,早餐不错.","The room conditions are average, but the location is not bad. It is not far from the railway station. The service is okay. The breakfast is good."
0,酒店分新楼和旧楼，我订的标准间在旧楼上，不得不说的是房间的设施实在太旧了，地毯已经看不出颜色了，因为住的时间短，所以就没有再换，还好床上用品比较干净。还有前台有一个服务员似乎不会笑，仿佛你来住店给她添了巨大的麻烦一样，我住了2天，每次经过前台都不自觉地看看她，从未见她笑过。真晕！,"The hotel is divided into new buildings and old buildings. The standard room I booked is on the old floor. I have to say that the facilities in the room are too old. The carpet can no longer see the color. Because the time of staying is short, I don’t change it anymore.Fortunately, the bedding is relatively clean.There is also a waiter at the front desk who does not seem to laugh, as if you came to the shop to add huge trouble. I lived for 2 days, and I saw her unconsciously every time I passed the front desk. I never saw her laugh.Really dizzy!"
1,"住了好多次.感觉不错,宽带速度很快,服务态度也可以,价钱也合理.主要问题在于,酒店周围环境不好,日本人实在太多.","I have lived many times. It feels good, the broadband speed is fast, the service attitude is okay, and the price is reasonable. The main problem is that the environment around the hotel is not good, and there are too many Japanese people."
0,现在是2007年7月25日凌晨5点37分，是我住在柳州南天大酒店的第二天，也是连续两个晚上无法入睡。我对这个酒店已经实在忍无可忍，刚刚对他们的服务员发了顿火，可是他们除了说对不起之外，没有任何解决问题的能力。这个酒店根本就不是适合人居住的地方。为什么？因为它的空调系统形同虚设！头一天也就是7月24日，我晚上醒来很多次，都是被活活热醒的！！问他们空调怎么回事，因为整天空调都没有冷风，他们回答总是：我帮你问问，然后就再也没有下文。到了晚上，问题更加严整了。根本就没办法睡觉，热得浑身大汗。强忍着睡也没有用，房间的被子是那种冬天的玩意，又厚，一盖上就包着出汗，没办法了不盖被子吧，房间里面满是蚊子，又便宜了蚊子吸血。就这样一晚上不知道怎么熬过来的。如果不是因为出差位置的原因，我第二天就会走。可是第二天，问题仍然没有解决。再一问，是什么工程部的把空调关掉了。三星级酒店，在炎热夏季的南方，晚上关中央空调！！！我找服务员发火，服务员竟然对我推荐搬台电风扇过来用，这难道是在街边旅社？？！！我已经无法忍受，还三星级，我要质问携程，这难道就是你们的合作伙伴？？你们有没有调查过这个酒店？？我坚决投诉，南天大酒店，连星级都不配！！,"It is now at 5:37 am on July 25, 2007. It is the second day when I live in Nantian Hotel, Liuzhou, and I can't fall asleep for two consecutive nights.I have been unbearable to this hotel. I just sent a fire to their waiters, but they did not have any ability to solve the problem except sorry.This hotel is not a place for people to live.Why?Because its air -conditioning system is shaped!The first day was July 24, and I woke up many times at night, and I was awakened alive!IntersectionAsk them what's going on, because the air conditioner was not cold all day, they always answered: I ask you to ask you, and then there is no more.In the evening, the problem was even more strict.There was no way to sleep at all, sweating so hot.It ’s useless to hold sleep. The quilt of the room is that kind of winter stuff, which is thick. When the cover is covered, it is sweated. There is no way to cover the quilt. The room is full of mosquitoes and cheap mosquitoes.I don't know how to survive it all night.If it wasn't for a business trip, I would leave the next day.But the next day, the problem was still not resolved.Ask again, what engineering department turned off the air conditioner.Three -star hotel, in the hot summer south, the central air conditioner at night!IntersectionIntersectionI found the waiter to get angry, and the waiter even recommended me to use Taipower Fan to come over. Is this on the street hostel?IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionI can't stand it, and I have to question Ctrip.

1,非常不错的酒店，地理位置也不错，性价比很高！,"Very good hotel, the geographical location is also good, the cost performance is high!"
0,酒店比较旧，听说有十几年的历史，房间也比较小。一个所谓三星酒店连一次性的剃须刀都不提供，要另外花15块钱买。总体上还不如火车站周边的商务酒店。,"The hotel is relatively old. I heard that there is a history of more than ten years, and the room is relatively small.A so -called Samsung Hotel does not even provide a one -time shaving knife, and it costs 15 yuan to buy it.Generally speaking, it is not as good as a business hotel around the train station."
1,房间在深圳宾馆来说空间算大。不过细节服务不够。还不如深圳的上海宾馆。补充点评2008年7月21日：床的舒适度还是很满意的。,"The room is in Shenzhen Hotel.But the details are not enough.Not as good as the Shanghai Hotel in Shenzhen.Supplementary comment on July 21, 2008: The comfort of the bed is still very satisfactory."
1,"大堂非常气派,标间的卫生间偏小,所以换了行政间,床有些矮，房间消毒剂的味道较重。不过大堂服务员和餐厅服务员态度都非常好，也很职业。","The lobby is very elegant, and the bathroom in the standard room is small, so the administrative room was changed.However, the lobby waiters and restaurant waiters are very good and very professional."

1,按照我朋友的话说，就是这家酒店有着破烂的外表，却是内里奢华的装修。服务绝对的好，从一下车，到进房间，再到退房，都有非常专业的服务生在接待。帮我拿行李，送到房间，开空调，开灯，泡茶。。。。。。而且坚持不收小费！我住的是特色大房，很好，以后去福州一定还来住这个。很舒服，很宽敞，免费3小时国内长途，电脑免费上网，而且游戏齐全，速度很快。,"According to my friend, this hotel has a tattered appearance, but it is a luxurious decoration in the inside.The service is absolutely good. From the car, to entering the room, to check out, there are very professional waiters to receive.Help me get my luggage, send it to the room, turn on the air conditioner, turn on the light, and make tea.EssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceAnd insist on not collecting tips!I live in a unique house, very good, I will come to live in Fuzhou in the future.Very comfortable, spacious, free 3 hours of free domestic long distance, free computer access on the computer, and the game is complete and fast."
1,令人感觉非常贴心的一点小经历：入住的第二天，MC来了，后来打扫房间的服务员发现后，居然在卫生间多放了一卷纸巾（通常都是很少一点纸巾的，没有一整卷。）虽然一卷纸巾很小很小的事情，却足以体现服务员的细心和体贴。给人感觉非常温暖。呵呵!补充点评2007年11月21日：房间内的保险箱还是比较好用的，感觉非常放心。我想下次去玩的话还会选择入住，就是价格稍微贵了些。呵呵!,"It feels very intimate little experience: the second day of the check -in, MC came, and later the waiter who cleaned the room found that there was a roll of paper towels in the bathroom (usually there were very few paper towels, not a whole whole, none of them were unprecedented.Volume.) Although a roll of paper towels is very small, it is enough to reflect the carefulness and consideration of the waiter.It feels very warm.Haha! Supplementary reviews November 21, 2007: The safe in the room is still relatively easy to use, and it feels very assured.I want to choose to stay next time, that is, the price is slightly more expensive.hehe!"
1,"绿舟宾馆是第二次入住了,重新装修后还是展现出了点星级风范,厚厚的地毯,推窗而见的绿色,空气是很新鲜的,适合度假休息.晚饭在餐厅用的,量少,价格比朱家角贵了.","The Green Boat Hotel is the second time to stay in. After renovation, it still shows a little star, thick carpet, green to the window, the air is very fresh, suitable for vacation and rest.The quantity is small, the price is more expensive than the Zhujiajiao."
1,不错的地方，房间不错，服务也可。除了火车声音有点受不了。,"A good place, the room is good, the service is also acceptable.Except for the train sound, it is a bit unbearable."
0,终于发现酒店没有被淘汰的原因，因为地处中心地段，第三产业相当的发达。,"Finally, it was found that the hotel was not eliminated, because the tertiary industry was quite developed in the center of the center."
0,不知道该酒店如何区分大床与标间？？？床和普通标间的床差不多大小，说是商务房间结果安排在一楼，如何让商务客人安心休息？？,I don't know how the hotel distinguish between large beds and standard rooms?IntersectionIntersectionThe bed and the bed in the ordinary standard room are about the same size. It is said that the results of the business room are arranged on the first floor. How can business guests rest peacefully?Intersection
0,最近变成了四星，好像房间装修过了。餐厅也装修过了。早餐不错。呵呵，继续努力哦,"Recently, it has become four stars, as if the room has been decorated.The restaurant has also been renovated.Breakfast is good.Hehe, keep working hard"
1,给我升级到“韩式房”，进门脱鞋上炕，炕上只有两个大床垫子，感觉有些简陋。卫生间座便带冲洗装置，不错！,"I upgrade to me to a ""Korean room"", and go to the door to take off the shoes. There are only two large mattresses on the cymbal, and it feels a little humble.The bathroom seat has a flushing device, which is good!"
1,总的来说比想象的好，房间比较新，宽带速度还行，交通也方便，去火车站可在门口乘1路11路车。离宁夏有名的小吃国强手抓仅2站路，步行即可，乘1路车去也很方便，打车起步即到。旁边的青青商务酒店楼下有宁夏特产的小超市，感觉商品比较真，我和同事各买了几斤枸杞，挺好的。不足的是进入酒店就能闻到羊膻味，带机顶盒的电视很难操作，隔音不好。,"In general, it is better than imagined. The room is relatively new, the broadband speed is OK, and the transportation is convenient. You can take the 1st road at the door to the train station.Only 2 stops for the famous snack country from Ningxia, just walk, and it is convenient to take a bus.There is a small supermarket under the Qingqing Business Hotel under the Qingqing Business Hotel. I feel that the product is relatively real. I bought a few pounds of wolfberry with my colleagues.The disadvantage is that you can smell the smell of sheep when you enter the hotel. The TV with the set -top box is difficult to operate, and the sound insulation is not good."
1,4星的宾馆总体来说不错。但晚上有点噪音，可能是婚宴或是KTV的声音。电话机的弹簧不太好要接电话老是有问题。,"The 4 -star hotel is generally good.But there is a little noise at night, it may be the sound of a wedding banquet or KTV.The spring of the phone is not very good to answer the phone."
0,"看了前面的点评，感觉此酒店应该不错，所以这次去慈溪定了国脉酒店。结果大失所望。酒店位置不错，298的大床房窗外景色好，公园、小街......不满意的地方：一、房间太脏，地毯肯定二年未洗，污渍满地，如果像走道一样铺大理石反而干净得多；椅背、床背都不干净，房间居然还有一个大苍蝇；二、洗澡的花洒非常不好用，三、大堂的灯太昏暗，头晕！四、前台的服务小姐态度比较生硬；五、酒店所有的商务单人大床靠北边.但是低下是冷却塔,厨房烟道.比较嘈","After watching the previous reviews, I felt that this hotel should be good, so this time I went to Cixi to set the National Mai Hotel.As a result, it was disappointed.The location of the hotel is good, the 298 large bed windows have good scenery, parks, streets ... Disconign places: 1. The room is too dirty, the carpet must not be washed for two years, and the stains are full.The marble is much cleaner; the back of the chair and the bed are not clean, and there is a big fly in the room. Second, the shower in the bath is very difficult to use.Fourth, the service lady at the front desk is relatively stiff; 5. All business single beds in the hotel are on the north. But low is a cooling tower, kitchen flue."
1,主要是离新国际展览中心近，其他没什么优势。,"It is mainly close to the New International Exhibition Center, and there is no advantage."
1,套间没什么意思。是奔着大沙发去的，但没有别的都还可以,"The suite is not interesting.I went to the big sofa, but nothing else is okay"
0,"说实话,环境很不好,在老火车站旁边,虽然新的火车站启用了,不会吵闹了,可是我不明白为什么装修还没到位,根本比不上大城市的3星级酒店,而且通过携程定的房间真的不怎么地,我再次通过携程定了厦门的酒店,如果真的像大多数网友说的,携程定房虽然便宜点,可房间是酒店有差级的话,绝对不相信携程了!!!补充点评2008年2月19日：","To be honest, the environment is very bad. Next to the old railway station, although the new railway station is opened, it will not be noisy, but I don’t understand why the decoration has not yet been in place, it is not as good as a 3 -star hotel in a big city.Through the Ctrip's fixed room, I really set the hotel in Xiamen again through Ctrip.

1,住了三个晚上，总体感觉还是蛮不错的。最满意的是酒店提供的免费升标。预定的是商务标间，由于客满，酒店给我们免费升到了高级商务标间。在这里赞一个。要说不足之处，一个是前面有网友提到的隔音效果不太好。另一个是没热空调，开了一晚还是冷风。后来向宾馆打听了下，好像是说没有热空调的。,"After three nights, I still feel pretty good.The most satisfied is the free raising provided by the hotel.The booked business standard room. Due to the fullness, the hotel gave us free to the high -end business standard room.Praise one here.To say that the disadvantage is that the sound insulation effect mentioned by netizens in front is not good.The other is no hot air conditioner, and it is still cold after one night.Later, I asked the hotel, as if there was no hot air conditioner."

0,虽然说是4星级，不过除了大厅感觉够气派以外，其余仅仅只能说一般~~房间里面居然有好多黑色的硬壳小虫，让我们觉得很是恶心阿...当然也有可能因为我们住的是3号楼，是不是有点成旧的关系？早餐虽然是免费的，但是看到票价也要20呢，菜品实在是.....不过门口那部劳斯莱斯幻影倒是的确让人震撼！看得出，老板还是很有实力的！,"Although it is a 4 -star class, except for the lobby feelings, the rest can only be said to be general ~~ There are a lot of black hard shell worms in the room, which makes us feel very disgusting ...

As in October last year, there are hotels like Rujia, Ctrip still don’t cooperate ...Arrive at the hotel (the alley is very difficult to find, in a dilapidated alley), it is said that there is no room, and it will not be allowed until 6 o'clock. Later, I learned that they rented out the room as a clock in order to make a profit.As a result, the guests delayed their check -out, so we had to wait, and at the beginning, we refused to say that we asked many times, and they were impatient, so they told us the truth ... and obviously felt that the guests they brought to the dealerIt doesn't matter at all, and I don't care about the service attitude.

0,这个饭店真的很一般，感觉不太好。服务人员态度也不是很好，房间的水龙头出来的水开始相当长时间也是黄黄的。下次不会再去了,"This restaurant is really average, it feels not good.The attitude of the service staff is not very good. The water from the faucet in the room began to be yellow for a long time.I won't go again next time"

1,酒店的地理位置不错，就在南京西路口，离地铁很近。晚上还可以逛一下中信泰富和恒隆广场的名牌店。房价也算实惠，硬件及服务都挺好。行政楼层的宽带设施是全免费的，还有健身房也很漂亮。房间比较舒适，可以看看外面的风景，景色确实不错！早餐是中西自助餐，品种也很丰富，餐费含在房费内，蛮划算的！下次出差还会选择这个酒店。,"The hotel's geographical location is good, just at the entrance of Nanjing West, close to the subway.In the evening, you can also visit the famous shops of CITIC Taifu and Hang Lung Square.House prices are also affordable, and hardware and services are very good.The broadband facilities on the administrative floor are free, and the gym is also very beautiful.The room is more comfortable. You can look at the scenery outside. The scenery is really good!Breakfast is a Chinese and Western buffet, and the variety is also very rich. The meal fee is contained in the house fee, which is quite cost -effective!The next time you will choose this hotel."
1,特别喜欢游泳池和健身的地方，交通方便离琶洲展馆比较近，离天河城也近，早餐挺不错的，但他们酒店的其他东西我没有吃过，就不做评论了，总体感觉还是满意的，下次出差还会去住。,"I especially like the place where the swimming pool and fitness. The traffic is convenient to be close to the Pazhou exhibition hall, and it is closer to Tianhe City. The breakfast is pretty good, but I haven't eaten other things in their hotel, so I don’t comment., I will live in the next business trip."
1,价格适中，总体感觉还可以。地理位置上稍微难找一点（因为不是靠大路边），但离商业街北京路很近，酒店门外就有一条小食街。,"The price is moderate, and the overall feeling is OK.It is a bit difficult to find a little in geographical location (because it is not on the side of the road), but it is very close to Beijing Road in Beijing. There is a snack street outside the hotel door."
1,"性价比很高的一家~也是我目前最满意的一家.门口就有便利,水果店,离久光百货5分钟步行,离2号线静安寺5分钟步行.酒店服务很到位!表扬~房间叫餐好方便,味道足,量足,价格平民~以后我会一直选择这里的.呵呵,大家记得早点预定哦!","The cost -effective one is also the one I am most satisfied with. There is convenience at the door. Fruit shops, 5 -minute walk for a long time, 5 minutes away from Line 2 Jing'an Temple. The hotel service is in place! Correction ~ The room is good for meals for meals.Convenient, sufficient taste, sufficient amount, price civilians ~ I will always choose here. Hehe, everyone remember to book earlier!"
0,房间在这个价位来说可以接受，卫生间很大！但是隔音非常差，什么都听得到。最差的是早餐，简直是恐怖，所有的餐具都是塑料的，白色的塑料餐具因为用的时间长了并且长期没有洗净，已经发黑。部分塑料的餐具附着一些不知名的未洗净物，水淋淋的（甚至还有水在碗里），都不知道有没有洗过还是在水里泡一下就拿出来，用来吃粥的小菜上空苍蝇飞舞，包子馒头冰冷。脏，脏，太脏了！我可以要求早餐非常简单甚至就是白粥加水，但是绝对不能容忍脏。这个价钱说含早，但是可以当作不含早来看，反正我没敢吃。宾馆反馈2008年5月21日：非常感谢您对我酒店提出的宝贵意见，针对此种情况，我司会提出整改方案，我们的宗旨是让宾客满意，我们也会为此继续努力，谢谢您！希望下次入住给您不一样的感觉！！,"The room is acceptable at this price, and the bathroom is very large!But the sound insulation is very poor and can hear everything.The worst is breakfast. It is terrible. All tableware is plastic. The white plastic tableware has been black because it takes a long time and has not been washed for a long time.Some plastic tableware attach some unknown unknown unwalaves, and the water (even the water in the bowl). I don’t know if I have been washed or soaked in the water.The flies flying over the sky, and the buns were cold.Dirty, dirty, too dirty!I can ask for breakfast very simple or even white porridge and water, but it must not tolerate dirty.The price is to be early, but it can be used as an early view of it. I didn't dare to eat anyway.Hotel feedback on May 21, 2008: Thank you very much for your precious opinions on our hotel. In response to this situation, our company will put forward a rectification plan. Our purpose is to satisfy the guests. We will continue to work for this. Thank you!I hope I will give you a different feeling next time!Intersection"
0,除了卫生间还算干净，其他都很脏，地毯、毛巾都不干净。午餐在酒店餐厅用餐，亲眼看到服务员将游客吃剩的饭倒回到饭桶中，再剩给别的客人用。建议自驾游的客人不要住在溪口，溪口安排一天足够了，交通很方便，可以住到附近较大的城市去。溪口的吃、喝、玩、睡都很贵，不实惠。,"Except for the bathroom, everything is dirty, and the carpets and towels are not clean.Dinner at the hotel and restaurant, I saw the waiter pour the leftovers to the rice bucket, and leftove it for other guests.It is recommended that the guests who travel travel not to live in Xikou. Xikou arrangements are enough for a day. The transportation is very convenient and can live in a larger city nearby.The food, drinking, playing, and sleeping in Xikou are very expensive and unbearable."
1,酒店很赋予时尚气息，前台小姐热情活泼。也要感谢漂亮的宾客经理秦小姐的热情的服务。总之，整个酒店感觉很温馨，来木棉花是明智的选择！宾馆反馈2008年8月12日：非常感谢您对我们工作的支持和认可，同时也代为转达秦小姐的谢意，期待您的下次光临！！,"The hotel is very fashionable, and the lady at the front desk is enthusiastic and lively.Thanks to the enthusiastic service of Miss Qin, the beautiful guest manager.In short, the entire hotel feels very warm, and it is a wise choice to come to kaptait!Hotel feedback on August 12, 2008: Thank you very much for your support and recognition of our work. At the same time, it also conveyed Ms. Qin's gratitude on his behalf. Looking forward to your next visit!Intersection"
1,确实不错，应该说是超值，实在想不到，在一个县级城市，有这样的酒店。,"It is really good. It should be said that it is value -for -money. I really can't think of. In a county -level city, there are such hotels."
1,酒店的服务非常好，对待客人像对待家人一样。我是12月23日到27日在酒店住了4个晚上，可以说每晚都有事情发生（先声明事情都是我引起的不是酒店），但酒店每件事都处理的很好，让我觉的很温暖。23日入住时，行李员引导我进房间，并主动帮我检查所有的设施是否正常，结果发现床头灯不亮，于是立即找来房间服务员帮我检查修理，2分钟后一切正常了。要是别的酒店行李员，肯定会放下行李就走了。24日晚，我想泡功夫茶，结果发现有个茶杯不太干净，有点生气，所以就写了个字条留给房间服务生，可是第二天，也就是25日晚上回来，发现茶几上有一个果盘和一封道歉信，是房悟经理亲笔写的，很诚恳，让我也很感动。当即我就决定再泡一次功夫茶。可不巧，25日这晚当我要泡茶时我把茶碗盖打破了，闽南人泡茶不是用茶壶而是我们泡八宝茶的那种茶碗，没有盖茶又泡不成了，遗憾之余还觉得有点愧疚。所以我又留了张字条给房间服务员，表示我会赔偿。但第二天晚上我回到房间，又发现了一封信，酒店表示让我免赔，还非常贴心的问我是否划伤了手，并放了两片创可贴在信封里，当时的我，眼泪一下就出来了，只有妈妈会做的事，想不到在远离家乡的厦门也有人为我做。除此以外，酒店还送了圣诞礼物和贺卡，如果有人打电话到房间我没在房间不能接，酒店也会留下字条告知来电话的人的姓氏和联系方式，我觉得真的很到位，很贴心。这是我住的服务最好的酒店，比5星级的酒店还好，因为他们是出于真心的，而非程式化的服务。下次肯定还去住。,"The service of the hotel is very good, treating guests like a family.I lived in the hotel for 4 nights in the hotel from December 23rd to 27th. It can be said that something happened every night.I feel very warm.When staying on the 23rd, the luggage guided me to enter the room and took the initiative to help me check whether all the facilities were normal. As a result, the bedside lamp was not bright, so I immediately asked the room waiter to help me check the repair. After 2 minutes, everything was normal.If other hotel luggles, they will definitely leave their luggage.On the evening of the 24th, I wanted to make Kung Fu tea, but I found that a tea cup was not very clean and a little angry, so I wrote a note to the room waiter, but the next day, that is, I came back on the evening of the 25th.The fruit plate and an apology letter wrote by Manager Fang Wu, very sincere, and moved me very much.Immediately, I decided to make Kung Fu tea again.Unfortunately, when I was about to make tea on the night of the 25th, I broke the tea bowl lid. The southern Fujian people made tea with a teapot but the kind of tea bowl of baobao tea.I still feel a little guilty.So I left a note to the room waiter again, saying that I would compensate.But the next night I returned to the room and found another letter. The hotel said that I was free of compensation. I also asked me very intimately whether I scratched my hand and put two wins in the envelope. At that time, IThe tears came out. Only what my mother would do. I didn't expect that there were people who did it for me in Xiamen, who was far away from my hometown.In addition, the hotel also gave Christmas gifts and greeting cards. If someone called the room, I did not answer in the room, and the hotel would leave a note to inform the surname and contact information of the people. I think it is really in place.Very intimate.This is the best hotel I live in. It is better than 5 -star hotels because they are sincere, not as procedures.I will definitely live next time."
0,酒店比较偏了，虽然是在东方路上，周围也没什么餐馆可以吃饭的,"The hotel is relatively biased, although there are no restaurants to eat on the Oriental Road, there are no restaurants around."
0,有生以来入住过的最恐怖的酒店之一，可以跟印尼雅加达郊外的酒店媲美（笑）！1。房间里霉味，烟味扑鼻，没有窗户通风，肮脏的地毯上的斑斑点点的污迹，令人触目惊心。2。厕所肮脏，长年累积的污斑，臭味，令人无法如厕。3。楼道里昏暗昏暗的，晚上回房间，请务必几个人同行。4。还算有优点，就是服务员的态度不错。总之，倒贴我1000元也不肯再入住了。,"One of the most horrible hotels that have been staying in in my life is comparable to hotels outside the outskirts of Jakarta, Indonesia (laughs)!1.The smell of mildew in the room, the smoke flavor, no windows ventilation, and the stains of the spots on the dirty carpet are shocking.2.The toilet is dirty, and the stains accumulated for many years are unable to go to the toilet.3.The corridor is dim, and when you go back to the room at night, please go with a few people.4.There is a good advantage, that is, the waiter's attitude is good.In short, I refused to stay at 1,000 yuan."
0,通过携程订的所谓豪华房，设施陈旧，房间还一股臭味，根本不值320元！办入住在A座，住宿却在B座，前台也不告知，害得我拖着行李跑来跑去，不知道酒店对前台员工是怎样进行培训的！晚上骚扰电话不断。早餐更糟，全部品种加起来大约10种。唯一可以的是客房服务员的态度。总之，性价比太差！,"Through the so -called luxury houses ordered by Ctrip, the facilities are old, and the room still has a smell, which is not worth 320 yuan!I live in Block A, but the accommodation is in Block B, and I do n’t tell the front desk. It hurts me to drag my luggage and run around. I do n’t know how the hotel has trained the front desk employees!Night harassment calls are constantly.Breakfast is worse, all of which add up to about 10 species.The only thing can be the attitude of the guest room waiter.In short, the price / performance ratio is too bad!"
1,我是九月份入住的，600多一晚，定的是普通标准简但前台主动免费升级到了15楼的海景房，态度好风景好。其实住在西环挺好的，电车和巴士方便便宜，上次我也住在附近的Ramada感觉挺好。缺点是房间有点旧、壁纸感觉不太干净。,"I stayed in September, more than 600 a night, and set a simple standard for ordinary standards, but the front desk was upgraded to the sea view room on the 15th floor for free. The attitude was good.In fact, it is good to live in the West Ring, and the tram and buses are convenient and cheap. Last time, I also felt good at Ramada nearby.The disadvantage is that the room is a bit old and the wallpaper feels not very clean."
1,还算不错。要说是4星，设施还差点。不过，泰安酒店普遍不好，这个也算凑合了。,"not bad.To say that it is 4 stars, the facilities are almost.However, the Tai'an Hotel is generally not good, and this is also considered."
1,客房、前台服务还可以，就是收银方面存在问题，我有一点电话费，同她说半天，还是这样开不能那样不能，最后全部以房费名义开，给她自己方便，不给我方便。另外早上8点多走廊上吸尘气开始叫了，吵闹得很，想晚点醒好难。有时还要受服务员敲门打扫卫生困扰，这不该是一家四星酒店应该有的服务吧。总体可以，下次去可能会选。,"The rooms and front desk services are okay, that is, there are problems in the cash register. I have a telephone fee. I said with her for a long time, I still ca n’t do that. In the end, all the house fees are opened to give myself convenience and do n’t give me convenience.In addition, the vacuum gas in the corridor at 8 o'clock in the morning began to scream. It was very noisy. It was difficult to wake up late.Sometimes the waiter knocks on the door to clean up the sanitation. This should not be a service that a four -star hotel should have.Overall, you may choose next time."
1,"非常好,每次来北京都会住那里,价钱好,地理位置好,一切都不错~!!!","Very good, every time you come to Beijing, you will live there. The price is good, the geographical location is good, everything is good ~ !!!"
1,"非常好的酒店,服务也很好.我住的是行政豪华房,里面干净宽敞舒服,对面可以看到锦绣中华的全景,晚上还可以看到那里的烟花,好漂亮.还可以延长到下午的4:30之前退房.下次还会选择住这家酒店.","Very good hotel, the service is also very good. I live in the administrative luxury room, which is clean and spacious. On the other hand, you can see the splendid Chinese panorama. You can also see the fireworks there at night. It can be extended to the afternoon.4:30 check out before. I will choose to stay in this hotel next time."
1,首先非常不好找，我们在那个立交桥附近转了四、五圈，打了N个电话才终于到达了。房间是不错，空间很大，设施也比较新。可能是刚开业没多久得缘故吧。开始服务员的服务水平并不是特别高，搞checkin就等了20分钟。还有房间浴室全部是木质的，给人一种焕然一新的感觉。但是挂毛巾和衣服的设施太少了。餐厅的服务员的服务态度和精神可嘉。赞！,"First of all, it was very difficult to find. We made four or five laps near the overpass.The room is good, the space is large, and the facilities are relatively new.It may be because it has just opened.The service level of the waiter was not particularly high, and checkin waited for 20 minutes.There are also wooden rooms in the room bathroom, giving people a new feeling.But there are too few facilities for hanging towels and clothes.The service attitude and spirit of the waiter of the restaurant.Thumbs up!"
1,这是我住的最舒服的酒店了，享受了比较奢侈的从酒店走到国贸10分钟左右，在北京最奢侈的行动方式。哈哈，第一天上班时间想打车去建外，居然等了30分钟才找到出租车，上班的时候打车象是抢东西似的，北京的交通太可怕了。相对这个价位来说，这家酒店超值。周围有2个公交车站。我本来定的是标间，但是房间比较满就给我安排了单人间。房间还不错，虽然没有如家布置的温馨（整体感觉更适合男生住），但是房间可以的，上网的速度比较快。早点也不错。相对于同事住的400多的酒店，我的房间更舒服些。就在双井的过街天桥下面，周围饭店也不少，但是要往国贸方向走。下次去北京，还住着里。呵呵，我们班车站下车就到了,"This is the most comfortable hotel I live in. I enjoyed the more luxurious 10 minutes from the hotel to Guomao, and the most luxurious way of action in Beijing.Haha, I wanted to take a taxi to build on the first day of work, and I waited for 30 minutes to find a taxi. When I was at work, it was like grabbing the west. Beijing's transportation was too terrible.Relative to this price, this hotel is value for value.There are two bus stations around.I originally set a standard room, but the room was full and arranged me a single room.The room is not bad. Although it is not as warm as home (the overall feeling is more suitable for boys), the room is okay, and the Internet speed is faster.Early good.Compared to more than 400 hotels where colleagues live, my room is more comfortable.Below the street bridge of Shuangjing, there are a lot of restaurants around, but they have to go in the direction of China Trade.Next time I go to Beijing and live in.Haha, get off at our class station"
0,叫酒店早上6点50叫醒，但是在7点10还没有人叫，差点误了飞机！,"Call the hotel to wake up at 6:50 in the morning, but no one calls at 7:10, and almost misunderstood the plane!"
0,对于第一次去太原的人，宾馆不好找。出租车都不知道。房间里面有霉味，毛巾的确很差，典型的国有企业。以前对网上的点评持有怀疑态度。现在我知道，我错了。我也要说出我遇见的。另外：携程为什么不和锦江之星或如家一类的酒店签定合作协议呢？有钱大家赚！合作相信是未来社会成功的硬道理。,"For those who go to Taiyuan for the first time, the hotel is not easy to find.I don't know the taxi.The room has a moldy flavor, the towel is indeed poor, and a typical state -owned enterprise.I used to have doubts about the online reviews.Now I know, I am wrong.I also want to say what I met.In addition: Why doesn't Ctrip signs a cooperation agreement with the star of Jinjiang or a hotel like a family?Everyone earns money!Cooperation is believed to be the hardship of the success of the future society."
0,酒店外表及大堂看上去挺好的，本来对它也挺有信心的，而且就在市中心，出行挺方便的，可是从进电梯开始就比较恶梦了，那电梯一点都不像是酒店的电梯，而且从电梯到房间都是一股浓浓的很难闻的味道，很恶心，我订的是标间，设施陈旧又简陋，实在不敢恭维，还说是三星，我觉得它只比招待所好一点点而且，248的收费简直是太过分了,"The appearance of the hotel and the lobby looks very good. It was also very confident in it, and in the city center, it was convenient to travel, but it was more dreamy from the beginning of the elevator.The elevator, and from the elevator to the room, is a strong and unpleasant taste. It is disgusting. I booked a standard room. The facilities are old and humble.The guest house is a little bit better, and the charging of 248 is simply too much"
1,就在崇圣寺后面，酒店环境不错，但硬件设施比较陈旧。地理位置离景点近，但离市区较远，希望酒店能多为客人提供交通上的便利，比如多发班车之类的。,"Behind Chongsheng Temple, the hotel environment is good, but the hardware facilities are relatively old.The geographical location is close to the attractions, but it is far from the urban area. I hope that the hotel can provide more convenient transportation for guests, such as more bus."
1,酒店经过评5星的努力，各方面都有提升，就是携程的价格太高，比朋友帮助预定的高出30%以上，所以，近期住了很久，都是朋友帮助订的房间。价格很低。有需要的朋友可以联系我。,"After 5 stars, the hotel has improved in all aspects, that is, the price of Ctrip is too high, and it is more than 30%higher than the friend's help. Therefore, it has been living for a long time in the near future.T.Friends in need can contact me."
1,"房间设施\装修都不错,环境优雅,接待\结帐服务不错,够星.","The room facilities \ are good decoration, the environment is elegant, the reception \ checkout service is good, enough star."
1,隔香格里拉很近，很方便，不过我门一般是去香格里拉，那次没房了才去的，感觉好算可以,"The fragrance is very close, very convenient, but my door usually goes to Shangri -La. I did n’t have a house that time. It feels good."
1,"订了一个房间,住了三天,档次一般,但性价比还算值得.","I booked a room, lived for three days, and the grade was average, but the cost -effectiveness is worth it."
1,很不错的一家酒店！房间、卫生间、还有床都少见的大，很喜欢，下次到上海还回选这家！,"A very good hotel!The rooms, bathrooms, and beds are rare. I like it very much. Next time I go to Shanghai, I will return to this house!"
0,5。1。---5。3。入住一直没敢在房间洗澡。太冷。房间太陈旧。设施太差。房间里提供桶装水还单收费,5.1.--- 5.3.I never dared to take a bath in the room.Too cold.The room is too old.The facilities are too poor.The room is provided in the room and also charged alone
1,"服务员素质很高,比国内很多5星饭店要好!设施有些旧,但维护的不错,干净!餐饮价格适中!某天晚上工人磨地板,很吵,后交涉停止施工,第2天大堂道歉并送果盘1份,结帐时再次于前台表示歉意,对于他们的服务态度确实没的说,就1个字:好!楼层的小点心很温馨!早餐有山东特色,非常好!说个缺点:房间隔音稍微差一点!补充点评2008年7月22日：靠栈桥近,外部景色优美,值得入住!","The quality of the waiter is very high, which is better than many 5 -star restaurants in China! The facilities are a bit old, but the maintenance is good, clean! The price of catering is moderate! One night, the workers grind the floor, very noisy, then the construction is suspended, the second day of the lobby apologize and send it to the sendingA fruit plate, apologizing again on the front desk at the checkout. It does not say about their service attitude, just 1 word: Okay! The small snacks on the floor are very warm! Breakfast has Shandong characteristics, very good! Say a disadvantage: roomThe sound insulation is slightly worse! Supplementary comment July 22, 2008: Relying on the trestle bridge, the external scenery is beautiful, it is worth checking in!"
0,里面的装修太旧了，洗手间和浴室觉得不太干净，我住的房间所有的水龙头都不太好使，晚上的电话多，服务也比较一般,"The decoration inside is too old. The bathroom and bathroom feels not clean. All the faucets in the room I live in are not very good. There are many phone calls at night, and the service is relatively average."
1,订了套餐，酒店花园风格大气，感觉不错，我想春天应该会更美吧！晚餐用了地方风味套餐很“土”，也很入味；60元抵用券在商场买了些粽子；客房挺安静的，睡得很好；早上7：30就去用早餐了，品种够多（早起的鸟儿有虫吃啊~~嘿嘿~）。恩，总体感觉不错，我挺喜欢的，有机会还会去滴~~,"After ordering the package, the hotel garden style is atmospheric and feels good. I think spring should be more beautiful!The local flavor package for dinner is very ""soil"" and it is also very delicious; 60 yuan has bought some dumplings in the mall; the guest room is quite quiet and sleeps well; I go to breakfast at 7:30 in the morning.(Birds that get up early have worms to eat ~~ Hey ~).Well, it feels good in general, I like it very much, I will get dripping if I have a chance ~~"
1,"优点:1.房间装修真的不错,属于常见的经济型酒店.(最大的优点)2.早餐也很丰富(每天有换品种)...只是服务员打扫的时候,是把桌子上的脏东西,例如面包削往地上扔,让后来用餐的人就感觉不爽了.3.价格也不错,255元/晚(包括早餐和上网)缺点:1.服务一般,部分人员好,部分人员差.(全国跑下来,总的感觉,服务还是越南方越有系统,整体的感觉)","Advantages: 1. The decoration of the room is really good, it is a common economy hotel. (The biggest advantage) 2. Breakfast is also rich (changing varieties every day) ... Just when the waiter is cleaned, it is the dirty things on the table when cleaningFor example, if the bread is cut to the ground, it makes people who dine later feel uncomfortable .3. The price is also good, 255 yuan/night (including breakfast and Internet access) disadvantages: 1. The service is general, some personnel are good, and some personnel are poor. (After running nationwide, the general feeling, the more systematic service is in Vietnam, the overall feeling)"
1,"如果订的是豪华房就会非常不错,空间非常宽敞,而且临街的房子采光很好,感觉很不错.网速似乎有些慢,热水也有些凉.总体还是不错的!","If you order a luxurious room, it will be very good, the space is very spacious, and the house on the street is very good. It feels very good. The network speed seems a bit slow, and the hot water is a bit cold. The overall is still good!"
0,酒店房间真不怎么样，但位置不错。如果有出行计划，一定要提前至少半小时结帐，前台结帐的速度真不敢恭维――我做了笔预授权完成竟然花了一个小时，只见收银员交头接耳嘀咕，好像是不怎么会用POS。,"The hotel room is really not good, but the location is good.If you have a travel plan, you must check out at least half an hour in advance. The speed of checkout at the front desk is really not complimented -I made an hour after I made a pre -authorization and finished.Use POS."
1,"目前景德镇最好的酒店,这次住的是358元的商务标间,房间和卫生间都比较宽敞,干净.但是国外的卫星电视节目只有NHK和CNN.两部小电梯在客人集中的时段要等很久.早餐的确很差.","At present, the best hotel in Jingdezhen lives at a business standard of 358 yuan this time. The rooms and bathrooms are relatively spacious and clean. But foreign satellite TV programs only have NHK and CNN.It takes a long time. Breakfast is really bad."
0,住这里很多次了。但是感觉酒店的服务质量在下降，价格反而是不断上升。我住的房间的楼下正在装修，味道很大，打电话给前台，前台居然说没有房间，要我忍耐一下。找了前台经理理论才解决的。,"I have lived here many times.But it feels that the service quality of the hotel is declining, and the price is continuously rising.The room I lived downstairs was renovating. The taste was very large. I called the front desk. The front desk actually said that there was no room. I asked me to endure it.It was solved by finding the theory of the front desk manager."
0,我个人对这个酒店感觉不好：1、硬件（1）这个所谓的酒店公寓好像有的层是客房有的是居民，我甚至看到有个人在电梯里牵了条大白狗！酒店无论院外还是楼门边都没有“海悦滨江酒店”之类的牌子，只能顺着门牌找，感觉非常不专业。（2）房间临街，早上实在太吵了，不用叫醒或闹钟，五点多准醒。（3）浴室有一道玻璃砖墙临街，非常冷。（4）早餐只有四种可选，量少，单点要40元/份！2、软件（1）工作人员素质实在太差，到了前台里面坐三个人，根本没人理我，直到我说有预定房间要住店。结帐非常慢，等了很多人，发票两天开成一天，一切都很不专业。,"I personally feel bad about this hotel: 1. Hardware (1) The so -called hotel apartment seems to have some layers in the guest rooms and residents. I even saw someone holding a big white dog in the elevator!There is no brand such as the ""Hayue Binjiang Hotel"" by the hotel or the door of the building. It can only be found along the house. It feels very unprofessional.(2) The room is near the street. It is too noisy in the morning. No need to wake up or alarm clock, and wake up at five o'clock.(3) There is a glass brick wall in the bathroom to come to the streets, which is very cold.(4) There are only four options for breakfast, with a small amount, a single point of 40 yuan/serving!2. Software (1) The quality of the staff is too poor. I took three people in the front desk. No one cares about me until I say that there is a scheduled room to live in a shop.The checkout is very slow. After waiting for many people, the invoice is opened for two days, everything is very unprofessional."
1,房间不算太小，床不错，虽然不太软但也挺舒服，干净。最大的问题是上网太贵，HKD70/HOUR，抢钱似的，为什么香港的酒店都没有免费上网呢？,"The room is not too small, the bed is good, although it is not very soft, it is very comfortable and clean.The biggest problem is that the Internet is too expensive, HKD70/HOUR, grabbing money, why is there no free Internet access in Hong Kong?"
1,和网上看到的点评是一样好！虽然到大同的时候，天气很冷，但是到了酒店会觉得很温暖！房间的环境很好，服务员也很到位。意外的是，房间里放了一张欢迎我们的信，这是以前所有宾馆没有遇到的！以后有机会再去，一定还会选择这家宾馆！,"It is as good as the reviews I saw on the Internet!Although the weather is cold when it comes to Datong, it will feel warm when you arrive at the hotel!The environment in the room is very good, and the waiter is in place.Surprisingly, there was a letter that welcomed us in the room, which was not encountered by all hotels before!If you have a chance to go again in the future, you will definitely choose this hotel!"
1,房间里没有电话，有点不方便。早上清扫人员的噪音太大，都不能睡懒觉,"There is no phone in the room, which is a bit inconvenient.The noise of the cleaning staff in the morning can not sleep lazy"
1,服务还不错，前台小姐满热情的，房间不怎么样，宾馆正门对面就是居民区，刚开车去的时候寒了自己一下，后来晚上去其他4、5星的宾馆，竟然还有余房，好后悔，早知道直接碰运气比较好,"The service is not bad. The front desk lady is full of enthusiasm. The room is not very good. Opposite the main entrance of the hotel is the residential area. When I first drove, I was cold. Later, I went to the other 4 or 5 stars at night., I know that it is better to touch your luck directly"
0,"本人于3月27日凌晨入住此酒店，作为一家三星级酒店，竟然没有热水，而前台服务员明知道却不在入住登记时预先告知！当我准备洗澡时发现没热水了，打电话到前台,电话竟然是坏的,而楼层的服务员不见踪影,我只得穿着一次性拖鞋到一楼前台质问,服务员以极其恶劣的态度说：“没有热水就是没有热水，你要不住就退房。”我再三解释说我只有两个小时的休息时间，两小时后还要赶飞机。她则始终无动于衷，好象与她没任何关系。我没办法，只好说让她出示酒店无热水的书面证明，她始终不给，僵持了很久，我这时发现一个大块头站在我身后，一转身是保安，他语气很凶地说“你什么态度？！”我这就奇怪了，我是客人，我还能有什么态度？我洗澡的基本要求得不到满足，还冷冰冰地赶我走，这时候让我退了房去哪里？再找到酒店就天亮了，飞机也要起飞了。这样的酒店能住人吗？把客人伤害了，再来道歉有什么用呢？而且房费照收，一分不得少！我作为携程的老会员以及一为旅游规划师，强烈建议携程慎重考虑与其的合作关系！还有西安市有关的旅游部门，我这里想多说一句，西安作为一个国际型的旅游目的地，西安的服务水平确实不敢恭维，普遍表现在酒店、出租车、民航大巴等方面，游客在西安极无安全感。本人常经过西安，以上是本人的深切体会，往往大众化的服务场所才是真正体现一个城市市民素质和服务水平的地方。补充点评2007年4月5日：另外,酒店的地址描述也不确切,酒店位于西北,而火车站在东北,如何能说毗邻呢?我记得我当时从火车站打车到那里需要十二块钱,估计是在5到6公里吧,莫非出租车绕路了?但从地图上看,酒店所在的西北三与火车站确实不能说是毗邻!","I stayed at this hotel in the early morning of March 27. As a three -star hotel, there was no hot water, and the front desk waiter knew that he was not inform in advance when he was not checked in!When I was about to take a bath, I found that there was no hot water. I called the front desk and the phone turned out to be bad, and the waiter on the floor did not see. I had to wear a disposable slippers to the front desk of the front desk to ask. The waiter said in a very bad attitude: ""If there is no hot water, there is no hot water. If you can't stop, check out. ""I repeatedly explained that I had only two hours of rest, and I had to catch the plane two hours later.She has always been indifferent, as if it has nothing to do with her.I had no way, so I had to let her show her in writing the hotel without hot water that she would never give it and stalemate for a long time. At this time, I found a big piece standing behind me and turned around was a security guard.What attitude?! ""I'm weird, I am a guest, what else can I have?The basic requirements for bathing in my bath were not satisfied, and I rushed me to go coldly. Where did I get out of the room at this time?It was dawn to find the hotel again, and the plane was about to take off.Can such a hotel live?If you hurt the guests, what's the use of apology?And the room fee is collected, there is no point!As the old member of Ctrip and a tourist planner, I strongly recommend that Ctrip carefully considers the cooperative relationship with it!There are also related tourism departments in Xi'an. I want to say one more thing here. As an international tourist destination, Xi'an's service level is indeed not dare to compliment. It is generally manifested in hotels, taxis, civil aviation buses, etc.Xi'an has no sense of security.I often pass through Xi'an. The above is my deep experience. Often, the popular service venue is where the quality and service level of a city citizen is truly reflected.Supplementary comment on April 5, 2007: In addition, the address description of the hotel is also inaccurate. The hotel is located in the northwest, and the railway station is in the northeast. How can I say that it was adjacent to it? I remember that I took a taxi from the train station to there.It is estimated that it is 5 to 6 kilometers. Could it be a taxi detour? But from the map, the northwest of the hotel is indeed adjacent to the train station!"

1,这次入住感到服务人员的工作态度不如以前，整体工作热情也不象其他喜来登那么专业。因为我定的房间满了于是给我升级到行政套房，这个本来是不错的安排，但是不知道为什么偏偏这个房间里早晚都有一股股噪音；而我朋友住在我下面一层，一清早就被行政酒廊准备早餐的声音吵醒。酒店2楼西餐厅服务还是很好的。,"This time I felt that the attitude of the service staff was not as good as before, and the overall work enthusiasm was not as professional as other Sheraton.Because I set up the room full of room, I upgraded me to the administrative suite. This was originally a good arrangement, but I don’t know why there is a noise in this room in the morning and evening; and my friend lives under me.Wake up the sound of breakfast for the administrative lounge.The Western restaurant on the second floor of the hotel is still very good."

1,酒店大堂和室内布置都古色古香。从大堂到客房有一条长长的走廊，走廊旁边还有假山流水，亭台楼阁。耳边一直传来悠悠的民乐声。酒店离开观前街只有一步之遥，晚饭后逛逛马路十分悠闲自得，特别是令自己没有想到的是，居然在观前街上购物消费了许多money！老公、小孩还取笑我：上海不买东西，出来旅游反倒疯狂购物，是不是本末倒置啦？酒店旁还有两个小小的酒吧，挺有品位的，这次行程太匆忙，下次来的话，一定进去坐坐。,"The hotel lobby and indoor layout are antique.There is a long corridor from the lobby to the guest room. There is also a fake mountain flowing water next to the corridor.There has always been a leisurely folk music in the ears.The hotel is only one step away from Guanqian Street. It is very leisurely to walk around the road after dinner, especially what I did not expect is that they actually spent many Money on shopping on Guanqian Street!Husband and children also make fun of me: Shanghai does not buy things, and when traveling, it is crazy about shopping. Is it upside down?There are two small bars next to the hotel, which are very tasteful. This time the trip is too hurried. If you come next time, you must go in."

1,通过携程选择入住该酒店，我个人感觉此酒店服务很值得称道。我入住的时候，平时因为胃不是很好，感到不适，打电话至房务中心，服务员在几分钟之内就为我送来了一盒胃药，并礼貌问候。更令我意外的是，过了一段时间服务员又亲自送来了一碗小米粥和一碟生花生米，着实让我感动万分。结账时，我提出结算那盒药的钱，但是被前台小姐笑言婉拒，并说：我们酒店就是您的家外之家，希望您在我们酒店、在日照的每一天都健康、快乐！呜呼，我无言！,"I chose to stay in the hotel through Ctrip, and I personally feel that the hotel service is commendable.When I stayed in, I was usually uncomfortable because I was not very good. I called the Housing Center. The waiter sent me a box of gastric medicine within a few minutes and greets politely.What surprised me even more was that after a while, the waiter personally sent a bowl of millet porridge and a plate of raw peanut rice, which really moved me.At the time of checkout, I proposed the money for the settlement of the medicine, but was smiled at the front desk lady, and said: Our hotel is your home outside the home.

1,服务好，前台接待员挺热情。环境相当不错，楼下就是公园。早上转了转，看到一群MM在做健美操，意外收获：）早餐比上次好很多，新加的番茄鸡蛋卷很好吃。晚上上网网线太短，打了服务电话不到两分钟一位帅哥拿了一条超长的。心中窃喜：；）一个字“爽”下次还会住！,"The service is very enthusiastic.The environment is pretty good, downstairs is the park.In the morning, I turned around and saw a group of MMs doing he aerobics. I accidentally harvested :) Breakfast is much better than last time. The newly added tomato egg rolls are delicious.The Internet cable was too short at night, and a handsome guy took a handsome guy in less than two minutes.Stealing in my heart:;) A word ""Shuang"" will live next time!"

1,由于奥运会的关系，北京的宾馆都好贵啊！公司出差，订了这家。整体感觉不错，房间虽然小，但是挺干净的，而且服务态度也很好。值得一提的是他们的餐厅，中午的商务套餐很不错，实惠、量足、干净。不久之后又要去北京出差了，可能还住他们家！,"Due to the Olympic Games, the hotels in Beijing are so expensive!The company went on a business trip and ordered this.The overall feels good. Although the room is small, it is very clean and the service attitude is very good.It is worth mentioning that their restaurant has good business package at noon, affordable, sufficient, and clean.Soon after, I would go to Beijing for a business trip, and may be living in their house!"
1,不错的酒店，房间干净，安静（15楼）。客户请客就在酒店的包房吃的，味道很好。中式早餐略有不足，没什么可选，味道还可以。,"Good hotel, the room is clean and quiet (15th floor).Customers are eating in the hotel's private room, and it tastes good.The Chinese breakfast is slightly insufficient, there is no choice, and the taste is okay."
1,酒店地点很好，海景房窗外的景色也很美。可以看到栈桥和小青岛，隔海就是沙滩。服务很体贴，很喜欢楼层的小零食吧。房间设置也很周到。虽然不大，但是个很好的度假酒店。美中不足，隔音设施不太好，遇到夜间大吵大闹的邻居，就比较惨了。,"The hotel location is very good, and the scenery outside the sea view room is also beautiful.You can see the trestle bridge and Xiaoqingdao, the sea is the beach across the sea.The service is very considerate, I like the small snacks on the floor.The room settings are also very thoughtful.Although not big, a good resort hotel.The beauty is not enough, and the sound insulation facilities are not very good. It is miserable to meet neighbors at night."
0,这个小旅馆也实在是太差了，卫生条件很差，夜间到达后没有热水洗澡，设备陈旧，水池子铁锈斑累累，卫生间墙角污物随处可见。这还算可以忍受或对付一夜的。作为携程网，竟然在天津新国际机场已经启用快半年了，竟然还在极力推荐这个离机场很远的小旅馆，还说咫尺可见，实在是最为让人不可理解。我在6月25日想预定一个距离机场很近的宾馆，就在携程预定了这个说是机场宾馆，推荐员说距离机场几百米可到，可是我在6月26日乘CA1396航班，在27日凌晨3点下飞机后，乘机场大客车时，大客车管理员说不去这个小旅馆，那我就打车去吧，问了7辆车，都说不去这个小旅馆，怎么都不去呢，最后才打听到这个小旅馆是原来的破机场遗留下的产物，距离我下飞机的新国际机场8公里，机场大客车不经此处，出租车嫌太近，赚钱少，不去，天还下着大雨，给这个小旅馆打电话，没有人接听，这可怎么办呢？。这时机场大客车也没有了，没办法，打了个出租车先到了市区，花去58元钱，又打了一个出租车才给拉到了酒店，这时天已经开始放亮了。这就携程信息不做更新，害得我多花了钱，又耽误时间。建议携程立即将这个小旅馆从预定酒店目录中删除。,"This small hotel is also too bad. The sanitary conditions are poor. After the night arrives, there is no hot water bath, the equipment is old, the rust of the pool is exhausted, and the dirt of the toilet walls can be seen everywhere.This can be tolerated or dealt with overnight.As a Ctrip.com, it has been opened at Tianjin New International Airport for almost half a year. It is still highly recommended that this small hotel far away from the airport. It is also the most incomprehensible to be seen.I wanted to book a hotel very close to the airport on June 25. At the Ctrip's booking, this is the airport hotel. The recommender said that it was hundreds of meters from the airport, but I took the CA1396 flight on June 26.After getting off the plane at 3 am on the 27th, when taking the airport passenger car, the buses administrator said that he could not go to this small hotel, then I took a taxi and asked 7 cars.Go, I finally touched this small hotel as the original product left over the airport. It is 8 kilometers away from the new international airport that I got off the plane. The airport passenger car is not here.It was still raining in the sky. I called this small hotel. No one answered. What should I do?EssenceAt this time, the airport buses were gone. There was no way. I got a taxi first to the city first, spent 58 yuan, and took another taxi to pull to the hotel. At this time, the sky had begun to light up.This is not updated by Ctrip's information, which makes me spend more money and delay time.It is recommended that Ctrip immediately delete this small hotel from the scheduled hotel directory."
0,1、门童不专业，我们是晚上10点到的，下出租时，没人开门不说，连箱子都要自己拿。2、房间太小，浴室也小，不象是四星的标准。3、结帐时竟然说两间浴袍不见了，我们入住时根本就没见过浴袍。还想问酒店要呢！4、入住和结帐都慢，总之以后再去，不会再入住了。,"1. The door children are unprofessional. We arrived at 10 pm. When renting, no one opened the door, and even the box had to take it ourselves.2. The room is too small, and the bathroom is small, not like the standard of four -star.3. During the checkout, I said that the two bathrobes were gone. We never saw a bathrobe at all when we moved in.I want to ask the hotel!4. Checking and checkout are slow."
1,房间虽然小了点，但是比较整洁，服务质量也ok!,"Although the room is a bit small, it is relatively neat and the service quality is OK!"
0,不知道是按什么标准评的四星级酒店，是我见过最差的。设施陈旧，环境嘈杂，停车竟然还要收停车费。价格却不低，性价比简直是无法用语言表达的，总之，差就一个字，很差就两个字，非常差就三个字。以后就算是免费都不住了。建议携程不要跟他家合作，会影响携程的声誉。,"I don't know what the four -star hotels are evaluated according to what standards I have ever seen.The facilities are old, the environment is noisy, and the parking fee is needed to park.The price is not low, and the cost -effectiveness is simply unable to express in words. In short, just one word is one word, two words are very bad, and three words are very bad.Even if it is free in the future, it will not be free.It is recommended not to cooperate with his family, which will affect Ctrip's reputation."
1,酒店还是不错，不过携程的价格还不够好一点。,"The hotel is still good, but the price of Ctrip is not better enough."
0,订了一间420多的房间，房间较大，但地毯非常脏，全是水渍，很难看。服务方面不想提了，入住预授刷了800块，结果送餐不能挂房帐，只能付现金原因是预授太少，晕了。上午开通了长途电话，晚上回去又不能打长途，还要从新开通。早晨8点被吵醒，整个大楼都是轰鸣声，原因未知。电梯慢的要死，住14楼，平均等3－4分钟，来回做了6次电梯，有5次里都是挤满了酒气醺醺叼着厌倦的人，谈论酒店的mm，语言不堪入耳。结帐时非常慢，等了10分钟前台告诉我房间有消费，再等10分钟，才告诉我喝了2瓶可乐。最郁闷的是，8月8日奥运开幕式，电视突然没信号了！忍无可忍，前台的人解释更是牛，说可能是遭到不法分子破坏，听到这真快疯了。本来想打一分，可在电视信号恢复后，听到前台mm的真诚道歉，还给我讲开幕式前面我没看到的场景，气也没了一半了，服务给2分吧。,"I ordered a room with more than 420 rooms. The room was large, but the carpet was very dirty, all water stains, and it was ugly.I do n’t want to mention the service. The pre -scoring of 800 yuan is checked. As a result, the food delivery cannot be hung up. It can only be paid too much cash.The long -distance call was opened in the morning, and I couldn't make a long distance when I went back at night.It was awakened at 8 o'clock in the morning, and the entire building was roar, the reason was unknown.The elevator wants to die slowly. Live on the 14th floor, with an average of 3-4 minutes. I made 6 elevators back and forth. There were 5 times in 5 times that they were full of alcohol.EssenceIt was very slow at checkout. After waiting for 10 minutes, I told me that the room had consumption. I waited for another 10 minutes before telling me to drink 2 bottles of Cola.The most depressed is that on the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games on August 8th, the TV suddenly had no signal!It is unbearable. The person in the front desk explained is even more cattle, saying that it may be destroyed by criminals, and it is really crazy when he hear it.I originally wanted to make a point. After the TV signal was restored, I heard the sincere apology of the front desk MM, and gave me the scene I didn't see before the opening ceremony. The anger was not halfway. The service was 2 points."
0,酒店位置还行，就是服务一般。我在携程上预定的两晚房，却只给我登记了一天，第二天中午续房收了押金，结果服务员晚上十一点还跑到房间来收押金，说中午续房的押金不够：（。,"The location of the hotel is okay, that is, the service is average.I booked a two -night room I booked on Ctrip, but I only registered for one day. The deposit was collected at noon the next day. As a result, the waiter ran to the room at 11 o'clock in the evening to collect the deposit, saying that the deposit of the renewal of the room at noon was not enough:."
0,传说中的四星挂牌，2星标准，倒也恰当。房间的地毯确实很脏，其他还行啦！卫生纸确实如传说中的少，两个人有点不够用。服务嘛，不知道，因为是跟携程团去的，一大早就走了，没机会领略。早餐，确实品种少，除了牛奶（是奶粉加糖价开水，亲眼所见）和粥，该冷的是冷的，该热的也还是冷的。稍微晚去就排队加排队。酒店周围都是卖土特产，水果店和小便利店（杂货店）也多。补充点评2007年10月22日：客房提供的居然不是袋泡茶，而是新鲜的绿茶，感觉很好。没有咖啡，有需要的得自带。没有免费矿泉水。,"The legendary four -star listing, 2 -star standard, is also appropriate.The carpet in the room is really dirty, and the others are okay!The toilet paper is indeed as less as the legendary, and the two are a bit insufficient.Well, I do n’t know, because I went to the Ctrip group, I left early in the morning and did n’t have the opportunity to appreciate it.Breakfast, there are indeed few varieties, except for milk (it is milk powder and sugar price boiling water, and see what you see) and porridge. The cold is cold, and the hot one is still cold.Go in line and queue up a little later.There are soil -selling specialties around the hotel, and there are also many fruit shops and small convenience stores (grocery stores).Supplementary comment on October 22, 2007: The guest rooms are not bubbles of tea, but fresh green tea, which feels good.Without coffee, you need to bring your own.There is no free mineral water."
0,1，服务态度极差。从没有见到过服务员微笑过，个个板着脸。由于我在当地入住时间无法确定，所以先交1天押金，谁知道，才过了12点半，连续来了几个电话，催着交押金，下到前台时，前台摆着个臭脸，还准备跟我吵架。头一次遇到。2，黑店性质。三楼得桑拿房是黑店，奉劝各位不要去，我还是服务员透露给我知道得，要不我还不知道能不能回来。服务员只说三楼桑拿属于他们承包出去，不归他们管，但是也是在你们酒店啊。这样不是黑人吗？3，骚扰电话频繁。从九点钟开始，就来了个电话，说了不要，他们10点还来电话，我干脆不接，谁知道每隔30分钟来一次电话，最后是被我骂了才不打，但是第二晚继续来骚扰。4，退房时间长。7点10分下去退房，让打发票，搞了半天居然打发票得机器坏了，服务员还不主动给客人发票，如果我不问他们就互弄过去了。最后在我强烈得要求下，才找到IT来修理，天啊。我是8点10分得火车，等到7点50才把发票给我。5，综合分数，如果有0分我直接给0分。,"1. The service attitude is very poor.I have never seen the waiter with a smile, all of which are on their faces.Since I could not be determined in the local area, I paid the deposit for 1 day first. Who knows, only 12:30 passed, and a few continuous calls came to urge the deposit.Also prepare to quarrel with me.The first time I met.2. Black shop nature.The sauna room on the third floor is a black shop. I advise you not to go. I still disclose it to me. Otherwise, I don't know if I can come back.The waiter only said that the third -floor sauna belongs to them to contract and does not return to them, but it is also in your hotel.Isn't this black?3. Frequent harassment calls.From nine o'clock, I called and said no. They called at 10 o'clock. I simply did not answer it. Who knew that every 30 minutes came to the phone, and finally I was scolded by me.Continue to harass on the second night.4. Check out for a long time.At 7:10, let's check out for the invoice. After half a day, the invoicing was broken. The waiter did not take the initiative to invoic the guests. If I didn't ask them, I got it.Finally, at my strong request, I found IT to repair it. God.I got the train at 8:10 and waited until 7:50 to me.5. Comprehensive score, if there are 0 points, I give 0 points."
1,因为是去会展中心参展，这家还是比较理想的，打车沿着金水路一直下去就到会展中心了。老外对酒店比较满意。自然，价格也不低。稍微有些美中不足的是，早餐就在大堂下沉的空间里，烹炸煎烤的，味道充溢大堂。可能有些人不在乎吧，但我是不大喜欢那种味道的。要是能改善一下通风的话，应该会更好吧？补充点评2008年5月27日：对了，他们饭店有7座专车可租，去机场的话，人多或行李多，可以租，应该比打两辆出租舒服加实惠。可以侃价的，呵呵！附加一句跟酒店无关的话：郑州机场的出租，那叫黑啊！打到这家饭店，花了151块，而走的时候，从饭店打到机场，只花了73块！差整整一倍啊！提醒大家一定小心！！,"Because I went to the exhibition center to participate in the exhibition center, this one is still ideal. Taxi will go to the Convention and Exhibition Center along the Jinshui Road.Foreigners are more satisfied with the hotel.Naturally, the price is not low.A little bit of disadvantage is that the breakfast is in the room where the lobby sinks, fried and fried, and the taste is full of the lobby.Maybe some people don't care, but I don't like that taste.If it can improve ventilation, it should be better?Supplementary comment on May 27, 2008: By the way, they have 7 special cars to rent in their hotel. If you go to the airport, there are many people or luggage, which can be rented.You can have a price, haha!Adding a sentence has nothing to do with the hotel: the rental of Zhengzhou Airport, that is black!It took 151 yuan to hit this restaurant, and when I left, I hit the airport from the hotel, only 73 yuan!Twice the difference!Remind everyone to be careful!Intersection"
1,是我在北戴河附近住过的的比较舒适的饭店，是凯莱管理的，从服务到设施都比较正规。房间有点旧了，但还算整洁，水有点黄，建议多带点瓶装水饮用，环境不错。服务也不错，效率很高。让我比较满意的是餐厅，饭菜口味不错，而且不是很贵，还专门为小宝宝们准备了塑料的餐具，很周到。,"It is a more comfortable restaurant I have lived near Beidaihe. It is managed by Kaile. It is more formal from service to facilities.The room is a bit old, but it is still clean and the water is a bit yellow. It is recommended to bring more bottles of water to drink, and the environment is good.The service is also good and efficient.What makes me more satisfied is the restaurant. The meal has a good taste and is not very expensive. It also prepared plastic tableware for the babies, which is very thoughtful."
1,房间赶不上绵州酒店，服务还是不错！但电梯太差！,"The room can't catch up with the Mianzhou Hotel, the service is still good!But the elevator is too bad!"
1,位置挺好，标准间特宽敞，服务水平一般．若到星海广场玩一天并晚上观看剧场真人秀可选此店入住．,"The location is very good, the standard rooms are spacious, and the service level is average.If you go to Xinghai Plaza for a day and watch the theater reality show at night, you can choose this shop to stay."
1,原本在网上订了两个套房，入住后，携程还给我打电话问是否只入住了一间，要扣我信用卡里的钱。真不知道酒店与携程是如何衔接的？宾馆反馈2007年12月7日：我们非常感谢您的留言，非常抱歉由于一些小误会给您带来的困惑。根据我们的担保订房要求，对于确认担保的房间未入住的会收取当天房费。当然，我们也会进一步加强与携程的沟通与协调，让您今后的入住感觉更加舒适与愉快。,"Originally booked two suite on the Internet, after check -in, Ctrip also called me if I only stayed in one room, and deducted the money in my credit card.I really don't know how the hotel and Ctrip are connected?Hotel feedback on December 7, 2007: We are very grateful to your message, and I'm sorry for the puzzles brought to you due to some small misunderstandings.According to our guarantee reservation requirements, those who confirm the guarantee room will charge the same day fee.Of course, we will also further strengthen communication and coordination with Ctrip, so that your future check -in will feel more comfortable and pleasant."
1,"房间不错,只是上网速度慢得无法忍受,打开一个网页要等半小时,连邮件都无法收。另前台工作人员服务态度是很好，只是效率有得改善。","The room is good, but the Internet speed is too slow to bear. It takes half an hour to open a webpage and cannot even receive emails.In addition, the front desk staff has a good service attitude, but the efficiency is improved."
1,非常的好！我和我老婆对这家客栈赞不绝口。基本上可以达到四星级的房屋设施标准。自带的庭院非常美丽。酒店的服务员和老板人都很好。早饭非常好吃，牛奶，馒头，鸡蛋，和肉酱面。真的让人有家的感觉。下次我一定还要住在那里。,"very good!My wife and I praised this inn.Basically, the four -star housing facility standards can be met.The courtyard comes with is very beautiful.The hotel waiters and bosses are very good.Breakfast is very delicious, milk, steamed buns, eggs, and meat sauce noodles.It really makes people feel home.Next time I must live there."
0,我订的是商务大床房，给我的房间是8418房，床是挺大的，但是房间太小了，基本上是进屋就上床了，连椅子都放不开，但是有个看不到海景的大阳台，不知道是怎么设计的，估计这房应该是个单人房改的。如家的电视节目有马赛克，给前台打电话，他们说叫工程师来看看，结果过了几分钟来了个拿对讲机的大婶，告诉我们是信号的原因，所有房间的节目都这样，要到晚上才能好，我们想那就算了，可是过会和我们同行来的另一个房间的朋友说他们的电视信号一直很好，气死了，如家竟然这样骗顾客，给前台打电话，又改口说是部分房间的信号是这样。晚上8点多的时候信号好了，但是第二天依然还是有马赛克，到了晚上也没好。住了三晚，拖鞋一直没给换，都破了。第三天蚊香片没给换。房间内的饮水机有很浓的84消毒水味，根本没法喝，自己到家乐福买的桶装水。只有一个床头灯，而且接触不良，不打它不亮。建议以后入住这家的顾客不要住这个带阳台的房间，没有阳台的房间还是很大的。补充点评2008年6月23日：忘了说了，地址位置还算不错，公交车挺多，出去玩的话先去看看公交车的路线吧，不过车开的也很慢，我们坐了一辆从石老人始发的车回如家，结果那车最高时速才40迈，一点不夸张。步行去八大关也很近，也可步行去二浴，就是它的大门不是对着香港西路，有时出租车会估计要几个圈子才开到（青岛的出租司机良心大大的坏了，宁可被全国人民骂也要坑那几块钱),"I booked a large business bed room. The room for my room was 8418, and the bed was quite large, but the room was too small. Basically, I went to bed when I entered the house.I do n’t know how to design the big balcony of the sea view. It is estimated that this room should be a single -person house reform.Rujia's TV show has mosaic, calling the front desk, they said that the engineer came to see, and after a few minutes, a big sister who came to take a walkie -talkie told us that it was the signal. The programs in all rooms were like this. In the eveningBe better, even if we think, but we will say that their TV signals have always been good and angry, and they will be furious.This is the signal of some rooms.At about 8 o'clock in the evening, the signal was good, but there was still mosaic the next day, and it was not good at night.After living for three nights, the slippers have not been changed, and they have been broken.On the third day, mosquito coils were not changed.The water dispenser in the room has a strong 84 disinfection water flavor, and it can't drink at all.There is only one bedside lamp, and it is poorly exposed.It is recommended that the customers who stay in this house should not live in this room with a balcony. There is still a large room without a balcony.Supplementary comment on June 23, 2008: Forgot to say, the address location is pretty good, there are a lot of buses, let's take a look at the route of the bus if you go out, but the car is very slow.The car from the old man from the old man returned home, but the highest speed of the car was only 40 yuan per hour, which was not exaggerated.Walking to the eight levels is also very close, you can also walk to the second bath, that is, its door is not facing Hong Kong West Road. Sometimes the taxi will estimate that a few circles will be driven (Qingdao's rental driver's conscience is greatly broken, rathering it, it is better to be cocoa.Those a few dollars are scolded by the people of the whole country)"
1,"到桐庐游玩,4月30日晚上一行9人入住上服假日山庄,总结如下:1.地段不错,距离市中心10分钟车程,离几大景点都挺近;傍山空气好非常安静,如果事先做一些功课位置很好找;2.前台小姐服务意识不错,态度很好留下深刻印象;3.酒店餐厅饭菜价廉物美,作为家庭旅游用餐很实惠(9人连啤酒饮料才吃了二百多),10元早餐一定要尝一下,众人称赞下吃不了的还打包带走;4.房间很干净,作为这个价位的宾馆设施基本令人满意,只是浴室的淋浴房实在是要考虑重新改造了;总之,适合家庭出游~下一次去还会选择这家的~~~~~","Go to Tonglu to play.

1,1、酒店环境不错，地理位置佳。到十全街、凤凰街挺方便的。属于闹中取静的那种。2、客房里设施齐全、干净，比较方便。卫浴设施也挺好的。插头挺多的，很好。房间很干净，也挺温馨的。3、自助餐还可以。美中不足之处：1、卫生纸的质量比较差。2、饭店里最好可以提供（自助）洗衣、干衣的服务。3、房间里的小冰箱效果不好，声音也比较响。反正不用，我就关掉了。总体感觉不错，性价比高，下次还来住。,"1. The hotel has good environment and good geographical location.It is convenient to go to Shiquan Street and Phoenix Street.It belongs to the kind of quiet.2. The facilities in the rooms are complete and clean, which is more convenient.The bathroom facilities are also very good.There are a lot of plugs, very good.The room is clean and warm.3. The buffet is okay.Disadvantages of beauty: 1. The quality of toilet paper is relatively poor.2. It is best to provide (self -service) laundry and dry clothes in the hotel.3. The small refrigerator in the room is not good, and the sound is relatively loud.Anyway, I turned off.Overall feels good, cost -effective, I will live next time."
0,我很少做酒店点评，但这个酒店确实是我近年住的最差的酒店。地方非常不好找，大部份的士司机都找不到，太偏了。酒店房间很小，如果有两个人，连个行李都没地方放。卫生间漏水，马桶不通（我们两个房间都一样）。空调不管用，一个晚上卡卡的响，早餐极差。唯一好点就是边上有个公园，早餐爬走起来可走走。虽然那里面有一堆老人在晨练。总体意见：在这个价位下，不值得入住。,"I rarely make hotel reviews, but this hotel is indeed the worst hotel I have lived in recent years.The place is very difficult to find. Most of the taxi drivers can't find it, which is too biased.The hotel room is very small. If there are two people, there is no place to put luggage.The bathroom leaked and the toilet was not connected (both of us two rooms).Regardless of the air conditioner, the breakfast was very poor for a night of Kaka.The only better thing is that there is a park on the side, and you can walk away for breakfast.Although there are a bunch of elderly people in it in the morning.Overall opinion: In this price, it is not worth checking in."
1,房间不错晚上很安静，早餐供应丰富又实惠，主要是离机场很近，步行大概10分钟路程,"The room is very quiet at night, the breakfast supply is rich and affordable, mainly because it is close to the airport. It takes about 10 minutes to walk."
1,洒店环镜和卫生都还可以，也较新。价格适中，但靠马路边，晚上有点吵，一大早就醒了。,"Saodian ring mirrors and hygiene are okay, and they are relatively new.The price is moderate, but by the side of the road, it is a bit noisy at night and wakes up early in the morning."
1,酒店地理位置不错，硬件设施稍次。总体还可以。,"The hotel has a good geographical location, and the hardware facilities are a little bit.Overall."
1,酒店位置不错，在市中心最热闹的地方，购物和吃饭都很方便。标房房间比较小，卫生间台盆下水有点慢，其它都不错。,"The hotel location is good. It is very convenient to shop and eat in the most lively place in the city center.The benchmark room is relatively small, and the bathroom basin is a bit slow, and everything else is good."
0,很怀疑五星酒店的评价标准。三星都不如，很失望！,"Very doubt the evaluation criteria of the five -star hotel.Samsung is not as good as, very disappointed!"
0,"明明订房是要大床房,给房就给双床房,后来请携程去协调才给大床房.住这里快要热死,号称五星规格,居然除六楼以外,其他楼层的空调是中央控制,房内都无法调整.不幸的是控制中央控制的人把冷气都关了,只能送风.我打电话找他们,他们的理由是天气不热,前几天都下雨,很冷,所以关了.我说那今天气转热了,都快三十度,是否可以开冷气,他又说现在是晚上,所以不能开,要白天才方便开.我又说,那我今晚忍忍,忍到明天,请明天开冷气行吗.他居然说,明天也不行,因为明天可能有别的客人不喜欢开冷气.我就这样和酒店的人兜圈子.后来酒店的人说明天帮我换到六楼好了.叫我第二天下午三点前回酒店换房,但我第二天回来换房,前台居然说不知道这事,简直就是玩弄客户.后来我快翻脸了,这时就可以换房了.你们说,这酒店好不好,自己猜吧.补充点评2008年7月2日：刚写完我的点评,就看到下面那位客人真可怜,到这里写了些事实,还要遭遇酒店抬杠式的回覆.不知虚心检讨.这就是""五星酒店的服务心态""","Obviously, the booking is to have a large bed. Give the room for a double bed. Later, I asked Ctrip to coordinate to give the big bed room. Living here is about to die. It is called five -star specifications. Except for the sixth floor, the air conditioners on the other floors are centrally controlled by the central government., Instead of adjusting the room. Unfortunately, those who control the central government have turned off the air -conditioning, and can only send the wind. I called them. The reason for them was that the weather was not hot. It was raining a few days ago.So I turned it off. I said that the air is getting hot today, it is almost thirty degrees, whether it can be turned on, he said that it is night, so it cannot be opened, and it is convenient to open it during the day. I said, then I can bear it tonightForbearance, forbearance to tomorrow, do you want to start air -conditioning tomorrow? He actually said, tomorrow will not work, because there may be other guests tomorrow that other guests do not like to turn on air -conditioning. I will go around with the hotel people. LaterIt ’s better to change to the sixth floor. Let me go back to the hotel to change the house before 3 pm the next day, but I came back to change the house the next day. The front desk actually said that I did n’t know about it. I just played with the customer. LaterYou can change the house. You said, this hotel is good, guess it yourself. Add comments July 2, 2008: Just after writing my review, I saw the guest below really pitiful. I wrote some facts here., Also encounter a hotel lift -type response. I do not know the humbly review. This is the ""service mentality of the five -star hotel"""
0,最不满意的是这家的空调，效果一点也不好，而且噪音超大。最糟糕的是停车场，竟然在马路对面，而且必须要酒店保安领着才能开车停车，建议自驾车的千万别住,"The most dissatisfied is this air conditioner, which is not good at all, and has a lot of noise.The worst is the parking lot, which is opposite the road, and you must lead the hotel security to drive to park."
1,还可以，就是ＣＴＲＩＰ上的酒店优惠价格现在优势不大，很多酒店前台也拿的到，ＣＴＲＩＰ的价钱．有时候还能便宜一些．,"It is okay, that is, the preferential price of the hotel on the CTRIP is not high now, and many hotels have also been taken at the front desk of the hotel. The price of CTRIP.Sometimes it can be cheaper."
1,说是五星，房间比较小，网络还是有问题，但是服务人员业务能力比较强，很快搞定,"It is said that it is five stars, the room is relatively small, and there is still a problem with the network, but the service staff has a strong business ability, and it will quickly get it."
1,环境不错，服务也可以，不太好找，不能上网实在不方便,"The environment is good, the service is okay, it is not easy to find, it is not convenient to get online"
1,酒店是新装修，劳动西路，离田汉大剧院很近，看表演方便,The hotel is a new renovation.
0,"这酒店的管理实在太有毛病了!10.22号通过携程订1晚.等要续房的时候说房间满?!!没有任何提前的告知,人还没走就把房间租给别人？!","The management of this hotel is really too wrong! No. 10.22 binds 1 night through Ctrip. When you want to renew the room, say that the room is full? !! Without any advance informs, the room rented the room to others?"""
1,酒店没有CCTV的节目，很奇怪，又不是在国外,"The hotel does not have a CCTV program, it is strange, but it is not abroad"
1,1：地毯很脏，用具如水壶和马桶老化啦2：服务非常好3：地热矿泉水挺好的,"1: The carpet is very dirty, the use of kettle and toilet is aging 2: The service is very good 3: Geothermal mineral water is pretty good"
1,"房间设施还不错.就是有一个缺点.我住的是套房.就是客厅里的沙发坐着只能对着一副书法.为什么不是个电视呢.还算不错.还有,离周庄景区远了点.走走也要15分钟.","The room facilities are not bad. There is a disadvantage. I live in a suite. That is, the sofa in the living room can only face a calligraphy. Why not a TV? It's not bad. Also, it's a bit far from the Zhouzhuang Scenic Area.It takes 15 minutes to walk."
0,"我通过携程定的豪华标间,价格4百元,以为这个价钱至少可以住到干净整洁的酒店吧,至于豪华,根本是没想过;但即使这样低的心理期待下,这酒店还是把我吓了一跳;一进房间就是一股霉味和臭味混杂的味道;等进了厕所,才知道房间的味道与之相比简直是小巫见大巫,简","I have the price of 400 yuan through Ctrip's luxury room. I thought that the price could be at least to stay in a clean and tidy hotel. As for the luxury, I never thought about it; but even if such a low psychological expectation, this hotel still took me me.I was startled; as soon as I entered the room, it was a mixed taste and odor; when I entered the toilet, I realized that the taste of the room was a little witch compared to it."

1,外面的环境一般，到处是赶火车的人，下了机场大巴要走10多分钟到酒店。酒店的房间还是很不错的，干净整洁，空调也很好，服务还是挺热情的免费宽带，速度可以。离市中心很近，走路打的都行，打车7块钱到八一广场。总的来说还是值得推荐。,"The outside environment is average, and people who catch the train everywhere. After getting off the airport bus for more than 10 minutes to the hotel.The hotel's room is still very good, clean and tidy, the air conditioner is also very good, the service is still very enthusiastic free broadband, the speed is okay.It is very close to the city center, and it is OK to walk, 7 yuan a taxi to Bayi Plaza.In general, it is worth recommending."
1,已经第2次入住啦，老板对酒店非常满意哦，不然也不会订了，西西,"I have been staying for the second time, the boss is very satisfied with the hotel, otherwise it will not be ordered, Xixi"
0,以前在南通、无锡住过很多次格林豪泰，感觉还不错，这次来马鞍山就住在这里。不过床上有虫子，不知道是虱子还是跳蚤，住了2天，全身上下被咬了17个疙瘩，感觉很不爽，都痒了5天了，还没好,"I used to live in Green Haotai many times in Nantong and Wuxi. I feel pretty good.However, there are bugs on the bed. I don't know if it is lice or fleas. After staying for 2 days, I was bitten on the whole body and I felt very unhappy. It had been itchy for 5 days."
0,"地方不好找,其实就是国际青年旅社.环境一般,设施简陋到地铁站要走10多分钟.","The place is not easy to find, in fact, the international youth hostel. The environment is average. It takes more than 10 minutes to go to the subway station."
1,10楼和27楼是同样的价格，有点想不通，当然是要住27楼啦。10楼的网络不通，电脑部的人居然不知道，白忙了一个多小时，最后换房才解决。等电梯很考验人的耐心，唉。。。不过酒店其他地方都不错的，早餐丰富，下次还会住这里。,"The same price on the 10th and 27th floors is a bit unreasonable. Of course, you have to live on the 27th floor.The Internet on the 10th floor is not available, and the people on the computer do not know. Bai was busy for more than an hour, and finally changed the house to solve it.Waiting for the elevator to test people's patience, alas.EssenceEssenceHowever, the hotel is good in other parts of the hotel. Breakfast is rich and will live here next time."
1,没有参加过评价，但感觉很多酒店的评价不客观。这次参与一下。此酒店我个人觉得在西安应属于性价比比较好的。房间大小设施及服务都不错，前台的行李员给我印象很好。很重要的是位置很好。离大雁塔及小雁塔都很近。只是担心未来可能会有问题，感觉目前的经营上有点杂乱，好像有很多公司入住包房。,"I have not participated in the evaluation, but I feel that the evaluation of many hotels is not objective.Participate this time.I personally think that this hotel should be better cost -effective in Xi'an.The size and services of the room are good, and the luggagers at the front desk are very impressed.The important thing is that the location is very good.It is close to the Big Wild Goose Pagoda and the Xiaoyan Pagoda.I just worry that there may be problems in the future. I feel that the current operation is a bit messy, as if many companies are in the private room."
1,很安静，周围环境不错。交通较便捷。但周围娱乐设施，或者饮食之处不多。,"Very quiet, the surrounding environment is good.Transportation is more convenient.But there are not many entertainment facilities or diets."
1,前台没有传说的那么慢，我去的时候还可以。整体服务还不错。当时是3月份去的，房间有点冷，洗澡的时候直打哆嗦。网速还可以。,"The front desk is not as slow as the legend, I can still.The overall service is not bad.At that time, I went in March, and the room was a bit cold, and I slammed it when I took a bath.The network speed is ok."
1,看了前面的介绍，今年5.1去了此宾馆，感觉是：1.我去了龙门石窟、关林庙和王城广场，乘坐公交车很方便；2.早餐很一般。累了一天，晚上回去后没热水洗澡，只能硬挺着洗冷水。酒店服务员告诉我锅炉坏了，狂晕！3.服务人员的态度相当不错，向他们咨询出行的问题都能得到耐心细致的答复；4.相对酒店的设施，价格偏高。,"After reading the previous introduction, I went to this hotel at 5.1 this year. It feels: 1. I went to Longmen Grottoes, Guanlin Temple and Wangcheng Square. It is convenient to take a bus; 2. Breakfast is very average.After a day of tired, I didn't take a bath after I went back at night, and I could only stiffly wash the cold water.The hotel waiter told me that the boiler was broken and fainted!3. The attitude of the service staff is quite good, and the questions about traveling to them can be patient and meticulous; 4. Compared with the hotel's facilities, the price is high."
1,整体感觉还不错，房间比较干净，服务也比较好，美中不足的是早餐品种较少，这也是山东酒店的通病，只有济南、青岛几家酒店早餐可以，其他普遍都一般。另外酒店略显陈旧。,"The overall feeling is not bad. The room is relatively clean and the service is better. The disadvantage is that there are fewer breakfast varieties. This is also a common problem of the Shandong Hotel. Only the breakfast of several hotels in Jinan and Qingdao can be generally average.In addition, the hotel is slightly old."
1,"我是7-10号入住的豪华海景大床房，通过携程预定之前，曾给蓝天宾馆打过电话，当时是告知我没房了，我还比较郁闷。但是就抱着试试看的想法，在携程提交了一个订单，没想到居然给我发短信确认了！当时我还很是惊讶，因为我是带着宝宝去的，怕有误。后来到达威海后打电话给总台确认一下，告诉我预定没问题。这才放心下来。不愧是携程网友评价最高的酒店。服务比较好，还提前为我们准备好了婴儿床，整体服务员的待人接物都很礼貌热情。海景被前面的启明假日酒店破坏了一些，但还是不错的，躺在床上就可以看到海。早餐也不错，很丰富，有中式、西式、南朝鲜式，日式的。我个人喜欢西式的早餐，樱桃巧克力奶油布丁和蛋挞都不错，蛋挞还是冰过的，LP喝粥的时候小声跟我随便说了一句忘再拿个勺子了，服务员听到就给拿来，还主动为我的宝宝准备婴儿椅。我都想把早餐当午餐来吃了，哈哈。以后如果去威海度假，还住这里！提个小建议：晚报可以每天送一份，那东西不过块八毛的，我在广州住过酒店每天都给送羊城晚报。水果也可以每天送两个，一般出来玩一天回来的客人吃个桃子或小柿子还是很高兴的，成本也不过一两块，呵呵。补充点评2008年7月11日：忘记说了，第一天住在那里浴缸的下水阀似乎不严实，漏水比较快，导致我放的大半缸水漏下去不少，洗澡就只能边放水边泡澡，这就哗哗响而且不环保浪费水。第二天早上出去的时候跟服务员说了，晚上回来发现应该是处理过了，不漏了。服务还是比较上心的。但是后来，还是有些小漏，呵呵。宾馆反馈2008年7月11日：尊敬的宾客，您好，感谢您的留言！您提出的需求,我们将尽力满足，欢迎你提出宝贵的建议，也希望在您下次入住的时候为为您提供更优质的服务。","I was a luxurious seascape bed room 7-10. Before Ctrip was scheduled, I called the Lan Sky Hotel. At that time, I told me that I had no house, and I was more depressed.But I tried the idea of trying, and submitted an order in Ctrip. I did not expect to send me a text message to confirm it!I was still surprised at the time, because I took my baby, I was afraid of mistakes.After arriving at Weihai, I called the main station to confirm and told me that the booking was fine.Then rest assured.It is worthy of the most evaluated hotel in Ctrip.The service is better, and we have prepared the crib for us in advance. The overall waiters are polite and enthusiastic.The sea view was destroyed by the hotel in the front of Qiming, but it was still good. You can see the sea in bed.Breakfast is also good, very rich, there are Chinese, Western, South Korean style, Japanese -style.I personally like Western -style breakfast. Cherry chocolate cream pudding and egg tart are good. The egg tarts are still ice. When LP drinks porridge, I whispered to me and forgot to take a spoon.Take the initiative to prepare baby chairs for my baby.I want to eat breakfast as lunch, haha.If you go to Weihai for vacation in the future, live here!Make a small suggestion: The Evening News can be delivered every day. That thing is not too much. I live in a hotel in Guangzhou to send Yangcheng Evening News every day.Fruits can also be given two a day. Generally, guests who come back to play a day are very happy to eat peaches or small persimmons. The cost is only one or two pieces, haha.Supplementary comment on July 11, 2008: Forgot to say that the launch valve of the bathtub there on the first day seemed to be not strict, and the leakage was relatively fast, which led to a lot of water leaking.Take a bath, this is rushing and not environmentally friendly.When I went out the next morning, I told the waiter. I came back to find that it should be dealt with at night without leaking.The service is still more attentive.But later, there was still a little omissions, haha.Hotel feedback on July 11, 2008: Dear guest, hello, thank you for your message!The needs you put forward, we will try our best to meet, welcome you to make valuable suggestions, and hope to provide you with better services for you next time you stay."
1,虽离机场和市中心远了一点，但服务生笑脸相迎，房间内相关旅游者的资料准备周到，体现出处处为客人着想，最喜欢窗台上的鲜花，有欧洲风情的感觉。妈妈推开窗，见窗台上灿烂盛开的花朵高兴得合不拢嘴。宾馆反馈2008年5月8日：非常高兴您和您的母亲能喜欢泰逸酒店，祝您及您的家人身体健康，事事顺心。2008年5月11日，母亲节，泰逸鲜花盛开。同样的祝福献给您的母亲，也祝愿天下母亲泰逸安康！,"Although it is a little far from the airport and the city center, the waiter meets the smiles.

This hotel looks good on the outside. The most inside is tied with such cheap hotels such as home or 7 days. I have lived in all star hotels.This is the least compliance with the standard of 4 stars. If the 4 -star reference is based on the northern Jiayuan of Beijing and the Huaxia Hotel in Guangzhou, there is no difference between him in my eyes and the street. I really don’t know his four.Where does the stars come from? The front desk has a bad attitude, and there is no basic smiley face to welcome people. The restaurant on the 3rd floor of the hotel is even worse, and there are few dishes in the menu.If you are chopped, do n’t come to eat, the taste of the dish is even more dare to compliment. After I checked in the hotel for the first time, I went out to find the hotel. The location of the purple light was not very good.Going to the South Holiday Hotel in Yangjiang, the service attitude is much better, and you can go directly to the beach in front, the mountains and the sea, the real sea view room! Or the small harbor villa I stayed in the next day. This is on the edge of the cliff.In the evening, you can listen to the sea in Xiaotingzi to drink tea. Not far from the hotel, there is a geochotic stall in Mong Kok. Except for sea shrimp, the others are much cheaper than the outside.The real sea view room is also very consistent with Samsung. The point is that these two Samsung are much better than 4 four stars, so it is recommended that you do not stay in the so -called Yangjiang's best 4th star Zijiang.by!"
1,"位置太偏了,不过有机场接机.总的来说还满好的.可以推荐的酒店之一.补充点评2007年11月6日：离连云港市区有点远,去市区办事的朋友得谨慎点吧.其他无特殊,可以推荐吧","The location is too biased, but there are airports to pick up.

1,非常不错的酒店，设施、服务都不错。比较适合度假休息，放松心情。,"Very good hotels, facilities and services are good.It is more suitable for vacation rest and relax."
1,因为看了之前的评论才定的这家酒店，没想到换来了一个惊喜，房间的大窗户对着小花园，没想到能住在苏州的园林里面，很安静，早上几乎是被鸟儿叫醒的。洗手间的设计很好，可以看到电视，衣柜的设计也是，简单方便实用。另外，28元的自助早餐太丰盛了，可能是这里是老牌涉外酒店的缘故，西餐很地道。补充点评2008年8月3日：楼上的是通过那里定的260含早的？比携程便宜呀，还可以免费升级，介绍一下。,"Because I saw the hotel that had only been determined before, I did not expect to get a surprise. The large window of the room was facing the small garden. I did not expect to live in the garden in Suzhou.Wake up.The design of the toilet is very good.

0,房间总体来说不错，比较干净，性价比还可以，只是晚上太晚回去大门是关的，要得叫人起来开门，不太方便。还有空调不是中央空调，冬天挺冷，开着空调噪音又太大。洗澡的地方没有隔断，一洗澡就满地都是水。,"The room is generally good, relatively clean, and the cost -effectiveness is okay.

0,国内外酒店都住过不少，丹东也住过国际酒店20楼，这次是因为办事，才选择这家所谓丹东唯一一家四星级酒店，但从来没有见到过服务质量这么差的酒店，处处和客人为敌。本人14日入住，由于本人是16日晚十一点多的航班，15日中午特意和前台说能否在16日晚六点结帐时，总共收两天半的房钱。前台当时同意，并刷了我两天半的预付款。可等到16日晚六点2分，同志们，就过了两分钟时间，他们居然要收我三天的房钱。当时本人先耐着性子，和前台两个服务员解释。后来一个戴眼镜的女大堂副理也过来。可说来说去，就是说酒店电脑系统六点一过就自动锁定为一天。副理后来打电话请示什么陈经理，我站在旁边亲耳听了个详细。她只是说，有个客人过了六点想退房提出算半天，行不行？得到否定的答案后，她就抬头拒绝了本人。本人告诉她：“你这就叫打电话请示呀？你电话中和你们经理讲了我15日就提出算半天你们同意的事实了吗？”她被问住了！本人由于赶时间，懒得再和她们理论。奉劝携程不要与这家酒店再签订住房合约，免得引来更多的投诉。,"There have been a lot of hotels at home and abroad. Dandong has also lived in the 20th floor of the International Hotel. This time, because of doing things, I chose this so -called Dandong's only four -star hotel, but I have never seen hotels with such poor service quality.Everywhere they are enemies.I stayed on the 14th. Because I was a flight at 11 pm on the 16th, at noon on the 15th, I would like to collect a total of two and a half days of room money when I could check out on the 16th at 6 pm on the 16th.The front desk agreed and brushed me for two and a half days.But until 6:2:00 on the 16th, comrades, after two minutes, they actually had to collect my three -day room money.At that time, I was patient and explained the two waiters at the front desk.Later, a female lobby deputy manager wearing glasses also came over.It can be said that the hotel computer system is automatically locked as one day after six o'clock.The deputy manager later called to show what Manager Chen, I stood next to it and listened to it.She just said that a guest would have to check out for a long time after six o'clock. Can it work?After getting a negative answer, she looked up and rejected herself.I told her: ""Do you call to call for instructions? You told your manager in the phone that I put forward the fact that you agreed for half a day on the 15th?"" She was asked!Because I was in a hurry, I was too lazy to talk to them again.I advise Ctrip not to sign a housing contract with this hotel, so as not to attract more complaints."

0,不得不评价（当地政府接待酒店，真是官宦意识浓厚）：1、关于早餐：此次为08年1月28号入住，2月1日离开，自1月30日早上吃过早餐后一个小时就开始拉肚子，并且还伴有呕吐（根据医生说明是食物中毒了），上午还没怎么太在意，吃了一些自己随身带的药品，没有效果，倒是拉肚子的情况越来越严重，当天晚上根本没有睡觉，并且躺在床上全身发冷；第二实在不行了找了医生开药吃过后于2月1日终于好一些了；1>针对这个情况和酒店联系能不能帮忙买药品，酒店居然让我自己想办法（后来联系前台大副多次沟通了这个情况才勉强答应帮忙出去看看我说的药品‘黄莲素片’但居然给我的答复是外面药店没有这种药；其实对他这个回答我很吃惊，因为这种药可以说每个大大小小的药店都有，所以我可以判断他没有出去问――这样的酒店算什么？？？）；2>以前住这里也出现过这种情况，但没这次严重，也不确定所以没在意；3>根据以前多次住店的情况，结合这次我可以肯定这是酒店的食品卫生有问题，对于一个四星级的酒店我认为没有任何可以解释的理由和借口，希望引起重视；补充：希望在建的5星级能够早日开张迎宾，期待中……,"I have to evaluate (the local government receives the hotel, it is really a strong sense of officials): 1.

0,1、酒店门口的服务生对于客人拎着的行李无动于衷，2、当我们与前台说明通过携程预定时，两个女服务生均面无表情，说了声传真那边已经下班，我们不知道，后来我们又自己打电话给携程，在携程与前台协调期间，他们不肯让我们先登记入住，3、第二天早上起来用早餐，9点还差两分钟进入时，已经收拾得一滴汤也不剩，我们询问服务人员，他们抬头看我们一眼，一点回应也没有，4、到达那两天下雪，酒店大堂写着有军大衣出租，我们想租衣服，询问前台，又是一副欠他们300两银子的表情，说200押金，我们很客气的问能不能看看衣服，他们扔过来一句，没有钥匙，锁起来了，我真奇怪那让我交押金干什么，5、这一点客观来说，可能不是考酒店的错，但是管理真的也很差，我们两间房间半夜和凌晨被莫名其妙的敲了三四次门，本来就有点高原反应，这一来更受罪，都休息不好，6、房间的热水时冷时热，洗澡洗的都冻感冒了。总而言之，当时我们预定了建塘宾馆，就是因为临时停电才换了饭店，两个宾馆的服务简直是天壤之别，第二天一早我们就走了，这个宾馆给我的印象太差了，以后再也不会去。补充点评2007年11月16日：补充一下，我们的车子上有积雪，问宾馆借拖把打扫一下，态度非常傲慢，不肯借！,"1. The waiter at the entrance of the hotel is indifferent to the luggage carried by the guests. 2.

1,感觉前台的服务不错，都是笑盈盈的。出脚十分的方便，轮渡就在对面，唯一的不足的是中午睡觉还是感觉有些吵。早餐是下面的西餐厅，品种比较丰富，下次去一定要去楼上的观海餐厅尝尝，不过我们在马路对面的24层必胜客望下去，那个餐厅好低啊，呵呵。,"I feel that the front desk is good, and they are all laughing.It is very convenient to get out of the foot.

1,从携程上预定了普通双人标间，250/晚，这个价格在上海火车站附近的地段算比较有竞争力了。房间挺干净的，设施比较齐全，卫生间采用了透明的设计，给人感觉不错。服务员很有礼貌，有问必答。提供双人免费早餐，虽然品种不算多，但吃起来还挺舒服的，这些都是比较好的几个环节。提几个不足之处吧，首先是房间比较小，有点儿拥挤的感觉；其次是卫生间的地板很滑，每次进入卫生间都得小心翼翼；最后就是离地铁站还是有那么一段距离的，大概七八百米的样子吧，对于需要经常乘坐地铁的游客还是稍稍有那么一点儿不便。总之，这算是一家中规中矩，物有所值的酒店。对于那些口袋不是很鼓，又想住着舒适安心的朋友来说是个不错的选择。,"From Ctrip, the ordinary double standard room is scheduled to be 250/evening.

1,不知怎么回事，一直想给泰安华侨大厦点评，却一直未成功。因为酒店的服务很好。前一段时间和同事一起去泰安爬泰山，晚上12点出发，前台的服务员告诉我们山上气温低，让我们多加件衣服。挺细心的。因为凌晨退房，走的急，钱包落在床下了。快到山脚时，酒店的服务人员给我们打电话，说捡到我们的钱包了。我们这才发现钱包丢了。当即回到酒店，记得那位值班人员叫苏秀，我们在此表示感谢。谢谢！宾馆反馈2008年6月1日：我们酒店是老牌四星级酒店，员工素质高，个个都有十几年的服务经验，对客服务在泰城数首屈一值，宾客选择我们酒店会住得温馨、安心、放心的。,"Somehow, I always wanted to comment on Tai'an Overseas Chinese Building, but it has not been successful.Because the hotel's service is very good.Some time ago, I went to Tai'an to climb Mount Tai with colleagues and set off at 12 pm. The waiters at the front desk told us that the temperature on the mountain was low, so let us add more clothes.Quite carefully.Because of the early morning, the wallet fell under the bed.When it was at the foot of the mountain, the hotel service staff called us and said that we found our wallet.Then we found that the wallet was lost.I returned to the hotel immediately, remembering that the person on duty was Su Xiu, we would like to thank us here.Thanks!Hotel feedback on June 1, 2008: Our hotel is an old four -star hotel, with high employee quality. All of them have more than ten years of service experience. The number of customers in Thai City is the best value. Guests choose our hotel meeting.Live warm, peace of mind, and assured."
1,服务非常好，锦江大厨的口味也很好。吃饭时，在野兔煲里面发现一根兔子毛，我想看看这里是怎样处理的，就向服务员提出。服务员马上汇报，领班表示给重新做一份，并把菜放在我视线所及的范围内。直到重新做好菜并送上来后，才把原来的撤下。后来快吃完饭时，又在空心菜盘子里发现一个玉米粒大小的土块（泥块）。提出后，领班马上表示在给换一份，并一再致谦。看到他们的态度很好，并且我已经快吃饱了，就表示不需要。最后领班还表示多送一份水果，我谢绝了。就是电梯里面的灯有点暗，头顶像蚌珠一样有16盏灯，还是觉得有点阴森森的。顺便说一下，附近的蜀渔坊特别差，餐厅内热浪滚滚，仔细一看，原来是因为厨房没有门，热气全跑到餐厅来了。最恶心的是吃到一半，桌子上突然出现一只蟑螂，向我的碟子飞快的爬来。与店长交涉（等了他很长时间，他解释说很忙，也许有许多蟑螂...之类的需要管理），他竟然说：“活物是没法管的，就是卫生部门的人来了，也不会说什么。因为蟑螂不是在菜里面发现的。”我靠，难道他们还想卖红烧蟑螂不成？,"The service is very good, and the taste of chef Jinjiang is also very good.When eating, I found a rabbit hair in the wild rabbit pot. I would like to see how it was dealt with, so I proposed to the waiter.The waiter immediately reported that the foreman stated that he would make a copy and put the dishes within the scope of my sight.It wasn't until the dishes were made again and sent it up.Later, when I was about to eat, I found a corn -sized soil (mud) in the hollow dish.After the proposal, the foreman immediately stated that he was changing one and repeatedly humble.Seeing their attitude is good, and I was almost full, I said it was not needed.The last foreman also said that he gave one more fruit, I declined.The lights in the elevator are a bit dark, and there are 16 lamps like mussels in the top of the head, and they still feel a bit gloomy.By the way, the nearby Shu Yufang was particularly bad. The heat waves in the restaurant rolled. Take a closer look. It turned out that because the kitchen had no doors, the hot air ran to the restaurant.The most disgusting thing was to eat half of it, and a cockroach suddenly appeared on the table, climbing to my plate quickly.Nearly negotiated with the store manager (waiting for him for a long time, he explained that he was busy, maybe there are many cockroaches ... and the like), he even said: ""The living creature cannot be managed, that is, the people of the health departmentIf you come, you won't say anything. Because cockroaches are not found in the dish. ""I leaned, did they still want to sell braised cockroaches?"
1,我是十一入住的，酒店已经进入淡季，整个酒店只有一个餐厅营业，而且一大半的菜都没有，二个小商店一个关门，一个连饮料也没有，只有矿泉水喝牛奶，很让人失望，不过房间的确不错，服务一般。,"I stayed in 11th. The hotel has entered the off -season. There is only one restaurant in the entire hotel, and there are no more than half of the dishes. The two small shops are closed, and there is no drink., But the room is really good, the service is average."
1,酒店环境不错，温泉也非常好，最突出的是服务员非常热情。不过有几点需要改进：1）预定的双人鲜花木桶浴，入住时候被告知只可以一个人享用，后来打电话到携程才解决；2）温泉的休息室非要换了衣服才让进去，感觉有点不方便；3）退房速度有点慢。补充点评2008年4月25日：补充一下，酒店的早餐和自助餐不错，品种也比较多，特别是水果特别新鲜而且有很多比较好的品种，例如提子。宾馆反馈2008年5月29日：首先向您的意见表示感谢与深深的歉意，此事我们在接到携程通知后进行了调查，确实是我方对业务知识掌握不足所致；温泉休息室的沙发均为棉质，如着泳衣会导致水分渗入，影响整体的清洁，所以需要劳烦客人在更换干爽衣服后进入，希望您能够谅解；退房时让您等太久非常抱歉，今后我们一定努力加强管理与服务的一致性！,"The hotel environment is good, and the hot spring is also very good. The most prominent is very enthusiastic.However, there are a few points that need to be improved: 1) The predetermined double flower and wood barrel bath is told when I check in, and then I can only enjoy one person, and then call Ctrip to solve it.It feels a bit inconvenient; 3) The speed of check -up is a bit slow.Supplementary comment on April 25, 2008: In addition, the hotel's breakfast and buffet are good, and there are many varieties, especially the fruits are particularly fresh and there are many good varieties, such as Temple.Hotel feedback on May 29, 2008: First of all, I would like to express my gratitude and deep apology to your opinions. We conducted a survey after receiving the notice of Ctrip.The sofas are cotton. If the swimsuit will cause water infiltration and affect the overall cleaning, it is necessary to worry that the guests need to enter after changing dry clothes. I hope you can understand it; you can wait for too long when you check out.Strive to strengthen the consistency of management and services!"
0,优点：价格适中，位置方便；缺点：房间奇小，怪味刺鼻；周围施工，吵闹非凡。结帐奇慢，开个发票半小时。,"Advantages: moderate price, convenient location; disadvantages: the room is small, the strange smell is pungent; the surrounding construction, noisy.The checkout is slow, and the invoice is half an hour."
1,酒店在东营当地是最高档的，服务人员训练有素，服务意识很好。酒店很新，房间也很干净，零点厅的饭菜不错，就是有点贵。早餐很丰盛，据说自助餐也不错，下次再到东营，一定去试试。推荐入住！,"The hotel is the most high -end in Dongying. The service staff is well -trained and the service awareness is very good.The hotel is very new, the room is very clean, the meals in the zero hall are good, but it is a bit expensive.The breakfast is very rich, and it is said that the buffet is also good. I will try to go to Dongying next time.Recommended stay!"
1,"交通:便利的,随便叫辆taxi,肯定知道的;装饰:格调比较深,风格吧.洗浴用品过得去,浴巾显得旧了;服务:订夜宵,能够给予明确的解决方案,让我们叫外卖,不过要自行通过114查询电话似乎有改进的余地;早餐:寒碜2个字.没啥吃的.同时,超过9点的话,几乎没东西可以吃了.和价位类似的酒店例如梅园相比,有很大差距.也是我在类似住房价位吃的最差的一次早餐;其他:checkin的mm值得表扬.携程电话订后10分钟到酒店,酒店尚未收到传真.能够帮我联系携程,而且态度很诚恳.checkout的mm中规中矩.门童,出酒店的时候吝啬于说声:先生好再见再见之类的话语.可能我吹毛求疵?","Transportation: Convenient, just call Taxi, definitely know; decoration: deeper style, style bar. Bathing supplies are available, and bath towels look old; service: ordering supperIt seems that there is a room for improvement through the 114 query telephone; breakfast: 2 words of cold 碜. Nothing to eat. At the same time, if it is more than 9 o'clock, there is almost nothing to eat.There is a big gap. It is also the worst breakfast I ate in similar housing prices; other: Checkin's MM is worthy of praise. After Ctrip's phone call, I arrived at the hotel 10 minutes.Sincerity. Checkout's mm is quite satisfactory. Gate children, when they are out of the hotel, they are stunned: Sir goodbye to goodbye to goodbye. Maybe I am none?"
1,"卫生条件还行,价格也还可以,酒店人员的服务态度也还可以。可付费使用的个人卫生用品(全棉内裤、袜子、无菌毛巾及安全套等)准备的比较齐全。不足之处是房间隔音太差，隔壁和走廊的动静听得一清二楚，而且隔壁吵到很晚，影响休息。另外整个房间没有地毯，但卫生间的门口至少应该放一小块，用于吸水和洗澡后防滑和吸水。","Sanitary conditions are okay, the price is okay, and the service attitude of hotel staff is okay.Personal sanitary products (cotton underwear, socks, sterile towels, condoms, etc.) that can be paid are relatively complete.The shortcoming is that the room sound insulation is too poor. The movements of the next door and the corridor can be heard clearly, and the next door is very late, which affects the rest.In addition, there is no carpet in the entire room, but at least a small piece should be placed at the door of the bathroom to absorb non -slip and water absorption after water absorption and bathing."
1,初次入住京华大酒店感觉大堂非常的靓丽，房间够大非常整洁。东芝液晶电视，HBO。酒店三楼中餐厅的扬州狮子头爽嫩滑口。酒店出门就是商业中心，步行至瘦西湖也就10多分钟。,"The first time I stayed in the Jinghua Hotel, I felt that the lobby was very beautiful, and the room was very tidy.Toshiba LCD TV, HBO.Yangzhou Lion's head on the third floor of the hotel is tender and tender.The hotel is a commercial center, and it is more than 10 minutes walking until Shouxi Lake."
1,250的大床房还是蛮实惠的，地段也不错，离最中心地带很近，也很安静！就是感觉房间旧了点,"The 250 large bed room is still very affordable, the location is also good, it is very close to the central area, and it is very quiet!I just feel like the room is old"
0,总体来讲，对登封的印象比较差，基本上是脏乱差的典型！酒店的设施极端简陋，洗手间里连浴帘都没有，洗个澡满屋子的水！而且，没有挂衣服的地方。酒店里的餐厅，竟然不到7点去就已经黑灯瞎火了。总之比较阴暗老旧的酒店，条件很一般。不过，地理位置不错，对面是超市，还有小吃一条街。,"In general, the impression of Dengfeng is relatively poor, and it is basically a typical typical typical!The hotel's facilities are extremely simple, and there is no shower curtain in the bathroom. Take a bath and water!Moreover, there is no place to hang clothes.The restaurant in the hotel was already dark at less than 7 o'clock.In short, it is relatively dark and old -fashioned. The conditions are very general.However, the geographical location is good, opposite is a supermarket, and a street street."
1,"豪华双人间的床很大,一张单人床已经有我在香港住的双人大床那么大,一些细节也挺有意思的,象放在床头的小信封会有一颗糖果和会告诉你明天的天气.就是毛巾有点旧.浴室里也没有可以晾衣服的线.补充点评2007年2月28日：外面有点旧和脏,我们刚到的时候还犹豫着要不要换一家呢,后来看到里面还是不错的,是时候该装修一下外面了","The luxurious double room bed is very large. A single bed is already as big as the double bed I live in Hong Kong, and some details are quite interesting. It will have a candy like a small envelope on the bedside.The weather is a bit old in the towel. There is no line in the bathroom that can dry clothes. Supplementary reviews February 28, 2007: It is a bit old and dirty outside. When we first arrived, we hesitated to change a family. Later, I saw it.It's still good inside, it's time to decorate the outside"
1,"我们从6月21日到6月25日在亚太(二期)一共住了四个晚上,原本想在这个酒店住两天,再到亚龙湾住两天,但我老公觉得这样太累了,所以就没有定其他酒店,现在想想觉得有些后悔.首先,亚太国际会议中心的服务的确不错,差不多每天见到的服务员都能主动与客人打招呼,而且非常亲切(但除了三期中餐厅的收银员,态度较冷淡);宾馆大堂还是比较漂亮的,游泳池也很美,由于我事先再三要求住在五楼,而且一定要100%海景房,所以携程这点也尽量做到了(在此表示感谢),房间比较陈旧,连我不讲究的老公都觉得不太符合五星级的标准,但是厕所是兰色的主题,很干净,很大,我和我儿子都很喜欢.早上起床,我迫不及待地打开厚厚的窗帘,给我的第一感觉就是:美极了!棒极了!这家酒店的早饭一般般,由于我们连住了四天,每天吃的都差不多,品种看上去蛮多的,但味道实在不敢恭维,而且最要命的是除了房间,前台(有一个立式空调)以外,酒店的任何地方都没有空调(连吊扇也没有),我们早上每天都吃得大汗淋淋,热得实在是吃不消.但餐厅环境还是不错的.我们去了一次三期吃饭,感觉环境比二期要好,而且餐厅有中央空调(但那里似乎服务员都不怕热,即使有空调也不开).总的来讲:服务不错,环境不错,离大海沙滩很近,三亚是个很美的地方,我和儿子走的时候都有些依依不舍,但是由于三亚本身是个很热的地方,这个酒店没有空调,太热了,所以下次去的话除非冬季去会住在那里,其余季节不会再住这个酒店了(真是觉得很可惜)","We lived in the Asia -Pacific (second phase) for four nights from June 21 to June 25. We originally wanted to live in this hotel for two days and live in Yalong Bay for two days, but my husband felt so tired, soThere are no other hotels, and now I think it is a bit regrettable. First of all, the service of the Asia -Pacific International Conference Center is indeed good. The waiters who almost see each day can actively say hello to the guests, and very kind (but except for the cashier of the three -phase Chinese restaurant,The attitude is relatively cold); the lobby of the hotel is still more beautiful, and the swimming pool is also beautiful. Since I repeatedly requested to live in the fifth floor in advance, and it must be 100%sea view room, Ctrip also tried to do this (thank you here),The room is relatively old, and even the husband I don't pay attention to does not think it is in line with the five -star standard, but the toilet is the theme of the blue color. It is very clean and very large. My son and I like it very much.The thick curtains, the first feeling given to me is: Mei Ji! Best! This hotel's breakfast is average. Because we live for four days, we eat the same every day. There are quite a lot of varieties.But the taste is really dare not compliment, and the most terrible thing is that except the room, the front desk (with a vertical air conditioner), there is no air conditioner in the hotel anywhere.It's really unbearable. But the restaurant environment is still good. We went to eat in the third phase, and felt that the environment was better than the second phase, and the restaurant had a central air conditioner (but it seemed that the waiters were not afraid of heat, even if there was an air conditioner, it could not be opened). Total.In terms of: the service is good, the environment is good, it is very close to the sea beach. Sanya is a very beautiful place. When I walk with my son, I am a little relieved. HoweverIt's hot, so if you go next time, you will live there unless you will live there in winter, and you will not live in this hotel anymore in the rest of the season (I really think it is a pity)"
1,在太原还算不错的，个人认为要比山西大酒店好！国贸没住过，价格太贵，呵呵,"It's not bad in Taiyuan. I personally think that it is better than the Shanxi Hotel!The international trade has never lived, the price is too expensive, haha"
1,我和老公2月16日入住3天藏式标间，非常喜欢这里，总结优点如下：1、空调非常好，而且整个饭店是在一个类似温室的大环境下的，开窗户后进来得也是暖风，在寒冷的冬季很舒适。2、室内有很大的加湿器，香格里拉冬季干燥，我一般会开一整晚，水都不用添。3、早餐藏、中、西式都有，也很可口。4、晚餐有火锅，99元2个人吃很富裕，而且还是海鲜火锅。5、位置很好，出门总有出租车。6、每天送果蓝：香梨、橘子、桂圆、苹果。7、服务也不错。8、藏式标间有两张床，不过个人认为每张床都有双人床那么大，还有环行沙发，总之两人用有点浪费。,"My husband and I stayed in the Tibetan standard room for 3 days on February 16th. I like it very much. The summary advantages are as follows: 1. The air conditioner is very good, and the entire restaurant is in an environment like a greenhouse.Wind is comfortable in the cold winter.2. There is a large humidifier indoors. Shangri -La is dry in winter. I usually drive all night, and there is no need to add water.3. Breakfast collection, middle and western style, it is also delicious.4. There are hot pot dinner. 2 people who eat 99 yuan are very rich, and they are still seafood hot pot.5. The location is very good. There are always taxis when you go out.6. Send fruit blue every day: fragrant pear, orange, longan, apple.7. The service is also good.8. There are two beds in the Tibetan standard room, but I personally think that each bed is as large as a double bed and a sofa. In short, the two are a bit wasteful."
1,就这个价格来说酒店已经非常好了。不过携程把地址写成以前的路名了，害得我的车载GPS把我往相反方向带了5KM，开到了一片待拆迁的地方，像个鬼街。把一车人都吓得不清。（当时是晚上9点多）。建议取消以前的地名，直接用现在的路名。,"At this price, the hotel is already very good.However, Ctrip wrote the address as the previous road name, which made my car GPS bring me 5km in the opposite direction and opened it to a place to be demolished, like a ghost street.A carrier was so scared.(It was more than 9 o'clock in the evening).It is recommended to cancel the previous place name and use the current road name directly."
0,这个酒店和曲阜都给人留下了永远难忘的印象－－垃圾！！奉劝各位千万不要再去那里了，保你后悔没及！总体印象是：无论酒店，商店，交通还是旅游景点，除了收费已和国际接轨了以外，其他的都是老、少、边区的水平！！！！！！！！悲哀呀，以提倡仁、义、礼、至、信闻名于世的孔老夫子的故乡,"Both this hotel and Qufu have left a unforgettable impression -garbage!IntersectionI advise you not to go there again, keep you regret it!The overall impression is: regardless of hotels, shops, transportation, or tourist attractions, except for the charges that are in line with international standards, the others are all the levels of old, young, and border areas!IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionSad, to promote benevolence, righteousness, courtesy, ritual, and belief in the native of the world."

1,商务房似乎重新装修了，还不错。自助早餐比以前丰盛多了。。。服务生的服务不错,"The business house seems to be renovated, which is not bad.Buffet breakfast is much more abundant than before.EssenceEssenceThe waiter's service is good"
1,房间虽然不大，但很有欧洲风味，很有特色。空调制热效果一般，大床房的被子太小，晚上盖着有点冷。,"Although the room is not large, it is very European and distinctive.The air conditioning heating effect is average. The quilt in the large bed room is too small, and it is a bit cold at night."
1,多次住天荣，天荣一楼的餐厅真的不错，就是宾馆的不太好找，去了一次也就好了,"Living in Tianrong many times, the restaurant on the first floor of Tianrong is really good, but the hotel is not very easy to find."

1,这个酒店设施还可以，早餐也还可以，位于的路段也很方便。我们住的是商务电脑房，房间里配有电脑，上网速度也很快。就是房间很小，电脑台与床很近，打电脑的时候连走路也不能走。浴室是透明，适合情侣和夫妻~~。,"This hotel facilities are okay, breakfast is okay, and the road section is also very convenient.We live in a business computer room. The room is equipped with a computer, and the Internet speed is fast.The room is very small, the computer platform and bed are very close, and even walking when playing the computer, you can't even walk.The bathroom is transparent, suitable for couples and couples ~~."
1,真是不错的酒店，装修风格简洁，明快，尤其是豪华房大气，整洁，洗漱台设计新颖。早餐品种丰富，味道也好，孩子胃口大开。酒店还有一个特色，楼层设置的书吧，在酒店中较为少见，为酒店增添了文化气氛。服务也到位，令人倍感温馨。只是有两个小建议，一，我们房间的双人沙发椅中间凹陷下去，希望能修理或更换。二，电视机有些陈旧，可考虑换成液晶的。总之，喜欢这家酒店，望月办越好。宾馆反馈2008年8月12日：非常感谢您对我们酒店的支持与厚爱！您的意见已与客房部经理反映，下次如遇此类事情可直接与前台或销售部联系（8708）我们会为您及时换房或免费升级其它房型，酒店全体员工期待您的下次光临！！！,"It is really a good hotel. The decoration style is simple, bright, especially the luxurious room atmosphere, clean, and novel design.Breakfast variety is rich and tastes good, and children have a great appetite.There is also a feature of the hotel. Books set up on the floor are relatively rare in the hotel, adding a cultural atmosphere to the hotel.The service is also in place, which is warm.There are only two small suggestions. First, the double sofa chair in our room will be depressed in the middle, hoping to repair or replace it.Second, the TV is a bit old, and you can consider replacing it with LCD.In short, like this hotel, the better the month.Hotel feedback on August 12, 2008: Thank you very much for your support and love for our hotel!Your opinion has reported with the guest room manager that if you encounter such things, you can directly contact the front desk or sales department (8708).

0,这是第一次订这家酒店，酒店位置还可以，但肯定开业已经有一段年月，装修有点旧，办了入住手续，进入房间，感觉房间的状况不好，所以决定亏半天房租，还是另外找其它酒店,"This is the first time to book this hotel. The hotel location is OK, but it must be opened for a while. The decoration is a bit old. After checking in, I enter the room.Also looking for other hotels"
1,总体感觉不错，性价比挺高的，旁边有个银座，银座下面还有个超市,"Overall feels good, the cost -effective is quite high, there is a Ginza next to it, and there is a supermarket under Ginza."
1,"总体还可以,网线接口与桌面距离遥远且怪异,不知道当初设计时是怎么想的,要横夸半个房间;晚上暖气太好了,第一天晚上被热得睡不着,又不能象空调一样可调节;早餐没什么吃的,过于简单,顶多准三星的水平.不过在西宁据说算好的了","Overall, the distance between the network cable interface and the desktop is far away and weird. I do n’t know what I thought when I was designing. I need to exaggerate half of the room; the heating at night is too good, the first night is hot, but I ca n’t be like an air conditioner.It can be adjusted; there is nothing to eat breakfast, too simple, at most the level of Samsung. However, it is said that it is good in Xining"
1,房间比较大，在闹市区出行方便，衣柜装修得古香古色挺休闲让人感觉比较轻松。,"The room is relatively large. It is convenient to travel in the downtown area. The decoration of the wardrobe is old -fashioned and casual, which makes people feel easier."

1,"这次入住发现在服务上下了工夫.比如在走道上,洗手间放了报纸.餐厅早餐自助餐服务,电梯服务都很周到.其实宾馆服务硬件不一定要很豪华,但要真心对待客人.希望坚持.","This time I found that the service was on the service. For example, on the aisle, there were newspapers in the bathroom. The restaurant breakfast buffet service, elevator services are very thoughtful. In fact, hotel service hardware does not have to be luxurious, but you must really treat guests. Hope to persist."
0,距离市区远，因为有接机服务就选择了，司机态度不好，酒店感觉有点老旧，看到房间内有电脑以为设施不错，可问后知道，只要你用就收一正天费用60，狠啊！就算我不睡觉的用也不值啊！综合：不适合背包客或年轻人,"Far away from the urban area, because there is a pick -up service, the driver's attitude is not good.

0,"综述:见过差的四星酒店,没见过这么差的准四星酒店.详细描述:1,基础设施问题:酒店承诺可以宽带上网,但房间经过更换,才可以使用.房间设施比较简陋.和四形标准有一定差距.具体表现在:家具陈旧,没有必要的办公用具.床具不是一般的硬,而且有明显的污渍.2,服务态度问题.到达酒店时,门童没有服务意识,不仅不帮助客人拿行李,而且开门的意识都没有.总机接线员不仅不使用双语,而且连基本的礼貌用语都没有.3,安全保卫方面问题:酒店防火安全意识不够高.首先,酒店房间内的插座和电源按键安装不稳定,部分地方有明显松动的状况.其次,在酒店3--4层的安全出口的过道内铺设了地毯,根据消防法的内容,酒店安全出口的过道内是不能铺设地毯的.保安并不尽职.4,餐饮问题.酒店早餐没有水果,这是我以前住酒店从没遇到的.没有就没有吧,但是,酒店独出心裁,把塑料水果放在餐台上,不知酒店是考察客人的智商还是工作人员失误.以上就是入住此酒店的感受,但此酒店不是一无适处,酒店门口有轻轨,交通还算便利,距机场较近,前台的一位接待人员和电脑工程师值得表扬.如果你不追求享受,如果你可以忍受没有网络的日子,如果你可以对酒店服务质量不做更高要求,如果你可以保证你入住其间,酒店不会发生火灾.我推荐您入住此酒店.","Summary: I have seen the poor four -star hotel, and I have never seen such a poor quasi -four -star hotel.

The bed tools are not generally hard, and there are obvious stains. 2, service attitude issues.Not only does it not help guests get my luggage, but there is no consciousness of opening the door. Not only does the header do not only use bilingual, but there is no basic polite term. 3, safety security issues: hotel fire safety awareness is not high enough. First of all, the hotel room, in the hotel roomThe installation of the socket and the power button is unstable, and there are obvious loose conditions in some places. Secondly, a carpet is laid in the aisle of the safe exit of the hotel 3--4.The carpet. The security guard is not due to due diligence .4, catering problem. There was no fruit for breakfast in the hotel. This was what I had never encountered in the hotel before. No, there was no, but the hotel was ingenious and plastic fruits on the table. I don’t know if I don’t knowIs the hotel's improvisation of the guest's IQ or staff. The above is the feeling of staying in this hotel, but this hotel is not a suitable place. The hotel door is light rail and the traffic is still convenient. It is closer to the airport.Computer engineers are worthy of praise. If you do not pursue enjoyment, if you can tolerate the days without the Internet, if you can do not make higher requirements for the quality of the hotel service, if you can guarantee that you will be in the hotel, the hotel will not have a fire. I recommend youCheck in this hotel."
1,感受的是热情的服务！从入门开始，一直很愉快！房间硬件只是准2星的吧，卫生间淋浴头在马桶上方，没有浴帘，会洒满全房间，塑料拖鞋，早餐按人配好，就是个招待所。在这种情况下，前台服务非常热情，打电话问路，因为路口没有标识，所以没法找到，前台干脆直接出来接！很不错，真正的勤能补拙！我们时间有限，请她推荐路线，很热情，信息也很准确，我们玩得很开心。地点在庐山别墅区内，稍偏，但是环境很好，花岗岩的外墙，站在走廊上看，犹如置身于古堡。建议酒店在入口挂个招牌。,"Feel the enthusiastic service!Starting from getting started, I have been very happy!The hardware of the room is just a quasi -2 star. The bathroom shower head is above the toilet. Without the shower curtain, it will sprinkle the whole room, plastic slippers, and breakfast for breakfast, which is a guest house.In this case, the front desk service is very enthusiastic. I call to ask the way. Because there is no logo at the intersection, I ca n’t find it. The front desk will simply come out directly!Very good, real diligence can make up!We have limited time, please recommend the route, very enthusiastic, the information is very accurate, we have fun.The location is in the Lushan Villa area, but it is slightly different, but the environment is very good. The exterior wall of granite stands on the corridor and looks like being in the ancient castle.It is recommended that the hotel hangs a signboard at the entrance."
0,"房间很差,有浓重的烟和潮气的混合味道.我的所有在房间里穿过的衣服都有浓重的味道,尽管我只住了两晚.床也是又硬又小,卧具也很低档,电视更是老旧不堪,像是十年前型号,而且信号极差.早餐品味很低,像个招待所的风格.餐厅里面黑乎乎的,令人感到很沮丧.其它地方印象不深.总之,这样的酒店挂牌5星实在是让人难以理解.","The room is very poor, with a strong mixed flavor of smoke and tide. All my clothes I wear in the room have a strong taste, although I only lived for two nights. The bed is also hard and small, and the bedding is very low.TV is even more old, like a model ten years ago, and the signal is extremely poor. The taste of breakfast is very low, like a gesture style. The restaurant is dark and frustrated.This hotel is really difficult to understand."
0,房间配置很差，真可惜太仓没有如家和锦江之星，下次不会再入住这家酒店,"The room configuration is very poor. Unfortunately, Taicang has no star and Jinjiang star, and will not stay in this hotel next time"
1,位置不错，房间设施也好。房间窗户稍微小了点，如果能改造成阳台或者飘窗就好了。早餐有点过于简单。性价比一般。浅尝辄止。,"The location is good, and the room facilities are good.The room window is slightly smaller. If it can be transformed into a balcony or bay window.Breakfast is a bit simple.The cost -effective is average.Try to stop."
0,软硬件都不够三星标准，我是凌晨2点多入住的，过道无人指点，房前灯也没有，还是我自己摸索找到的；房内设施陈旧，有霉味，床上用品看上去不清洁，久放水不热，我点了6：15叫早，结果小姐忘了快7点才叫我，第一句是“你大概已经起来了吧”。我在网上订的高标，最低193元，但是宾馆大幅广告“休闲房118，高标168”，鉴于此，我进店就问有无客房，小姐反复问我是否预定，就是不正面回答有无客房。我向宾馆提出房价问题，宾馆一会说是我的房间是高标的，是总统套房的附属间，一会又说促销是针对当地人的。我指出宾馆有促销应当及时与网站沟通，没有沟通应当对网站客人至少按照促销价结算，否则我要提前退房，宾馆又说要给我换一个好的房间。给我的感觉，宾馆缺乏应有的诚信和气度。我提前退房，发现那里有许多报馆，虽然总体条件不能与上海相比，但是价格便宜。,"The software and hardware are not enough for the Samsung standard. I stayed at more than 2 am. No one was in guidance, and there was no front lights in the room. I found it out of the room.It was not hot for a long time. I ordered 6:15 to call early. As a result, the lady forgot to call me almost 7 o'clock. The first sentence was ""You probably got up.""The high standard I booked online is 193 yuan, but the hotel's large advertisement ""Leisure Room 118, high standard 168"". In view of this, I asked if there was a guest room when I entered the store.No rooms.I asked the hotel to ask the house price. The hotel said that my room was a high standard, and it was a subsidiary of the presidential suite. After a while, the promotion was targeted at the locals.I pointed out that the hotel's promotion should communicate with the website in a timely manner. If there is no communication, you should set up at least settlement of the website guests at least according to the promotion price. Otherwise, I have to check out in advance. The hotel said that I would change me to a good room.It feels like me, the hotel lacks the deserved integrity and atmosphere.I checked out in advance and found that there are many newspapers there. Although the overall conditions cannot be compared with Shanghai, the price is cheap."
0,超级恶心的一家宾馆，入住后发现写字台窗台上到处是灰尘，非常恶心，向总台投诉后，才打扫干净！服务非常差，房间也非常差，进去后还有异味，而且床非常不舒服，感觉床单也不干净，个人感觉根本够不上星级！太恶心了，这么破的地方，晚上竟然还有人打骚扰电话，问要不要服务，什么破地方！早餐也非常恶心，根本没什么吃的！！,"A super disgusting hotel, after checking in, found that there was dust on the window sill of the office, very disgusting, and after complaining to the head station, it was cleaned!The service is very poor, the room is very poor, there is a odor after entering, and the bed is very uncomfortable. I feel that the sheets are not clean. I personally feel that it is not enough to the star!It's too disgusting. In such a broken place, there are still people harassing calls at night, asking if they want to serve, what breaks!Breakfast is also very disgusting, there is nothing to eat at all!Intersection"
1,偶住的是南楼的房间，性价比不错！酒店位置很好，离莫家街和清真大寺都很近，走路分别为5分钟，而且附近吃饭的地方很多，有家特色的“益鑫手抓饭”的清真馆，很多回民去吃，马路对面还有家王家拉面很8错。而且还有双早，是在正楼餐厅，还行！唯一不好就是酒店隔音很差，楼道里的说话声音都能听到！,"Occasionally I live in the room in the South Tower, which is good for cost -effective!The hotel location is very good. It is very close to Mojia Street and Halal Temple. Walking is 5 minutes, and there are many places to eat nearby. There are ""Yixin hand -grabbing rice"" halal.On the opposite side, there is also 8 mistakes ramen.And there are dual morning, in the main tower restaurant, it's okay!The only bad is that the hotel's sound insulation is very poor, and the sound of speaking in the corridor can be heard!"
0,为了携程网的声誉，建议将此宾馆从合作名单中剔除。2008年1月28日入住，就发现蟑螂乱跑，不知是否此时正是蟑螂活跃的季节。没有用餐的地方，非常不方便房间太小，走道和床间距只有不足半米。卫生间也很小，热水通过50升的电热器提供，一次只能供一个人洗澡。此宾馆不执行国家法律规定，发票小额中奖，不给即时兑付，而是要将发票留下，兑完奖后再给寄出。增加宾馆和用户双方的成本，不知是何道理。用户提出意见，拒不改正，而且蛮不讲理。声称用户可以随便投诉，无语。服务员个人服务态度尚好，但宾馆整体水平太差。,"For Ctrip's reputation, it is recommended that this hotel eliminates the cooperation list.Checking in January 28, 2008, I found that cockroaches ran around. I wonder if it was the season when cockroaches were active.There is no place for meals. It is very inconvenient to be too small in the room, and the aisle and bed distance are only less than half a meter.The bathroom is also very small. The hot water is provided by 50 liters of electric heater, which can only be used for a bath at a time.This hotel does not implement national laws and regulations. The invoice is a small prize and will not be paid in real time. Instead, the invoice is left, and it will be sent after reaching the prize.Increasing the cost of hotels and users, I don't know how to make it.The user made an opinion, refused to correct it, and was quite unreasonable.Claiming that users can complain casually and speechless.The personal service attitude of the waiter is still good, but the overall level of the hotel is too poor."
0,"外观还行,但是里面的环境就没法提了.卫生间有一股说不清的味道,本来想洗澡,但是看过卫生间后,还是打消了念头!早餐只有面包\粥\咸菜\,以及鸽子蛋大小的鸡蛋.吃完之后居然","The appearance is okay, but the environment inside cannot be mentioned. There is an indescribable taste in the bathroom. I originally wanted to take a bath, but after seeing the bathroom, I still dismissed the idea! Breakfast only includes bread \ porridge \ pickles \, and pigeon eggs, and pigeon eggsEggs of size. After eating"
1,时间安排紧张，在蔽龙阁匆匆住上一宿。但就在5月22日晚入住到23日中午退房之间发生的几件事情不得不提。5月22日由于在阳朔西街吃完东西比较晚了，汽车站里晃了一圈，发现去大榕树的车子都歇了。就在包车去蔽龙阁或者就地在阳朔西街住两个想法之间犹豫的时候，想到网友写过可以和酒店联系确定是否可以来接。抱着试试看的心理，我拨通了酒店的电话。在热情的问候之后，酒店提出解决方案，让老板亲自开车来街。约摸十分钟之后，一辆八成新的普桑停在了面前，闲话少说上车走人。一路上和老板神侃，得知老板自己住在西街，蔽龙阁是他本来想买下和家人同住共享天伦，然而他想把好东西拿出来和大家分享。老板本人也是建筑艺术设计专业出身，这也难怪有眼里买下蔽龙阁。到了酒店之后，果然有了和网友类似的感慨。一丿漂亮的民居，跨过门槛，抬头就见那一窝已经入睡的燕子。负责接待的苏小姐也就是刚才接我电话的那位，热情招待我们，迅速办完入住手续之后，叮嘱我一定要把常住地址写全，还说前几天有个客人过来住，没写地址，后来退房之后东西拉下了，没有办法寄给她。我心里想这个人可粗心，自己绝对不会犯同样的错误。可是后来的事情告诉我过于高估自己了，其实人都差不多。蛙声呱呱，泥土芬芳，一夜好梦。早晨醒来，又一次感慨自己的决策英明，选择这样一个好地方。顾不上洗漱，冲上屋顶平台。COOL，一幅阳朔山水画跃入眼帘；爽，如此惬意的人生。拿出相机，咔嚓咔嚓。本来想在平台上摆放的桌子上吃早餐，后来想太麻烦了。回房间整理洗漱之后，来到院落天井。苏小姐已经将一大碗热腾腾的米粉端到我的面前，还有色香味俱全的“爱爱耙”（用艾草汁浸制的糍粑）。那个酱菜也是值得一提，虽然我吃得不多。早餐之后，骑上苏小姐帮忙借来自行车，由她领着前往“大榕树”。（不过真的是不建议去那里，名不副实。）回到上海之后，发现自己犯了一个和前他人一样的错误--数码相机的充电器和电池拉在店里了。在和酒店通了电话，确认东西还在之后，李阿姨告知老板会帮忙把东西寄过来。后来和老板确认邮寄时间和费用的时候，老板风趣地说，就当广告费了，帮忙网上宣传一下吧。于是就有了我现在的留言。一家之言，谨供参考。,"The time arrangement was tight, and he hurriedly stayed in the dragon pavilion.But just on the evening of May 22, there were several things that happened between check -in at noon on the 23rd.On May 22, because it was relatively late to eat things on Yangshuo West Street, the bus station shook around and found that the cars that went to the big banyan tree were rest.Just when the chartered car was hesitant or lived between two ideas on the West Street in Yangshuo on the spot, I thought that netizens had written to contact the hotel to determine whether they could pick up.With the psychology of trying, I called the hotel's phone.After enthusiastic greetings, the hotel proposed a solution to let the boss drive to the street in person.After about ten minutes, a new Pusan stopped in front of him, and said few gossip and said on the car.Along the way, he and the boss were so strong that he learned that the boss lived in West Street. The dragon pavilion was that he wanted to buy it with his family to share Tianlun, but he wanted to take out good things out to share with you.The boss himself is also born in architectural art design. It is no wonder that there are a dragon pavilion in his eyes.After arriving at the hotel, there was a sense of emotion similar to netizens.A beautiful house, crossing the threshold, looked up and saw the swallow that had fallen asleep.Ms. Su, who is responsible for receiving, is the one who answered me just now. After enthusiastically entertaining us, after quickly finishing the check -in procedures, I told me that I must write the residential address. I also said that a guest came over a few days ago.After checking out, the things were pulled down, and there was no way to send it to her.I thought that this person was careless, and I would never make the same mistake.But what happened later told me that it was too overestimated, but people were almost the same.The frog sounds, the soil is fragrant, a good dream overnight.Wake up in the morning, and once again feels wise in decision -making, choose such a good place.If you don't care about washing, rush to the roof platform.COOL, a picture of Yangshuo's landscape jumping into the eyes; cool, such a comfortable life.Take out the camera and click.I wanted to eat breakfast on the table placed on the platform, but I thought it was too troublesome.After returning to the room to sort out and wash, come to the courtyard patio.Miss Su has brought a large bowl of hot rice noodles to me, as well as ""love rakes"" with all color and fragrances (the ravioli immersed in wormwood juice).That sauce is also worth mentioning, although I don't eat much.After breakfast, ride Ms. Su for helping from borrowing from the bicycle, and she led her to the ""big banyan tree"".(However, it is really not recommended to go there, the name is not true.) After returning to Shanghai, I found that I made a mistake like a former person-the charger and battery of the digital camera was pulled in the store.After passing the phone with the hotel, after confirming that the thing was still there, Aunt Li told the boss to help send things over.Later, when I confirmed the postal time and cost with the boss, the boss said with interest, just be an advertising fee, and help it to promote it online.So I have my message now.The words of the family are for reference."
1,我住的是虹口商务酒店，就在虹口大酒点的对面，相比较起来外观实在落差很大，酒店大堂也小的可怜但是入住之后才发现不错。优点：价格适合年轻人或居家旅行，性价比比较高。卧房和卫生间干净整洁，地理位置紧邻滨海大道（烟台人的骄傲，很漂亮），交通便利，环境很好。缺点：房间隔音比较差，内部设备有些简单陈旧（电视），大堂很小，和对面的虹口大酒店对比落差很大，并且大堂内常有鸡出入，很是不爽。,"I live in Hongkou Business Hotel. It is opposite to Hongkou's big wine. In comparison, the appearance is really a big gap. The hotel lobby is also poor, but I found it well after check -in.Advantages: The price is suitable for young people or home, and the price is higher.The bedroom and bathroom are clean and tidy, and the geographical location is close to the Binhai Avenue (the pride of the Yantai people is very beautiful). The transportation is convenient and the environment is very good.Disadvantages: The room sound insulation is relatively poor, the internal equipment is a bit simple and old (TV), the lobby is very small, and the difference between the opposite Hongkou Hotel is very different, and there are often chickens in the lobby, which is very uncomfortable."
1,"无窗房,价廉物美,晚上8点入住,早上7点出门.对于一些仅仅是睡一觉的客户相当合适.","No rooms, cheap and good quality, live at 8 o'clock in the evening, and go out at 7 in the morning. It is quite suitable for some customers who just sleep."
1,湖景房的景色很不错！酒店里面也收拾的很干净，就是设施稍旧了一些。交通很方便！厦门市的出租车太贵，从酒店到各景点坐公交车都很方便。不过饭店的早餐很一般，选择比较少而且几乎每天都是重复的。,"The scenery of the lake view room is very good!The hotel is also cleaned very clean, that is, the facilities are slightly older.Transportation is very convenient!The taxi in Xiamen is too expensive, and it is very convenient to take a bus from the hotel to various attractions.However, the breakfast of the hotel is very average, and there are fewer choices and duplicate almost every day."
1,房间还不错，卫生还行。只是隔音较差，走廊说话声音直传到房间。,"The room is not bad, and hygiene is okay.It's just that the sound insulation is poor, and the sound of the corridor speaks directly to the room."
1,我订的是高级江景房，就在三层，说实话，真的没什么江景可看！下午开始下大雨，阳台上全是水！那天三层在开会，结果整个三层很浓的烟味！晚上开始有人大声吼卡拉OK，房间还不隔音，好象让我也身在卡拉OK中！而且还有人在叮叮铛铛的装修！打电话到前台，说肯定没有人装修，至于卡拉OK，她们会打电话过去叫声音小一点。过了二十分钟，两种声音如故！打电话给大堂经理，说马上到房间查看。等了半小时，什么人影都没有！来了一个电话，说是装修肯定停了，OK的话尽量叫他们小点声吧。只好自己祈祷吧！谁叫咱是在中国呢，咱消费者才是弱者啊！而且该酒店的交通非常不方便，基本没有出租车，准备乘公交车吧。,"I booked a high -end river view room, just three floors. To be honest, there is really no Jiangjing to see!It started to rain in the afternoon, and the balcony was full of water!On the three floors of the meeting that day, the whole three -layer was strong!At night, someone shouted loudly, and the room was not soundproof, as if I was in the karaoke!And there are people who are decorated with Ding Ding Dang!I called the front desk and said that no one was decorated. As for the karaoke, they would call to call a little less.Twenty minutes, the two sounds are the same!Call the lobby manager and say that you will go to the room immediately to check.After waiting for half an hour, no figure!A call came, saying that the decoration must be stopped, so try to call them a little.Have to pray yourself!Who told us in China, our consumers are the weak!And the hotel's transportation is very inconvenient, and there is basically no taxi. You are going to take a bus."
1,性价比满高的酒店!闹中取静，院内环境幽静，怀旧的感觉，如同对西安的感觉。也可以选择院内其他酒店的配套消费。离钟鼓楼很近，也满安全的。房间内，设施具全，选择颜色和设计，体现法国人浪漫和温馨的情调。例如，浴室淋浴房和卧室用玻璃隔开的。唯一不足的是，房间之间的隔音比较差。。。还是满只得推荐的。。。,"The cost -effective hotel! Take quiet in the trouble, the environment in the courtyard is quiet, and the feeling of nostalgia is like the feeling of Xi'an.You can also choose the supporting consumption of other hotels in the hospital.It is very close to the bell and drum tower.In the room, the facilities are full, and the color and design are selected to reflect the romantic and warm mood of the French.For example, the bathroom shower room is separated from glass in the bedroom.The only disadvantage is that the sound insulation between the rooms is relatively poor.EssenceEssenceIt is still recommended.EssenceEssence"
1,房间很干净的，住的朝南的房间，太阳照进来很舒服，现在可以上网了，网速也不错的说。宾馆的交通老方便，闹中取静的地方。月坛北街上的护国寺小吃我也老喜欢的。宾馆里提供10元的午餐和晚餐也不错。缺点么，就是隔音不是很好。总的来说，还是不错的，生意也不错。,"The room is very clean. The sun in the south of the room is very comfortable in the sun. Now it can be surfed, and the speed of the Internet is also good.The hotel's transportation is old and convenient, and the place where you are quiet.I always like the Huoluo Temple snacks on the north street of Yuenan.The hotel offers 10 yuan for lunch and dinner.The disadvantage is that the sound insulation is not very good.Overall, it is still good, and the business is good."
1,尽管这家酒店离市中心有点距离，但风景及服务特别好，酒店设施齐全，步行就能到海边，酒店也能为你联系司机并将早饭提前送到房间，不另外收取费用。酒店的餐饮口味也能基本上满足各种要求，下次来威海还住这家酒店。,"Although this hotel is a bit far from the city center, the landscape and service are particularly good. The hotel facilities are complete, and you can go to the sea by walking. The hotel can contact the driver for you and send breakfast to the room in advance without any additional fees.The food taste of the hotel can basically meet various requirements. Next time, I will stay in Weihai to stay in this hotel."
1,总体感觉还不错，绝对不至于影响到旅游的心情。住的是后面的小楼的一楼，环境不错，花园一样，游泳池是露天的，能够看到一直有人在清洁。如果晚上阳台的窗户不关，前台会打电话到房间提醒客人注意安全。补充点评2007年9月20日：另外，去的时候提前联系会有接机，我们返回的时候由于有老人，所以和客房部联系了一下，也安排了车送我们去机场的。不足的是房间设施比较一般，早餐很素。,"Overall feels good, and it will never affect the mood of travel.I live in the first floor of the small building behind. The environment is good. Like the garden, the swimming pool is open -air. I can see that someone has always been cleaning.If the window of the balcony at night is not closed, the front desk will call the room to remind guests to pay attention to safety.Supplementary comment on September 20, 2007: In addition, when we go, contact will be connected in advance. When we return, because there are elderly people, we contacted the guest room department and arranged for us to take us to the airport.The lack is that the room facilities are relatively average and breakfast is very plain."
1,环境不错，房间很干净。服务人员素质很好，态度很不错，结帐时很快。如果宾馆的人员能看到这个的话，建议餐卷可以重新印一下，早餐的时候我是被误导到4楼去了的。有点不爽。,"The environment is good and the room is very clean.The quality of the service personnel is very good, the attitude is very good, and the checkout is fast.If the hotel staff can see this, it is recommended that the meal can be printed again. I was misleaded on the 4th floor during breakfast.A little uncomfortable."
1,预订的时候，要求“正朝中山公园的行政楼层”；以前介绍去的朋友都是这么订，有的还住了超过2个礼拜。但是，这次通过携程预定的时候，就是只能说“尽量安排”，不能直接确认，有点失望！房间设施不错，但是偏小，白天的风景很不错；34楼的行政酒廊，全免费，非常的划算！,"When booking, it is required to ""be in the administrative floor of Zhongshan Park""; friends who introduced them before were so booked, and some also lived for more than 2 weeks.However, this time when I booked through Ctrip, I can only say that ""try to arrange"". It cannot be confirmed directly. It is a bit disappointed!The room facilities are good, but the scenery is small, and the scenery during the day is very good; the administrative wine corridor on the 34th floor is free and very cost -effective!"
1,具备4星级宾馆标准，但入住当日因故停电、停水，住了3天，热水停了1天半。环境很好，服务满意,"With the standard of 4 -star hotels, but because of the power outage and water discontinuation due to the day of staying, it took 3 days and the hot water stopped for 1 and a half days.The environment is very good, the service is satisfied"
1,强烈推荐！服务非常到位的一家酒店！比很多四星级的酒店服务要好。九点设施比较新，而且设计也很人性化。就在皮革城的对面。如果是到海宁选购皮衣，住在这里是最好的选择。我给家人买的皮衣尺码不合适，还是酒店一位姓敬的前台工作人员帮助我调换并给我寄回北京，很感动，真的是感觉宾至如归。,"highly recommended!A hotel with a very good service!It is better than many four -star hotel services.Nine -point facilities are relatively new, and the design is also very user -friendly.Just opposite the leather city.If you go to Haining to buy leather clothes, living here is the best choice.The size of the leather coat I bought for my family is inappropriate, or a front desk staff of the hotel's surname to help me exchange and send me back to Beijing. It is very moved. It really feels like a guest."
1,厨卫配备是实在可用的。地理位置不错，在深圳西边新城区，门口附近的便利店、卤水店挺方便。就是房间内装，虽明显优于一般的酒店式公寓，但相对于号称的五星级，还是略显简单、不够大气。,"The kitchen and bathroom equipment is really available.The geographical location is good. In the new city of the west of Shenzhen, the convenience stores and brine near the door are convenient.It is the interior of the room, although it is obviously better than ordinary hotel -style apartments, but compared to the known five -star, it is still slightly simple and not atmospheric."
0,酒店离开市区挺远，很不方便。除了大堂气派，房间根本没有五星，充其量较差的四星，更莫名其妙的是房间竟然没有暖空调，下次决不考虑入住。,"The hotel is far away from the city, which is very inconvenient.Except for the lobby style, the room has no five -star at all. At best, it is even more inexplicable that the room does not have a warm air conditioner. I will never consider staying next time."
1,在衢州能住到这样的酒店算是很不错了，房间液晶电视，窗口看出去是条小河，还送了水果，算是很不错的啦，就是周围环境一般，没什么可以逛的...,"It is very good to be able to stay in such a hotel in Luzhou. The LCD TV in the room, the window sees that it is a small river, and the fruit is also sent."
1,所谓山景房，就是非海景房而已，没有什么山景可言，海景房确实有景，有条件尽量选。只是这种房的窗帘边上拉不严，早上光线进来如同亮着灯一般，可能引发早醒。另外窗外隔音不佳，如果风大则呼呼响得明显，这想必也必不了了。,"The so -called mountain view room is just a non -sea view room. There is no mountain scenery at all. The sea view room does have scenery. Try to choose as possible.It's just that the curtains of this kind of room are not strictly pulled. The light in the morning is like a light, which may cause early wake up.In addition, the sound insulation outside the window is not good."
1,"酒店整体还不错,豪华套房整体的感觉是客厅稍大了些,卧房小了些.其余都还可以.","The overall hotel is not bad. The overall feeling of the luxury suite is that the living room is slightly larger, and the bedroom is smaller. The rest is okay."
1,除了隔音差点、房间小点、没有毛巾，其他都不错，而且出行太方便了，无论是购物还是办事都很方便。,"Except for sound insulation, small rooms, no towels, everything else is good, and travel is too convenient. It is very convenient for shopping or doing things."
1,"已经多次给客户订这个酒店了,这次是自己第一次去.房间非常好,虽然只是标准大床房,房间也不大,但是设施齐全,很舒服,干净整洁.唯一不太满意的是房间的暖气太热了,尽管我已关闭了房间内的中央空调的开关,但温度还是很高,看来这个开关不能控制房间的温度.自助早餐比较一般,不是很丰盛.希望房价能包含早餐.","I have booked this hotel many times many times, this time I went to the first time. The room was very good. Although it was only a standard large bed room, the room was not large, but the facilities were complete, very comfortable, clean and tidy.The heating of the room is too hot. Although I have turned off the central air -conditioning switch in the room, the temperature is still very high. It seems that this switch cannot control the temperature of the room.breakfast."
1,入住的是80公社标准间，很有特色。交通很便利。唯一不太好的是看不到服务员，打电话叫的话要连续几次才有人出现。,"The 80 commune standard room is very distinctive.Transportation is convenient.The only thing that is not very good is that you can't see the waiter. If you call the call, you need to appear several times in a row."
1,干净，房间也够大，缺点是厕所太小，特别是大床间，几乎不能转身。不过对于这个价格的宾馆而言还是很超值的。,"Clean, the room is large enough. The disadvantage is that the toilet is too small, especially in the large bed, and it can hardly turn around.However, it is still very good for this hotel."
1,地理位置不错，，但是有点旧，，不是节假日基本上不用预定，价格到前台订都一样。,"The geographical location is good, but it is a bit old. It is not basically no booking on holidays. The price is the same to the front desk."
1,第二天住的豪华间还比较不错，比第一天的豪华间好多了。酒店离市中心很近，总体来说还是比较方便的。只是感觉价格在徐州来说算是比较贵的了。,"The luxury room lived the next day is still good, much better than the luxury between the first day.The hotel is very close to the city center, and it is generally more convenient.It just feels that the price is more expensive in Xuzhou."
1,不错，推荐！周边环境有点冷清。去机场方便。硬件不错。,"Not bad, recommend!The surrounding environment is a bit deserted.It is convenient to go to the airport.Good hardware."
0,我是经常出差的人，这家饭店的服务如此之烂，是长久以来没有见到过的。承诺宽带上网，一住进去就不通，打电话很多次，好不容易才解决。前台服务很不专业！我太太打电话进来，感觉不是打到饭店，还以为大错了。我找前台要一把剪刀，竟然答复我前台“只有我一个人，无法给您送”。早餐其实不必去吃了，根本没有什么能吃的东西。整个饭店都让人感觉极不专业，竟然还要438！唯独早餐的男服务生，态度还不错。总之，以后不会再住了！,"I am a frequent business. The service of this restaurant has not seen it for a long time.It is promised that the broadband is online. As soon as I live in, I do n’t know it. I call many times and finally solve it.The front desk service is unprofessional!My wife called in and felt that she didn't hit the restaurant, and thought it was wrong.I asked the front desk for a scissors, but I answered my front desk ""I was the only one, I couldn't give it to you.""There is no need to eat breakfast, there is nothing to eat at all.The whole restaurant makes people feel very unprofessional, and it costs 438!The only male waiter with breakfast has a good attitude.In short, I won't live again in the future!"
1,地段还不错，周边饭店也挺多。房间还行，就是洗手间实在是有点寒酸。服务生很热情就是不太专业。比起蛇口的那家似乎差些。,"The location is not bad, and there are a lot of surrounding restaurants.The room is okay, that is, the toilet is a bit shabby.The waiter is very enthusiastic, but it is not very professional.It seems worse than that of Shekou."
1,10月5日入住，宾馆环境不错，服务很好，房间蛮大的，很干净。卫生间隔音效果不是很好，有滴水的声音。宾馆依水而建，池塘和游泳池错落有致，名副其实的水庐，还好这个季节蚊子不多了：）院子里可以停车，距离天目湖景区大门约1公里，可以沿湖散步过去，约一刻钟。,"Check in on October 5th, the hotel environment is good, the service is good, the room is quite large, and very clean.The sound insulation effect of the bathroom is not very good, there is a sound of dripping.The hotel is built according to the water. The pond and the swimming pool are wrong. The authentic water Lu, fortunately, there are not many mosquitoes this season :) The yard can be parked, about 1 kilometer from the gate of Tianmu Lake Scenic Area. You can take a walk along the lake.Essence"
1,房间很大，两个房间，但总体感觉价格上比较贵了点，性价比不高。,"The room is very large, two rooms, but the overall price is a bit expensive, and the price is not high."
0,07年曾经住过一次，感觉还可以。这次感觉不好，被子、床单太、太、太旧了，早该换新的了。其他服务业都一般。,"I lived once in 2007, and I felt okay.It feels bad this time. The quilt, bed sheet is too, too old, and too old. It should have changed.Other service industries are average."
0,一个字：差！招待所的水平，地毯很葬，卫生间很陈旧。补充点评2007年9月12日：离三孔有一段距离，有停车位。号称其装修和布置是儒家风格，但本人无论如何也没有看出来。据说曲阜的宾馆都是如此水平。,"One word: bad!The level of the guest house is very buried, and the bathroom is very old.Supplementary comment on September 12, 2007: There is a distance from San Kong, there is a parking space.It is claimed to be the Confucian style, but I didn't see it anyway.It is said that Qufu's hotels are so level."
0,硬件还算过得去。就是服务水准太差了。前台服务员好像都是煞笔，一个个装傻充愣，一问三不知！！另外，日式标间里根本没有宽带接入，与他们网站上宣传的不符。如果用电话线接入，还要另收费！！为此与前台交涉，服务员和领班态度蛮横，出言不逊！！根本不懂什么叫服务业！！我看这样的服务迟早要让这个度假村关了张！！！,"The hardware is too much.The service level is too poor.The waiters at the front desk seem to be full of strokes, one by one pretending to be stupid, and ask three asks!IntersectionIn addition, there is no broadband access in the Japanese standard room, which is inconsistent with the publicity on their website.If you can access it with a telephone line, you need to charge it separately!IntersectionTo negotiate with the front desk, the waiter and the foreman's attitude are quite horizontal, and they speak well!IntersectionDon't understand what service industry is!IntersectionI see that sooner or later, this service will be closed!IntersectionIntersection"
1,开始通过携程预定的是普通标准大床房，地毯脏，床太小，较差！后来加１００元生到行政间，还可以！比较干净．酒店服务总体还可以．值得一住．,"Starting through Ctrip is the ordinary standard large bed room, the carpet is dirty, the bed is too small, and the worse!Later, if you add 100 yuan to the administration, it is okay!Clean.The hotel service is generally okay.It is worth living."
1,"清明节入住两天.从进入酒店就感受到无处不在的服务,非常周到,又很得体.从大堂,商务中心,到前台,拉丁餐厅(早餐).我在前台checkout时,那个商务中心遇到的小伙子会很殷勤的问要不要出租.步出大堂,好像没有车啊?一瞬间,看到酒店工作人员已经催促备好的出租开过来,一切让我感到轻松自在,备受关怀.服务水准在5星之上.","Two days in Qingming Festival. From entering the hotel, I feel ubiquitous services, very thoughtful, and very decent. From the lobby, business center, to the front desk, Latin restaurant (breakfast).The young man who arrives will be very attentive to ask if you want to rent out. Step out of the lobby, it seems that there is no car? In a moment, seeing that the hotel staff had urged the lease to open it, everything made me feel relaxed and cared for.The level is above 5 stars."
1,1.酒店承诺接机，飞机本来应该在晚上10：00到，但是因为稍晚再加取行李，10：30分才出来，酒店的服务生已经在出口举牌等了，虽然只有我一个人，但仍很热心，态度很好的送我回了酒店。很感谢！（酒店在市中心，机场离市区蛮远，酒店的接机真的很方便。）2.酒店楼很高（比想象的），价格合理，很干净不知道官方是怎么评级的，个人觉得是不错的3星补充点评2008年6月23日：:-)已经1个多月了，想起来还是觉得酒店不错看来以后如果我机会再去HHHT，肯定还会住这里的,"1. The hotel promises to pick up the plane. The plane should have arrived at 10:00 pm, but because the luggage is added later, it comes out at 10:30., But still very enthusiastic, I took me back to the hotel with a good attitude.really thankful!(The hotel is in the city center, the airport is quite far from the city, and the hotel's pick -up is really convenient.) 2. The hotel building is very high (than imagined). The price is reasonable.It is a good 3-star supplement comment on June 23, 2008: :-) It has been more than a month. I still think that the hotel is good. If I have the opportunity to go to HHHT again, I will definitely live here"
1,优点：位置好找，就在安贞桥东南角，入住15楼2房2厅，设施不错，3个电视，家具比较新，空间够大，户内应该有100平米以上，正式的公寓布局，有厨房微波炉，大冰箱，如果一家人度假长住最合适不过了，象家里一样。楼下的餐厅提供家常北京菜，不贵，量足。缺点：看不到鸟巢，要很好的眼神才能看到一个鸟巢肩膀，走路去也不近。离地铁站真的有500米，要走10多分钟，抱着孩子带着行李的还是打车好。卫生间设施有点旧，公卫淋浴排水不好，一洗就水漫金山。不好也不坏：服务态度很有北京特色，够客气也够拖拉，官气足，谁让人家是首都呢。,"Advantages: The location is easy to find, just in the southeast corner of Anzhen Bridge, staying in the 2 room and 2 rooms on the 15th floor, the facilities are good, 3 TVs, the furniture is relatively new, the space is large enough, there should be more than 100 square meters in the room.There are kitchen microwave ovens, large refrigerators. If the family lives on vacation, it is most suitable, just like the family.The restaurant downstairs provides home -cooked Beijing cuisine. It is not expensive and sufficient.Disadvantages: You can't see the bird's nest, you must see a good look to see a bird's nest shoulder, and it is not close to walking.It is really 500 meters away from the subway station. It takes more than 10 minutes to take a taxi with the child with luggage.The bathroom facilities are a bit old. The public and health shower is not well drained.Not good or bad: the service attitude is very characteristic, polite enough to drag."
1,"在自贡这样的二级城市,标准算是相当高的酒店了,说是4星酒店勉强了点,但比很多3星的好.房间灯光太暗,所有灯开了都感觉昏昏沉沉的,不知道是为了省电还是什么,舍不得用大点瓦数的灯泡.我晚上9点到的,点了份炒饭和青椒肉丝,送餐速度挺快,只是花椒多了点.","In a second -level city like Zigong, the standard is a very high hotel. It is said that the 4 -star hotel is barely, but it is better than many 3 stars. The room lights are too dark.Knowing what is for power saving or what, I am reluctant to use a large brick bulb. I arrived at 9 o'clock in the evening. I ordered fried rice and green pepper shreds."
1,去住了四晚，总体感觉不错，首先位置好，离油麻地地铁B2出口很近，步行最多三分钟。其次服务好，我说的普通话，没发现有什么歧视之类的，有天我们不打算打扫房间，估计是主管之类的还专门跑到房间来敲门问一会还需要打扫卫生吗；打扫卫生的阿姨也很热情，对我们说早上好；门卫也热情，对我们微笑，害得我妈高兴一天：）。第三房间比想象的好，不算太小，但很干净，也很安静，先前还说住重庆大厦，后来去看了下完全要不得，幸亏没去。第四价格还不错吧，在携程定的，四晚2266元，押金500元。下次去还住那里吧：））,"I went to live for four nights. The overall feels good. First of all, the location is good. The exit of the B2 from the Oil Maidi Metro is very close, and walking for a maximum of three minutes.Secondly, the service is good. I did n’t find any discrimination or the like in Mandarin. One day we did n’t plan to clean the room. It is estimated that it ’s the supervisor and the like.The sanitary aunt is also very enthusiastic, saying to us good in the morning; the door guard is also enthusiastic, smiling at us, making my mother happy for a day :).The third room is better than expected. It is not too small, but it is very clean and quiet. I also said that living in Chongqing Building before. Later, I went to see it completely. Fortunately, I didn't go.The fourth price is not bad. In Ctrip, it is 2266 yuan for four nights, and the deposit is 500 yuan.Let's live there next time :))"
1,房间很宽敞，大床实在是很大，两个大人带个小孩睡着一点儿也不挤，打扫也很干净。站在海景房的阳台上任海风拂面真是很惬意。早餐内容也很丰富，不过性价比不高。但除此之外，就不能要求更多。送餐的食物实在是有失水准，晚上的露天烧烤除了暴贵之外，没留下其它印象。,"The room was very spacious, and the big bed was really large. The two adults took a child to fall asleep and did not squeeze, and the cleaning was clean.It is really pleasant to stand on the balcony standing on the sea view room.Breakfast content is also very rich, but the cost performance is not high.But in addition, you cannot ask more.The food for meals is really losing. The open -air barbecue at night did not leave other impressions except for being expensive."
1,我住的是杜月笙的别墅，不大，只有7间客房。服务非常温馨，给我一种家的感觉。房间很舒服。周边的环境一流。唯一的缺憾是没有停车的地方。最近的停车地点要步行10分钟。值得再去一次。,"I live in Du Yuesheng's villa, not big, only 7 rooms.The service is very warm, giving me a feeling of home.The room is very comfortable.The surrounding environment is first -rate.The only regret is where there is no parking.The nearest parking location is to walk for 10 minutes.It is worth going again."
1,"不算等候时间,CHECKIN速度算快的.但是现在正是旺季,我等了至少10分钟,还得吸着2手烟等,靠!房间不错,反正各方面感觉挺舒服.宽带迅雷下载1.3MB/S,呆掉了.送报纸,水果,好.VIEW好,特别是湖景房,不用去坐什么鸟船看湖了,我1天在房间里看腻了都.软服务不行,特别是餐厅服务员,完全没有5星饭店的水准,送餐的菜口味只能说很一般了,但服务费却要30%.早餐品种较丰富,但口味算糟糕的,好象是用的原料有问题,水果都淡而无味,连红薯都淡而无味,佩服他们的采购部,不容易啊,能弄到这么价廉物差的东西!!","Not waiting for the waiting time, Checkin is fast. But now it is the peak season. I waited for at least 10 minutes, and I had to suck 2 hand smokes, etc., relying! The room is good, anyway, it feels very comfortable in all aspects. Broadband Thunder download 1.3MB/S, stay away. Send newspapers, fruits, good .View, especially lake view rooms. You don't have to take any bird boat to watch the lake. I am tired of watching it in the room for 1 day.The waiter, there is no level of 5 -star restaurant at all. The taste of the food delivery can only be said to be very general, but the service fee is 30%. The breakfast variety is rich, but the taste is bad, it seems that there is a problem with the raw materials.The fruits are light and tasteless, and even sweet potatoes are light and tasteless. It is not easy to admire their procurement department."
1,楼梯有一个妈妈桑在拉客。。。没感觉酒店中规中矩，早餐还不错。。没什么深刻印象,"The stairs have a mother, Sang is pulling a guest.EssenceEssenceI didn't feel the hotel is quite satisfactory, and the breakfast is not bad.EssenceNothing deeply"
1,房间比较大，服务不错。早餐东西少，卫生间马桶经常堵，报修后反应比较快。,"The room is relatively large and the service is good.Breakfast is small, the toilet toilet is often blocked, and the response is relatively fast after reporting."
0,"1.客房服务态度较好2.早餐还算不错.3.就是房间的灯光,太不满意~~","1. The service attitude of the rooms is better 2. Breakfast is pretty good .3. That is the light in the room, too dissatisfied ~~"
1,已经住过很多次了，几乎每次来东莞都来宏远，房间很宽敞，布置也很好,"I have lived many times, almost every time I come to Dongguan, I come to Hongyuan, the room is very spacious, and the layout is also very good."
1,元旦住的，被升级到豪华美居，两边都不错，瑕疵是两边的洗手间顶都不吸水，如果水温高洗澡时间长一点的话的水蒸汽会滴到头上的啊。两边下水都慢~~,"Living on New Year's Day, it was upgraded to luxurious and beautiful, and both sides were good. The flaws were not absorbing water on both sides. If the water temperature was a little longer, the water steam would drip on the head.The water on both sides is slow ~~"
1,这次回国在上海的邦臣万源酒店入住，总体感觉还不错。服务质量不错，房间很干净，设施也算齐全。江景套房的布局很合理，卧室的用具很干净。缺点是空调声音有些大，而且不能开窗。时间长了房间的空气就有些难以忍受。另外，厨房的灶具多半是摆设，没有实用性。,"This time I returned to China to stay at the Bangchen Wanyuan Hotel in Shanghai, and the overall feeling is not bad.The quality of the service is good, the room is clean, and the facilities are complete.The layout of the Jiangjing suit is very reasonable, and the bedroom utensils are clean.The disadvantage is that the sound of air conditioning is a bit loud and cannot be opened.After a long time, the air of the room is a bit unbearable.In addition, most of the kitchen stoves are furnishings and are not practical."
1,"性价比很好,设施很方便,适合家庭(3人以上)入住宾馆反馈2008年8月5日：非常感谢您的评价。欢迎您和家人一起光临！","The price is good, the facilities are very convenient, suitable for family (more than 3 people) to stay in the hotel feedback on August 5, 2008: Thank you very much for your evaluation.Welcome to come with your family!"
0,"说实在的,一直在协程定房,一直觉得很方便,但是这次这儿的房间简直无法住人,就算粘着会展中心的边,也不是这样糊弄人的.如果你有车,还是住市区,开车来会场也方便.我们之前就是住在徐家汇,开车来的.结果一进房门:墙体斑驳,窗户漏风,走上去咚咚作响(是铁板地),就象是个工棚.晚上的房间很冷,空调开30度也没用!如果你没车.就选地铁旁入住,也方便.总之来上海浦东千万别住这里就是!!","To be honest, I have been setting up the house and always felt very convenient, but this time the room here is simply unable to live. Even if the side of the convention center is stuck, it is not so foolish. If you have a car, you still live in the urban area and drive.The venue is also convenient. We used to live in Xujiahui before and drove. As a result, when the door was entered: the wall was mottled, the windows leaked, and we went up to make a noise (it is an iron plate), as if it was a shed.Cold, the air conditioner is useless to drive 30 degrees! If you do n’t have a car, you choose to stay next to the subway, it is also convenient. In short, do n’t live here in Shanghai Pudong !!"
0,第三次入住该酒店，以前的经历都还可以，所以一直都选择该酒店，不过这次遇到了不能刷卡，感觉是酒店为了节约手续费故意的，幸好现金有结余，不然真的很麻烦，下回不想住了。,"I stayed at the hotel for the third time, and my previous experience was OK, so I always chose the hotel, but this time I encountered it that I couldn't swipe the card. It felt like the hotel was intentionally settled in cash.I don't want to live next time."
1,"位置好,去莫家街\华联\大十字等都非常方便,服务卫生不错,自助早餐丰盛,经济间稍小,性价比高.","The location is good. It is very convenient to go to Mojia Street \ Huarian \ large cross, etc., good service hygiene, buffet breakfast is rich, the economy is slightly smaller, and cost -effective."
1,"我已经是三年第三次通过携程预订这间酒店了,这次有些失望,酒店的服务态度还是很好,无可挑剔,可是现在的酒店设施开始陈旧,房间/卫生间,床等已经掩盖不了陈旧的痕迹,还有难闻的臭味,据说现在老板的注意力已经转移到发展华蓥山酒店了,但是,我觉得不管如何,你们的品牌还是要注意保持.还要就是餐厅,大堂播放的背景音乐,还是80年代的电子琴流行音乐,实在没有品位档次.总之,这次我对服务满意/对酒店设施不满意.","I have booked this hotel for the third time in three years. This time I was a little disappointed. The hotel's service attitude is still very good and impeccable. However, the current hotel facilities have begun to be old.Old traces and unpleasant smells. It is said that the boss's attention has now been transferred to the development of Huapuishan Hotel, but I think no matter what, your brand should pay attention to maintaining it.The background music, or the e -piano pop music in the 1980s, has no grade. In short, I am satisfied with service/dissatisfaction with hotel facilities."
1,"我们入住的是家庭房,外部靠山路,本担心会吵,入住后发现窗户隔音还不错,内部环境尚可,早餐一般.卫生间的淋浴出入量挺大,沐浴感受不错.如果连续两天均要去海边,建议住在连岛内.","We stayed in the family room, the outer mountain road. I was worried that we would make noisy. After staying, I found that the windows of the windows are not bad. The internal environment is acceptable. The breakfast is normal.Going to the sea, it is recommended to live on the island."
1,交通很方便，房间小了一点，但是干净整洁，很有香港的特色，性价比较高，推荐一下哦,"The transportation is very convenient, the room is a little smaller, but it is clean and tidy."
0,酒店所处位置不错，比较安静。房间也比较大，装修及卫生就此价格来说还尚可。但是房间及走廊都有油烟味！估计与楼下永和豆浆的烟道没有分开，虽然气味不是很浓烈，但还是让人感觉时刻处身于厨房，感觉不好。如果有可能，强烈建议重新设置楼下酒店的烟道~~否则下次不考虑入住此酒店了,"The hotel is located well and relatively quiet.The room is also relatively large, and the price of decoration and hygiene is still available.But the room and the corridor have oil fume flavor!It is estimated that it is not separated from the flue of Yongyong and soy milk downstairs. Although the smell is not very strong, it still makes people feel that they are always in the kitchen at all times, and it feels bad.If it is possible, it is strongly recommended to set up the flue of the hotel downstairs ~~ Otherwise, I will not consider staying in this hotel next time"
1,离开该酒店差不多一个月了，但还是想说几句：到达时已经很晚，就在店内的餐厅吃晚饭，其间顺便问第二天能否在五点钟吃上早饭，服务员客气地告诉我虽然餐厅那时还没开门，但她们可以安排送餐到房间。第二天早上五点三十五分，丰盛的早餐果然送到房间，还道歉晚了五分钟。我真得很感动！虽然只是短短的一晚，可以清楚地感到店家的工作人员在用心去工作！鼓励一下！,"I have been away from the hotel for almost a month, but I still want to say a few words: it was very late when I arrived. I had dinner in the restaurant in the store. By the way, I asked if I could eat breakfast at five o'clock the next day.Although the restaurant had not opened the door at that time, they could arrange food delivery to the room.At 5.35 the next morning, the rich breakfast was sent to the room, and apologized for five minutes late.I'm really moved!Although it was just one night, you can clearly feel that the staff of the store is working hard!Encourage it!"
0,预定的时候注明了要二楼房间，入住时是一楼，网上说加一份早餐10元，实际收15元。住酒店还要交停车费10元。豪华单间房间的地毯湿呼呼的，我真是无语了。但酒店大环境是不错，可惜这环境了,"It was indicated that the room on the second floor was specified. It was the first floor when you stayed. It said on the Internet to add a breakfast 10 yuan and the actual collection of 15 yuan.You have to pay a parking fee of 10 yuan.I am really speechless.But the hotel's environment is good, but unfortunately this environment"
1,很好的酒店，强烈推荐．只是服务员打扫房间有点太勤快了．我刚出门几分钟，也没要求打扫，她们就自己进去打扫了．不过，还是不会影响我对这家酒店的好印象。,"Very good hotel, highly recommended.It's just that the waiter's cleaning room is a bit too diligent.I just went out for a few minutes and did not ask for cleaning, they went in and cleaned.However, it will not affect my good impression of this hotel."
1,最物有所值的就是海景房的无敌海景了！房间一面墙的玻璃窗，维多利亚湾的美景一网打尽、一览无余。酒店服务也不错，很热情、贴心，没感到以前听说的对内宾的歧视。我们是上午11时到店的，按规定下午14时后才能入住，原本打算先寄存行李下午再入住，但前台的工作人员主动为我们提前安排了房间并一直陪同我们到客房安顿。要说不足的话，就是餐厅和客户服务员的普通话水平应该进一步提高，以免内宾不得不用英语来表达。另外中宾房的开关等建议增加中文标识。,"The most valuable thing is the invincible sea view of the sea view room!On the glass window on the wall of the room, the beauty of the Gulf of Victoria is full of views.The hotel service is also good, very enthusiastic and intimate, I did not feel discriminatory against the guests that I heard before.We arrived at the store at 11 am. We can only stay after 14 pm. Originally, we planned to store luggage first before staying in the afternoon, but the staff at the front desk took the initiative to arrange the room for us in advance and accompany us to the room.If it is not enough, the level of Mandarin of the restaurant and customer waiters should be further improved, so as not to express English in English.In addition, the switch of Zhongbin House is recommended to add Chinese logo."
1,房间真的很不错，非常干净，特别是床大，睡得很舒服，就是隔音差了点，外面一点点声音里面听得清清楚楚，有点吵。总的来说性价比还是比较高的。,"The room is really good, very clean, especially the bed is large, sleeping comfortably, that is, the sound insulation is a bit worse, and the sound outside the sound is clearly heard in the sound, and it is a bit noisy.In general, cost -effectiveness is relatively high."
0,"房间象80年代的路边小旅馆.通往3楼餐厅的路上,污水横流,黑色的污渍随处可见.房间连电吹风都没有!也没有免费的矿泉水和茶叶包!电脑桌下面的地毯上黑色的污渍到处都是!!更好笑的是,有时打51(前台)后得到的回复是你找52(客房部);然后52又说你找51!!整体而言,还是国企的做法.","The room is like a small roadside hotel in the 1980s. On the road to the 3rd floor, sewage flows, and black stains can be seen everywhere. There is no hair dryer in the room! There is no free mineral water and tea bag!Black stains are everywhere !! What is even more funny is that sometimes the reply after 51 (front desk) is you looking for 52 (guest room); then 52 says that you find 51 !! Overall, the practice of state -owned enterprises."
1,环境安静，空气好，交通也还算方便，但是房间旧了点，早上自助餐一般,"The environment is quiet, the air is good, and the transportation is pretty convenient, but the room is a bit old. The buffet in the morning is generally"
0,请大家千万不要再入住这个酒店了，不是CTRIP不好。是此酒店太烂。一条路上有三个马哥孛罗酒店，其中马哥孛罗港湾应该最好，马哥孛罗太子其次，马哥孛罗香港最差。至少是上个世纪90年代的装修了，非常差。房间很小，两张床并排放。隔音效果也不好。而且酒店后面有个工地，一天都在施工，吵得要命。入住时，持双币信用卡，前台问都不问一句，直接刷美元，而不是RMB。其它香港的商家或酒店在刷信用卡时至少都会问一句刷美元还是RMB？就这样装B。NND。太差了。免费我以后都不会住了！！！,"Please don't stay in this hotel anymore, not CTRIP is not good.This hotel is too bad.There are three Macopolu hotels on the road. Among them, Matthew Luo Harbor should be the best.At least the decoration of the 1990s, very bad.The room is very small, two beds are discharged.The sound insulation effect is not good.And there is a construction site behind the hotel, which is under construction a day, and it is terrible.During the check -in, holding a dual currency credit card, the front desk asked without asking, directly swipe the US dollar instead of RMB.Other Hong Kong merchants or hotels will ask at least one dollar or RMB when swiping the credit card?Just install B like this.NND.too poor.I won't live in the future!IntersectionIntersection"
1,房间很大，服务也很好，地理位置比较好，但宾馆门前停车很不方便，比较窄。,"The room is large, the service is also good, and the geographical location is better, but the parking in front of the hotel is inconvenient and narrow."
1,非常不错的酒店，紧靠首都图书馆，交通非常方便。房间设施很齐全，还有洗衣机和微波炉、咖啡壶。性价比非常高，下次出差的首选。,"Very good hotel, close to the Capital Library, the transportation is very convenient.The room facilities are very complete, as well as washing machines and microwave oven and coffee pots.The cost performance is very high, the first choice for the next business trip."
1,看了介绍，带老婆孩子去了，其实是一种尝试，想看看究竟是否真的还好。优点：1，前台的动作很迅速，对于入住和结帐都是非常的周到、迅速。2，门童、保安都很热情。我们要出去，叫车的时候居然司机说不认识。还好有个非常负责的门童，就在那里一个一个司机问，直到有一个司机愿意送我们去为止，让老婆感觉很感动。3，房间很好，而且客房服务很到位。我们是带了个5岁的女儿，他们看见了，就把我们的所有的洗漱用品等都增加到3份。虽然不一定值钱，但是女儿很开心，用她的话说：“这是给我用的东西。”4，房间的隔音不错，床的软硬适中。女儿晚上10点多睡觉，居然一直睡到了隔天的上午11点，以至于我担心结帐的时间都不够。缺点虽然有，但是不是大的，而且提出了以后都及时改进，让人很开心。进酒店还有为携程客户专门提供的饮料、水果，让孩子很开心。以后再去杭州，肯定还是住那里，很好。已经推荐几个朋友去了，希望他们也一样满意。宾馆反馈2008年8月7日：非常感谢您对我们酒店服务的肯定。酒店会不断的努力，提升酒店品质，提高服务质量。衷心期待您的再次光临！,"After reading the introduction, taking my wife and children is actually a kind of attempt. I want to see if it is really good.Advantages: 1. The movement of the front desk is very fast, and it is very thoughtful and fast for check -in and checkout.2. The door children and security guards are very enthusiastic.We were going out, and when we called the car, the driver said he didn't know.Fortunately, there was a very responsible door child, where the driver asked, until a driver was willing to send us, making his wife feel very moved.3. The room is very good, and the room service is in place.We brought a 5 -year -old daughter. When they saw it, they increased all of our washed products to 3.Although it is not necessarily valuable, her daughter is very happy. She said in her words: ""This is something for me."" 4, the sound insulation in the room is good, and the bed is moderate.My daughter slept at 10 o'clock in the evening, but she slept until 11 am the next day, so that I was worried that the time of checkout was not enough.Although there are disadvantages, it is not large, and it will be improved in time after it is proposed, which makes people happy.Entering the hotel also has drinks and fruits specially provided by Ctrip customers, making children very happy.Go to Hangzhou in the future, it must still live there, it is good.I have recommended a few friends, I hope they are as satisfied.Hotel feedback on August 7, 2008: Thank you very much for your affirmation of our hotel service.Hotels will continue to work hard to improve hotel quality and improve service quality.I sincerely look forward to your visit again!"
1,豪华房很新很漂亮，象套间一样大，有一个专门的行李间；阳台很大，洗手间既有浴缸也有淋浴，还有个小梳妆间。服务也一流，都是见过世面的姑娘们，专业而得体。餐厅也很好，“吃在丁山”嘛，就是价格也是五星级的了。总之是个超级好酒店，专为住这儿，也值得来南京一次呢！,"The luxurious room is very new and beautiful. It is as large as the sleeve. There is a special luggage room; the balcony is large, the bathroom has both bathtubs and shower, and a small dressing room.The service is also first -rate, and all the girls who have seen the world are professional and decent.The restaurant is also very good. ""Eat it in Dingshan"" is that the price is also five -star.In short, it is a super good hotel. For living here, it is worth visiting Nanjing!"
1,我们住的三人间，房间很宽敞，卫生间不大，但都很干净。宾馆餐厅很实惠，我们只要能回宾馆，就在餐厅用餐。周边交通非常方便，基本上一部车就到各个景点，走到什刹海等处也很近。最近宾馆在外部装修，不过不影响内部卫生和晚间休息。总体来说，我们住的都挺满意。,"The three people we live in, the room is spacious, the bathroom is not large, but it is clean.The hotel and restaurant are very affordable. As long as we can return to the hotel, we can dine in the restaurant.The surrounding traffic is very convenient. Basically, a car is close to various attractions, and it is very close to Shichahai and other places.Recently, the hotel is decorated outside, but it does not affect internal hygiene and rest.Overall, we are very satisfied."
1,地点还算可以，后面就是火锅一条街，过桥没多远就到春熙路，价格也算划算，158还带双早.双床，两人住的话很便宜.当然这样的价格房间里面肯定不是特别豪华，但基本设施都可以，床头控制柜是坏的.其他都还好.,"The location is okay. There is a hot pot street in the back. It is not far from the bridge to Chunxi Road. The price is also cost -effective. 158 also brings double -beds. If the two live, it is cheap. Of courseIt is not particularly luxurious, but the basic facilities are fine. The bedside control cabinet is bad. Others are okay."
1,优点：1.地理位置好。在西街的入口处，离汽车总站步行5分钟之内即到。酒店对面是九九自行车行，不过通过携程订房酒店提供了免费自行车。晚上还是比较安静。酒店对面的黄记玉米汁店的玉米汁非常好喝，又浓又香。酒店的旅行社可安排银子岩半日游，很方便70每人包含往返交通，导游及门票。2.浴室的热水还是不错的，水量大温度适中。3.整体服务都不错。缺点：1.观景大床房的床非常硬，不是很舒服。2.酒店没有电梯。总之来阳朔玩这里还是不错的选择。,"Advantages: 1. Good geographical location.At the entrance of West Street, it will arrive within 5 minutes from the car terminal.Opposite the hotel is the Jiu or Nine Bicycles, but a free bicycle is provided through the Ctrip booking hotel.It is relatively quiet at night.The corn juice of the yellow corn juice shop opposite the hotel is very delicious, thick and fragrant.Hotel travel agencies can arrange silver rock half -day tour, which is very convenient for 70 to include round -trip transportation, tour guides and tickets.2. The hot water in the bathroom is still good, and the water volume is moderate.3. The overall service is good.Disadvantages: 1. The bed in the big bed room is very hard, not very comfortable.2. There is no elevator in the hotel.In short, Yangshuo is still a good choice here."
1,酒店还可以，房内有电脑，数字电视。早餐一般啦。隔音效果比较差，下面是商业街，不太安静。,"The hotel is okay, there are computers and digital TVs in the room.Breakfast is average.The sound insulation effect is relatively poor. Below is commercial street, not very quiet."
1,"总的来说比较满意,到店较晚(19:30才到)不仅没有要求确认信用卡,反而因为没有预定的大床房,免费升级为套房.房间可看到古运河,夜里的灯光相当美丽.酒店到景点即瘦西湖\个园都很近,南通路向西500米向北拐入汶河南路穿过市中心的文昌阁(文昌路)大约3公里就是北护城河向西即瘦西湖,向东即个园.原来以为西园酒店不错,看","Generally speaking, the store is late (19:30) not only does not request a credit card, but because there is no predetermined large bed room, it can be upgraded to a suite for free. The room can be seen in the room. The lights at night are quite beautiful. The hotel to the attraction is thin West Lake \ a garden is very close. Nantong Road turned west to north into Wenchang Pavilion (Wenchang Road) on Wenchang Pavilion (Wenchang Road) in the city center.East is a garden. I thought the West Garden Hotel was good, see"
0,太像公寓了！简直就是公寓！大厅感觉非常公寓，房间也公寓非常，居然还有厨房和相关设备，其实你根本没有机会使用，因为你不可能随身带餐具！,"Too much like apartment!It's just an apartment!The lobby feels very apartment, and the room is also very apartment. There are actually kitchen and related equipment. In fact, you have no chance to use it because you can't bring tableware with you!"
0,"我在台前排理退房,居然有其他房客直接到台不遵守前後次序,而台人依然所直接理插房客退房手,完全排秩序先後!真令我!同五星酒店,我老板住喜登,我在喜登酒店口排等出租,有人也是插直接上出租,但是喜登房立刻赳正插客人口和要求方下到正位置排等候;怪喜登可以登上成都最佳酒店排行第一.","I scheduled to check out in front of the stage. There were other tenants who went directly to the stage and did not comply with the order of the front and back, and the Taiwanese people still directly intervened the tenants to check out, and the order was completely orderly! Really!Xiden, I was renting at the mouthpiece of Xiden Hotel, and some people also put it on the rental directly, but Xiden's house immediately took the guest population and the requirements to go down to the positive position.Ranking first."
1,"酒店硬件和位置都好,但服务令人生气.12日大地震这一天,我通过携程入住了这酒店.第二天,因为办事延误了,没有来得及退房.下午携程问是否要退?但因已经过了十二点,我们要求延住,结果被告知二间房房价涨40元和50元了,说是星期一是特价,星期二取消特价了.我说我们连同住了两天应该是同一价,但酒店后来说,如果当时通过携程预订,住两天也是两个价的.如果退房的话,要收半天的费,还说三星以上宾馆加收10%服务费.总之感觉象是被宰了,今后是不会再入住这宾馆了.补充点评2008年5月14日：补；由于天下雨，我们要向酒店借伞，并出示住房证，告知我们是酒店客人。谁知被告知先登记，再每人押100元，缺乏人性化。同样的事发生在凤凰佳居酒店，只要出示房证登记就可以了。","The hotel's hardware and location are good, but the service is angry. On the 12th earthquake, I stayed in this hotel through Ctrip. The next day, because of the delay in the work, I did not have time to check out.Because it has passed at twelve o'clock, we ask for an extension, and the result is informed that the price of the two houses has risen by 40 yuan and 50 yuan.At the same price, but the hotel later, if you book through Ctrip at that time, it is also a price for two days. If you check out, you need to charge a half -day fee.If you are slaughtered, you will not stay in this hotel in the future. Add comments on May 14, 2008: Make up; due to the rain, we have to borrow an umbrella from the hotel and show the housing certificate to inform us that it is a hotel guest.Who knows that he was told to register first, and then 100 yuan per person, lacking humanization.The same thing happened at the Phoenix Jiaju Hotel, as long as the house certificate is registered."
1,我是本周5晚上入住假日酒店的，订的是海景房。酒店的周边环境很一般，所谓的海景也就是一个码头，和我想象的还是有一定的差距。周边的旅游设施也不是很完善。所谓的网球场也是冷冷清清。酒店的中餐厅味道不错，但是点菜的小姐缺乏职业道德。写菜的时候已经明确告知我要去掉其中的一道名为东江豆腐煲的菜，但是上菜的时候还是上了。不知道该酒店是怎样对员工进行培训的，2个人能吃4道菜吗？？？事后餐厅的领班还阵阵有词，让人感觉星级酒店和大排档没有太大的区别。,"I stayed at the Holiday Hotel on the 5th night of this week and ordered the sea view room.The surrounding environment of the hotel is very average. The so -called sea view is also a dock, and there is still a certain gap with what I imagine.The surrounding tourism facilities are not perfect.The so -called tennis court is also deserted.The Chinese restaurant in the hotel tastes good, but the lady who ordered the dishes lacks professional ethics.When I wrote the vegetables, I had clearly told me that I was going to remove the dishes called Dongjiang tofu pot, but I was still served.I don't know how the hotel is trained for employees. Can two people eat 4 dishes?IntersectionIntersectionAfterwards, the foreman of the restaurant also had a word, making people feel that there is not much difference between star hotels and stalls."
1,网上讲的房间是24平米，实际没有那么大。另外房的空调也不是很凉快!,"The room on the Internet is 24 square meters, which is actually not that big.In addition, the air conditioner of the house is not very cool!"

0,8月头通过携程订的两间标房，340元一间，原想四星级的标房应该很不错的，可到那一看，简直就是一个招待所的水准，装修陈旧，房间又小，25寸的电视机还锁在柜子里。很不值，下次肯定不会再去这里了。,"In August, the two standard rooms ordered by Ctrip were 340 yuan. The original four -star benchmark should be very good. But at that time, it is a standard of a guest house. Old decoration and small rooms are small.The 25 -inch TV is still locked in the cabinet.Very worthless, it will definitely not come here next time."
0,不可礼遇的垃圾酒店，房间设施陈旧，服务人员没有基本素质，宽带不能使用，床单上有头发，早上八点开始楼顶传来刺耳的钻头打孔的声音。能做的只有逃跑，结帐还花了25分钟。。。。,"The unsatisfactory garbage hotels, the room facilities are old, the service staff does not have basic quality, the broadband cannot be used, and the hair has hair on the sheets. Starting from the top of the building at eight in the morning, the sound of harsh drills punching.What I can do is run away, and it takes 25 minutes to check out.EssenceEssenceEssence"

1,住过服务最好的酒店之一（top3），服务热情到位，不是只认洋鬼子，酒店内有一家餐厅（但不属于酒店，不能签单），菜品很好还便宜。,"I have lived in one of the best hotels (TOP3). The service enthusiasm is in place. It is not only acknowledged a ghost. There is a restaurant in the hotel (but it does not belong to the hotel, cannot be signed). The dishes are very good and cheap."
1,很好！在闹市中难得隔开有这么个清静地，进去以后环境很好，有小桥亭子，有餐厅，很幽静，很舒服。我住的迎宾馆观景房还可以从窗户看到旁边公园，不错,"very good!There is such a quiet place in the downtown city. After entering, the environment is very good. There are small bridge pavilions and restaurants. It is quiet and comfortable.I can also see the park from the window from the window, which I live in the park, which is good"
1,房间布置的很别致，离松花江和索菲亚教堂都很近，值得推荐！,"The room is very unique, and it is very close to the Church of Songhuajiang and Sofia, which is worth recommending!"

1,以前在学校读书的时候老板曾经带我们去过这里打保龄和吃饭等等，环境不错，房间也挺舒服，是闵行区比较高档的酒店,"When I was studying at school before, the boss once took us here to play the bowling and meal. The environment is good and the room is quite comfortable. It is a high -end hotel in Minhang District."
0,管理混乱，脏、乱、差当地名声不好出租司机找不到此宾馆,"Management is chaotic, dirty, chaotic, and bad reputation."
0,"之前06年的时候入住感觉非常好，服务、硬件都不错。所以这次带父母、亲戚也入住这里，强力推荐了这家曾经感觉非常不错的酒店。可这次的感觉完全两样，可以这么说很失望很没面子。1。当日入住的时候，我是按照预定单上注明的在11点左右办理入住手续（总共预定了4间），前台小姐竟然告诉我只有一间干净房，两间脏房还没有打扫，另一间没有。当时就很不爽，明明之前已经确定的，而且通过携程订的，也确认过订单，且就在我入住的前5分钟还接到携程的再次确认电话，竟然跟我说没房间，还跟我说房间要到12：00才可能退出来。晕阿，这什么酒店阿！经过一番争执总算讨到了四间原本就预定好的房间。真是辛苦啊！2。其中有间房间要换房间楼上和楼下的服务员说辞不一致，换房差价上又折腾半天，后来由于赶时间出去玩也就不合他们争了。服务员的培训真是应该加强！3。第二天早上早餐，由于每间只有一份早餐，所以小孩需要加早餐，又碰到前一天相同问题，不同服务员的说辞不一样。原本下楼用餐前就打电话咨询过三个小孩，两个1.4米一个1米优惠下50块就好了，结果餐厅用餐时又变了两个1.4米要全价，1米的半价。真是十分的不爽。争执后也就算了，按原价支付，懒得和酒店搞，折腾得自己心情不美丽。4。最令人气愤的是这一点，凌晨5点多竟然在四星的酒店里面被热醒，前提是我空调开到22度，竟然会被热醒，我LG打赤膊都在浑身冒汗，其他亲戚住的房间也有这样的状况发生。竟然为了节能关空调，太让人生气了。打电话给房务中心，结果是总台接的电话，说什么水温上去了，没有关空调，然后我请他请当班经理解释空调的事，竟然在10分钟后随便找了个服务员来搪噻我。在我电话投诉后，才将中央空调重新开启。什么酒店阿，对得起他那闪闪亮的四颗星吗？关中央空调能节约他们多少能源费阿？真不知道酒店是如何考虑的，客人重要还是节约下来的那么一点点的能源成本重要？后来下楼和酒店经理交涉半天也没有结果也不解决问题，心情非常不爽阿，最后只有收拾东西办理离店手续，谁叫咱是弱势群体呢。结帐时酒店经理过来又解释说没有关空调，是水温上去了，所以温度高了，然后将我们投诉的没有空调的2间房房价打了9折。这时我已经没心情和酒店多罗嗦了，赶紧结了帐走人，不要让我出游的美丽心情再次受到影响。试问如果酒店真的问心无愧没有关空调那么你干嘛来给我的房间打折扣呢。补充点评2008年8月11日：5.卫生间的莲蓬头也不怎么好使，折腾半天后才勉强冲了下,原本想换房，但是LG说小孩都睡了就不要折腾了（小孩是在亲戚的房间洗的澡）。宾馆反馈2008年8月15日：尊敬的宾客，您好！首先向您真诚的道歉，对于您在我们酒店入住的这段时间，我们没有为您服务好，是我们工作的失误以及平时培训的不到位。您所提出的批评是在帮助我们提高，在此向您表示衷心的感谢！我们一定接受您的意见，希望您下次再来时我们能为您提供更好的服务。祝您和您的家人身体健康，工作顺利！","I felt very good in check -in in 2006, and the service and hardware were good.So this time I took my parents and relatives to stay here, and I strongly recommended this hotel that once felt very good.But the feeling this time is completely different, so I can say so disappointment and faceless.1.When I stayed on the same day, I went through the check -in procedures at about 11 o'clock in accordance with the scheduled list (a total of 4 reservations). The lady at the front desk told me that there was only one clean house. Two dirty houses have not cleaned up. The otherThere is no.At that time, it was very unhappy. It was obviously determined before, and the order was confirmed through Ctrip, and I received a confirmation phone from Ctrip in the first 5 minutes before my stay.It is said that the room will not be exited until 12:00.Halo, what hotel!After some disputes, I finally discussed four rooms that were originally scheduled.It's really hard!2.Among them, some rooms had to change the waiter upstairs and downstairs in the room.The training of the waiter should really be strengthened!3.Breakfast the next morning, because there was only one breakfast for each room, the child needs to add breakfast, and the same problem the same day before encountering the same problem. Different waiters have different rhetoric.Originally, I called three children before going downstairs. It was fine for two 1.4 meters of 1 meter to discount. As a result, the restaurant changed two 1.4 meters to a full price and half price of 1 meter.It's really upset.Even after the dispute, pay at the original price, but too lazy to do it with the hotel, tossing his own mood.4.The most angry thing is that this is hotly awakened in the four -star hotel at more than 5 am. The premise is that my air conditioner is 22 degrees, and it will be awakened. My LG is sweating.The room where relatives live in.It was too angry to turn off the air conditioner for energy saving.I called the housing center, and the result was the call from the main station. The water temperature went up and did not turn off the air conditioner. Then I asked him to be the manager of the class.I.After my telephone complaint, the central air conditioner was reopen.What hotel, is it worthy of his shiny four stars?How much energy does Guan Central Air Conditioner save them?I really do n’t know how the hotel is considering. Guests are important or a little bit of energy costs for saving?Later, I went downstairs to negotiate with the hotel manager for a long time and did not solve the problem for a long time. I was very unhappy. In the end, I only cleaned up to check the departure procedures. Who told us to be a vulnerable group.At the checkout, the hotel manager came over and explained that there was no air conditioner, it was the water temperature, so the temperature was high, and then the two house prices that we complained were 10 % off.At this time, I had no mood to be ashamed to the hotel, and hurriedly settled the account, don't let the beautiful mood of my traveling affected again.If the hotel is really conscience, there is no way to turn off the air conditioner, so why do you come to discount my room?Supplementary comment on August 11, 2008: 5. The shower head of the bathroom is not very easy to make. After a long time, I barely rushed. I wanted to change the house, but LG said that the children said that they would not toss when they fell asleep.Take a bath in the room).Hotel feedback on August 15, 2008: Dear guest, hello!First of all, I sincerely apologize to you. During this time when you stay in our hotel, we have not served you well. It is the mistakes of our work and the usual training.The criticism you put forward is to help us improve, and I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to you!We must accept your opinion, and hope that you can provide you with better services next time you come again.I wish you and your family are healthy and work smoothly!"

1,7月份入住的厦门宾馆，觉得非常好，前台的服务员非常有礼貌，我随口提了了一下其他住客免费升级一类的事，马上帮我免费从双人间升到大床房，房间超大，搞得靠在床上看电视觉的有点远，呵呵。而且那位服务员第二天见到还问候我“某某小姐，你好。”，超好记性，最后一天还帮我申请到晚退房。遗憾的是没有记住她的名字（好像叫周x秀），不然可以打电话去表扬表扬。房间设施也非常不错，我觉得还是算新的。而且酒店本身就有自己的花园可以散步，马路斜对面就是万石植物园（本人极力推荐在最后一天，要坐下午飞机的游客朋友，在上午花几个小时在里面，非常大而且打理很好的植物园）。酒店离热闹的步行街也是步行可至，门口有公车去机场，鼓浪屿，厦大等地，便利之极。下次去厦门一定还住这里。,"The Xiamen Hotel, who stayed in July, felt very good. The waiter at the front desk was very polite. I raised a few cases of other residents to upgrade for free. Immediately helped me rises from a double room to a large bed room for free. The room is large.It's a bit far away to watch the TV on the bed, haha.And the waiter saw the next day and greet me, ""Miss and so, hello."", Super well, and on the last day, I also helped me apply for a late room.Unfortunately, she did not remember her name (as if it was called Zhou X Xiu), otherwise they could call to praise the show.The room facilities are also very good, I think it is still new.And the hotel itself has its own garden to take a walk. On the opposite side of the road is the Wanshi Botanical Garden (I strongly recommend it on the last day. Tourists who want to take the plane in the afternoon will spend several hours in the morning.Botanical garden).The hotel is also walking away from the lively walking street. There are buses at the door to the airport, Gulangyu, Xiamen University and other places at the door, which is extremely convenient.Next time I go to Xiamen, I will still live here."
0,一句话，那是相当的差！这也叫3星，有没有搞错，旅馆水平都没有。大厅倒过得去。房间里面消毒水的味道奇大无比，进去半个钟头都适应不了。卫生间的东西感觉是进了个50元店，水泥糊的玻璃缝。老天，让我丢人丢到家了。强烈要求退钱！,"In a word, that's quite bad!This is also called 3 stars. Is there any mistake? There is no hotel level.The lobby is going to go.The smell of disinfection in the room is extremely great, and it can't adapt to half an hour.The bathroom things felt that they entered a 50 yuan store, cement paste glass seam.God, I was shameful to get home.Strongly ask for refund!"
1,服务很好，周围很热闹，打车吃饭都很方便。330/晚的房间比较小，但是干净整洁，虽然是四星的，但是总体感觉还是很不错，闹中取静。华清池里养了很多鱼，很漂亮，可以到前台买了鱼食来喂。,"The service is very good, the surroundings are very lively, and it is convenient to take a taxi and eat.The 330/night room is relatively small, but it is clean and tidy. Although it is four -star, the overall feeling is still very good.There are a lot of fish in Huaqing Pond, which is very beautiful. You can buy fish food at the front desk to feed."
1,安庆宾馆确实不错，给人的感觉满舒服的，但也存在缺点优点：1.环境安静.2.每天有水果，且空调在您回房间前已经开启，进入房间后非常舒服。3.房间较大，住的满舒服的。缺点：1.我住的是2楼，窗户不能上锁，不够安全2.没有电梯.3.早餐8点半前较好，过8点半没什么东西吃4.结帐较慢总体来说，还是满不错，下次去还住,"Anqing Hotel is really good, it feels comfortable, but there are also shortcomings: 1. The environment is quiet. 2. There are fruits every day, and the air conditioner has been opened before you return to the room. It is very comfortable after entering the room.3. The room is larger and comfortable to live.Disadvantages: 1. I live on the second floor. The windows cannot be locked. It is not safe. 2. There is no elevator. 3. Breakfast is better before 8:30.It's still good, go back to live next time"
1,环境不错，对着马路的房间窗外风景好，其他方向的房间看出去是居民房。房间干净，设施也都完好。,"The environment is good, the scenery is good outside the road window of the road, and the rooms in other directions see that it is a residential room.The room is clean and the facilities are intact."
0,服务态度很差，房间很破旧，居然还是4星！！！看电视的时候千万要小心，很容易会按错遥控器上的按钮，有很多收费电视，按一下按钮就确认收费了！,"The service attitude is very poor, the room is very shabby, and it is still 4 stars!IntersectionIntersectionBe careful when watching TV. It is easy to press the button on the wrong remote control. There are a lot of toll TVs. Press the button to confirm the charge!"
1,地段不错，性价比不高，向阳的房间外面有装饰大灯，换了房间背阳感觉上有一股发霉的味道，结帐的时间较长。房间内有电脑可以上网，但没有瓶装水供应不应该。,"The location is good, the cost -effective is not high. There is a decorative headlight outside Xiangyang's room. The back of the room back to the back of the room feels a moldy taste, and the checkout time is longer.There are computers in the room to access the Internet, but no bottle of water supply should not be."
0,携程订单上写明：“房型特点：一张1.3*2，另一张1.1*2米，无法加床全部房间有免费宽带”，实际入住后见到的房间是我所见过的最小的标准间，两个床尺寸相同，床的两边均靠着墙，没有一点多余的空间，甚至连放行李的地方也没有，更不要提什么橱了，跟酒店提出与所订房间不同，他们说我们订的房间空调坏了，只能换这个房间，价格一样。我不知道这是酒店的欺诈还是携程的欺诈，我要求得到赔偿。如果需要证据的话，我有实拍的房间照片。另外，建议大家不要出泰山旅游，几乎一半的酒店会不定时，无预警的停电。,"Ctrip orders stated on the order: ""Chamber characteristic: one 1.3*2, and the other 1.1*2 meters, you can't add all rooms to have free broadband.""In between, the size of the two beds is the same, and the two sides of the bed are against the wall. There is no excess space, and even the place where the luggage is put.The air conditioner in the booked room is broken, and you can only change this room. The price is the same.I don't know if this is the hotel's fraud or Ctrip's fraud, I ask for compensation.If you need evidence, I have a photo of the real room.In addition, it is recommended that you do not travel to Taishan. Almost half of the hotels will have no power outages from time to time."
1,房间稍显局促，我们住的双床房（大床房没有了）。隔音效果不太好，晚上很晚了还有人在走道上喧哗，可以很清晰的听到。10块钱的自助早餐还不错，方便！,"The room was slightly promoted, and the double beds we lived in (the big bed room was gone).The sound insulation is not very good. At night, there are still people making noise on the aisle, and they can be heard clearly.The buffet breakfast for 10 yuan is not bad, convenient!"
1,"不错,交通方便,楼下就是美食城.豪华房有液晶电脑.或许标准房也有吧.卫生间稍小了点,是淋浴房.","Yes, it is convenient for transportation, there is a food city downstairs. Luxury rooms have LCD computers. Perhaps the standard rooms also have it. The bathroom is a little smaller, it is a shower room."
1,地点在横店最热闹的万盛街上，晚上出来逛夜市的话很方便。,The location is on the busiest street of Hengdian. It is convenient to come out to visit the night market at night.
1,冲着恐龙园的门票去的，房间布置装修比较满意，卫浴设计小孩子很喜欢，因为可以直接从浴缸里爬到床上。房间比较宽敞，园景房的阳台上景观也不错。因为害怕有蚊子所以特地带了蚊不叮去，没想到酒店在阳台上装了纱门，很不错。特别提一下酒店的中餐厅用餐环境很好，透明落地玻璃旁用餐很舒服，味道也很不错。下次去还会选择该酒店。唯一不足的是310房间半夜的时候阳台上有风刮过的时候移门发出很怪异的响声，让人心里很是害怕，再加上超级差的隔音，导致我晚上几乎没睡着。,"Tickets for the dinosaur garden, the room layout is relatively satisfactory, and the bathroom design children like it because they can be climbed directly from the bathtub to the bed.The room is relatively spacious, and the landscape on the balcony of the garden view is also good.I was afraid of mosquito because I was afraid of mosquitoes. I did not expect the hotel to install the gauze on the balcony. It was very good.In particular, the food environment in the hotel's Chinese restaurant is very good. The meal next to the glass is very comfortable and the taste is very good.Next time you go, you will choose the hotel.The only disadvantage was that in the middle of the 310 room in the middle of the night, when the wind was scratched on the balcony, the door moved to make a very weird noise, which made people feel very scared. In addition, the super -poor sound insulation led me to hardly fall asleep at night."
1,酒店位置不错，距天府广场和春曦路走路大概25分钟、打车5分钟。房间、服务也不错，够三星水平。只是早餐过于简单。房间地毯、墙纸略显陈旧了。,"The hotel location is good. It is about 25 minutes away from Tianfu Square and Chunxi Road and 5 minutes by taxi.The room and service are also good, enough for Samsung.It's just that breakfast is too simple.Room carpet and wallpaper are slightly old."

0,"之前住过三次,房间,早餐,服务都很好,所以这次又入住了,没想到,这次房间(九楼)非常差,应该是老装修了,还不如对面的三星的紫薇酒店,和之前住的房间天壤之别,同志们预定的时候千万注意挑选楼层自助早餐的水准大不如从前服务水准还好,再也不会住了","I have lived three times before, the room, breakfast, and service are very good, so I stayed again this time. I did not expect that the room (ninth floor) was very poor. It should be the old decoration.The rooms that lived before were very different. When comrades booked, they would pay attention to choosing the level of self -service breakfast floors."
0,携程推荐的3星级酒店，但实际感觉房间里不如个招待所，小不说，而且脏乱。停车场不敢恭维，只能纵向停3路车，如果是早进去的话，出来很麻烦。我是早上7点要出去，结果后面堵了个皮卡（不是住宿的，是保安的关系户，附近小区的居民），愣是8点半才给我挪开。所以我给它服务评分1分。希望改进！,"The 3 -star hotel recommended by Ctrip, but in fact, I feel that the room is not as good as a guest house.The parking lot dare not compliment. It can only stop 3 vehicles vertically. If it goes early, it is troublesome to come out.I went out at 7 am, but I blocked a pickup card (not in accommodation, the residents of the security guard, the residents of the nearby community).So I give it a score of 1 point.Hope to improve!"
1,房间不错，硬件设施非常好，最值得赞扬的是其房间的网速，迅雷下载时达到了3M，说实话，这是我这辈子见到过的最快网速，好几部电影几分钟就下载了，无法相信有这么快的网速！！！,"The room is good, the hardware facilities are very good. The most praise is the speed of the room. It reached 3M when downloading the Thunder. To be honest, this is the fastest Internet speed I have seen in my life.I can't believe there is such a fast internet speed!IntersectionIntersection"
1,"在携程上订了一天，实际入住两天，酒店照携程价加收了一天房费，并为我免费升级了商务房。中间问酒店前台借过指甲剪，他们说没有，建议这类的小物品还是应该提供服务方便客人。吃过一顿自助早餐，品种还算可以，就是没有牛奶，只有豆浆和咖啡。总体感觉还算可以，酒店也比较新比较干净，就是隔音比较差，经常很吵，酒店出门就有地铁和公交线，有公交直达上海动物园呵呵。还有酒店延迟退房时间没有商量余地，这个不好玩。宾馆反馈2008年5月20日：感谢您对我们酒店的评价,更加感谢您对我们提的建议。在我们如家酒店的服务规范中，指甲剪之类的租借物品前台是应该免费提供给客人方便的。对这次未能向您提供服务，给您所造成的不便，我们诚恳致歉，请您原谅！以后我们酒店会加强对此类细节的关注，不再让您失望！自助早餐每天的品种是不一样的，一般是Ａ．Ｂ．Ｃ三套互换的，饮料中牛奶、豆浆、咖啡、红茶和橙汁等几种饮料也是互换的，今后夏天我们还会增加一些冰冻冷饮。您假如需要牛奶，可以向我们的服务生提出，她们会很乐意为您服务的。，欢迎您下次光临我们如家快捷北虹路店，我们一定会让您感觉到我们一天天的进步，也希望您给我们这样的机会证明给您看！","After booked a day on Ctrip, in the actual stay in two days, the hotel's price increased the house fee and upgraded the business house for free for me.In the middle, I asked the hotel at the front desk of the hotel to borrow nail shear. They said no, it is recommended that small items of this type should still provide services to facilitate guests.After eating a buffet breakfast, the variety is okay, there is no milk, only soy milk and coffee.The overall feeling is okay. The hotel is relatively new and clean, that is, the sound insulation is relatively poor, and it is often very noisy. The hotel has subway and bus lines when it goes out.There is also a hotel delayed check -up time without discussing room, which is not fun.Hotel feedback on May 20, 2008: Thank you for your evaluation of our hotel, and thank you for your suggestions on us.In the service specifications of our home hotel, the front desk of rental items such as tidal shear should be provided for guests for free.We sincerely apologize to the inconvenience caused by failing to provide you this time and the inconvenience caused by you, please forgive me!In the future, our hotel will strengthen the attention of such details and no longer disappoint you!The daily variety of buffet breakfast is different, usually A.B.C three sets of swaps. Drinks such as milk, soy milk, coffee, black tea, and orange juice in drinks are also interchangeable. In the future, we will add some frozen and cold drinks.If you need milk, you can propose to our waiters, and they will be happy to serve you.Welcome to visit our fast Beihong Road store next time, we will definitely make you feel our progress every day, and I hope you will give us such opportunities to prove it to you!"
1,酒店比较干净，服务也还不错。停车也较方便,The hotel is relatively clean and the service is pretty good.Parking is more convenient
0,第一次住锦江得酒店，也是最热闹得一家酒店了．．等了半小时才办好入住．数字电视晚上断线，电视好了．宽带又断．本来说为了补偿给我按照会员价（比携程价便宜１０元），结果第二天也没说什么．结账得时候又等了将近半个小时．凌晨５点竟然还给我闹火警！！！吓的半死，理由是二楼食堂做早餐烟太大．我晕到死．．．．．下次肯定不会来了．,"The first time I stayed at the Jinjiang Destry, it was also the most lively hotel...Wait half an hour to do it.Digital TV is broken at night, and the TV is good.Break again.Originally, in order to compensate me at the membership price (10 yuan cheaper than the port price), I did not say anything the next day.At the time of checkout, I waited for nearly half an hour.At 5 o'clock in the morning, I returned to me!IntersectionIntersectionI was scared half dead, because the second -floor cafeteria was too big to make breakfast.I was fainted until I died.........It will definitely not come next time."
0,因为到达时间有点晚，所以携程的房间取消了。只好拿了2个套房和4个单间。房间是日式的，面积确实太小了。单人床只有1.1米宽！没想到是经济型酒店，很失望。浴室没有干湿隔断，洗完澡，水漫金山，拖鞋湿了，地砖特滑。优点是房间新，风格时尚，有浴袍，拖鞋质量还行。,"Because the arrival time was a bit late, Ctrip's room was canceled.I had to take 2 suites and 4 single rooms.The room is Japanese, and the area is indeed too small.Single bed is only 1.1 meters wide!Unexpectedly, it was a economy hotel and was disappointed.The bathroom has no wet and wet partitions. After bathing, the water is long, the slippers are wet, and the floor tiles are very slippery.The advantage is that the room is new, stylish, with bathrobes, and slippers quality."
1,498元的价格不是很厚道，但位置还是可以，预定时携程说酒店要信用卡担保，担保后到了酒店时，酒店说我预定的标准间没有了，免费个给我升级到套房。房间很大，感觉不错。,"The price of 498 yuan is not very kind, but the location is still possible. When you are scheduled, Ctrip said that the hotel needs a credit card guarantee. When the guarantee arrives at the hotel, the hotel said that the standard room I scheduled is gone, and it will be upgraded to the suite for free.The room is big and feels good."
1,"地点不是很好,虽然有路标,但还是有点难找.房间够大,看窗外时视野很宽.设施齐全,包括需要消费的私人用品,就是价格高了点.用餐方便,品种还可以.但自助餐的质量不是很高,改进哦~~~服务很到位,入住和退房的办理速度都很快.电话接线生态度超好,打到房间的电话需要先确认客人姓名.免除了骚扰电话,比较有安全感.去机场的路很顺畅,就是出门打不到的士.有点郁闷!总体上说:不错!已经是第二次入住了.希望还有第三次第四次第N次!哦,那我在深圳买房算了!CCCCCCCCCC~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~","The location is not very good. Although there are roadbags, it is still a bit difficult to find. The room is large enough. When you look at the window, the field of vision is very wide. The facilities are complete, including private products that need to be consumed, which is a bit higher.The quality of buffets is not very high, improved ~~~ The service is in place, and the handling and check -in are very fast. The ecosystem of the phone wiring is super good. The call to the room needs to confirm the name of the guest.There is a sense of security. The road to the airport is smooth, that is, a taxi who can't go out. A little depressed! Generally speaking: Yes! It's the second time to stay.Then I bought a house in Shenzhen! Ccccccccccccc ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"
1,这次的价格比以前贵一点，但是还是客户来住的首选。环境非常好的，服务也好。出了门口的服务生呆呆的，其他都赞。,"The price this time is a bit more expensive than before, but it is the first choice for customers to live.The environment is very good and the service is good.The waiter at the door was dumb, and everyone else praised."
1,我住的是套房，房间很好，环境更好。酒店的早餐等的时间太久，他们主要接团，散客的服务跟不上。,"I live in a suite, the room is very good, and the environment is better.The hotel's breakfast has been for too long, they mainly pick up the group, and the service of the customer can't keep up."
1,早点还可以，酒店环境很好。不过丁山楼还是和主楼有很大的差距,"Early, the hotel environment is very good.However, there is a big gap with the main building"
1,服务态度非常好，从行李员到服务员都彬彬有礼，在大堂等待期间会主动给我们准备毛巾和茶水，在很多五星级酒店都没有这样的服务。每天房间都有送水果，虽然质量不怎么样。中西式早餐很不错，品种丰富。由于房费含双早，因此总体性价比非常高。,"The service attitude is very good. From the luggage to the waiter, the waiter is polite. During the lobby, we will take the initiative to prepare towels and tea for us. There are no such services in many five -star hotels.There are fruits every day, although the quality is not good.Chinese and Western breakfast is very good and rich in varieties.Because the housing fee contains double early, the overall cost performance is very high."
1,总的来说，酒店还不错。比较安静，地理位置比较好，服务也不错，包括入住和结账。不太好的地方，7点早餐才开始，时间有点晚，第一天急着办事情。第二天8点去吃的时候，剩下的都凉了，没有添新的，有点没吃饱。,"In general, the hotel is not bad.It is relatively quiet, the geographical location is better, and the service is good, including check -in and checkout.If you are not very good, the breakfast starts at 7 o'clock, and the time is a bit late. On the first day, he was in a hurry.When I went to eat at 8 o'clock the next day, the rest was cold."
0,此酒店位置太偏，附近没有商业网点，很不方便。房间的墙壁，厕所有点不干净。虽有早餐，但早上7点前不提供。我因要赶早班车，需7点前离店，只能去吃他们付费餐厅的早餐。很奇怪，同样的厨房，付费的就有，附送的早餐就没有。,"The location of this hotel is too biased, and there is no commercial outlets nearby, which is very inconvenient.The wall of the room is not clean.Although there are breakfast, it is not provided before 7 am.I want to leave the shop before 7 o'clock, and I can only go to the breakfast of their paid restaurants.It is strange that the same kitchen has paid, and there is no breakfast that is attached."
0,酒店太脏且设施陈旧，不符合三星标准，前台价格低于携程价格,"The hotel is too dirty and old, and the facilities are not in line with Samsung standards. The price of the front desk is lower than the Ctrip price"
1,酒店位于沙田，空气清新，房间也比较大，液晶电视机是放在很大的窗台上的，宾馆门口就是沙田城门河，河对面就是沙田最大的商业区，还有香港文化博物馆。对了，每周三，香港艺术馆、香港科学馆和香港文化博物馆是免费开放的，有兴趣的旅友可以去参观一下。,"The hotel is located in Shatian, the air is fresh, and the room is relatively large. LCD TVs are placed on a large window sill. At the door of the hotel is the Shatian City Gate, the largest business district of Shatian opposite the river, and the Hong Kong Cultural Museum.By the way, every Wednesday, the Hong Kong Art Museum, the Hong Kong Science Museum and the Hong Kong Cultural Museum are open for free. Interested travelers can visit."
1,酒店环境很好，不过入住的时候酒店大堂把房间搞错了（我订的是大床，他们给的是双床，开始向他们反应的时候说没有房间，后来不知道为什么又有了）。另外，房间居然有蚊子！！！,"The hotel environment is very good, but the hotel lobby made the room wrong when I checked in (I booked a big bed, they gave a double bed, and when they started to respond to them, they said that there was no room, and I did not know why there was).In addition, there are mosquitoes in the room!IntersectionIntersection"
1,环境十分棒，住着感到特别安全。本人住的是主楼28204房，客房服务人员和前台小姐、门童的态度都十分好。美中不足之处是早餐一般，有时客人没有吃完，早餐部的服务人员就自己坐下来吃了，需要改进。此外，打的需要时间等待，因为实在是庭院深深，适合有车的朋友住。,"The environment is great, and I feel very safe to live.I live in room 28204 in the main building. The attitude of guest room service staff, the front desk lady, and the door children are very good.The disadvantage of the United States and China is that the breakfast is average. Sometimes the guests do not finish, and the service staff of the breakfast department sit down and eat it. It needs to be improved.In addition, it takes time to wait, because it is really deep in the courtyard, suitable for friends with cars."
1,酒店位置不错房间一般但是早餐还是不错的餐厅比较好对得起价格下回应该还会住,"The hotel location is good, but the restaurant with a good breakfast is better."
1,我是第二次入住这个酒店了，蛮喜欢它的，相比而言，它比三亚湾酒店便宜且交通便利，去机场、南山、天涯海角、西岛都很方便；另外海滩及外围环境比大东海的酒店安静、清爽。房间很大干净，有阳台海景不错，游泳池也不错，好几个各有特色，适合小孩老人玩耍。酒店外是三亚有名的椰梦长廊，跨过此条小马路就是沙滩，马路边有许多出租、公交中巴和旅游车经过，所以出行很方便。另外还有小摩的，一块钱一位，超便宜，可在傍晚坐上摩的出游，享受海风和椰林！缺点：酒店设施相比较大东海的银泰酒店较为陈旧，色彩灰暗，但服务员较热情，大堂的前台太小了，不知那么大的大堂为什么会有这么不气派的前台？另外就是吃饭问题，酒店附近没有大东海那么多的小吃店，跟摩的去了一家海鲜店，味道还好，却被大斩一把（还好提前已做好被斩的准备，所以买单时也不惊慌了）！如果怕麻烦又可不考虑价格，建议还是在酒店用餐，中餐还不错，广粤味，可以推荐。SPA是去年第一次入住时去过，感觉没有太特别的，但价格偏高。,"I have been in this hotel for the second time. I like it quite. In contrast, it is cheaper and convenient than Sanya Bay Hotel. It is very convenient to go to the airport, Nanshan, Tianya Haijiao, and Ximao.The hotel in Donghai is quiet and refreshing.The room is very clean, the balcony seascape is good, and the swimming pool is also good. Several distinctive features are suitable for children and old people to play.Outside the hotel is the famous Coconut Dream Corridor in Sanya. It is a beach across this small road. There are many rental, buses, and travel cars by the road, so travel is very convenient.There are also Xiaomo, one dollar, super cheap, you can take a travel travel in the evening and enjoy the sea breeze and coconut forests!Disadvantages: The Yintai Hotel in the East China Sea is relatively old and dark, but the waiter is more enthusiastic. The front desk of the lobby is too small. I do n’t know why there is such an uncomfortable front desk?The other is the problem of eating. There are no snack bars near the Donghai near the hotel. I went to a seafood shop with Mo Mo. The taste was okay, but it was cut.Don't panic)!If you are afraid of trouble and do not consider the price, it is recommended to eat at the hotel. Chinese food is good, Guangyue flavor, you can recommend it.The SPA was the first time I stayed in last year. It didn't feel too special, but the price was high."
1,酒店的服务和园林是好得没话说的啦，房间设施就一般，有的旧了，但被铺还是很干净舒服，就是580的价钱有点贵！,"The service and gardens of the hotel are so good that the room facilities are average, some are old, but the shop is still very clean and comfortable, that is, the price of 580 is a bit expensive!"
1,房间还不错，干净整洁，可以免费上网比较爽，另外还可以在每天有200个高尔夫练习球，也不错。酒店周边环境还好。两个地方不太满意，一是我住的房间窗户外面对着一个破车场（这个好像是很难改变的，没办法）；二是商务中心不能帮忙邮寄大连风景的明信片到国外，而且明信片不卖单张，只卖整套的，很不爽！,"The room is not bad, clean and tidy, it can be free to go online for free. In addition, you can have 200 golf practice balls every day, which is also good.The environment around the hotel is okay.Two places are not very satisfied. One is that the room window I live in is facing a car -breaking park (this seems to be difficult to change, there is no way); the second is that the business center cannot help mail the postcard in Dalian landscape abroad, and postcards and postcards, and postcardsNot selling a single one, only selling the whole set, very unhappy!"
0,酒店的管理不专业，服务非常差，房间的空调不足，冬天的被子象夏天被，晚上住宿要用自己的羽绒衣防寒。,"The hotel's management is unprofessional, the service is very poor, and the air conditioner in the room is insufficient. The quilt in winter is like summer. At night, you need to use your own down jacket to prevent cold."
1,只在酒店休息了几个小时，没有来得及吃早餐，也没有看到所谓的10元抵餐券。房间内的设施还是挺丰富的，比较新的酒店，标间的床太小了，对于大块头的客人来说有点紧张。前台的服务意识还是不错，下次要好好享受一下酒店的服务。宾馆反馈2008年8月4日：感谢您的点评，酒店会重视您的建议，不断完善产品，期待您再次光临，入住体验，并给予我们更多建议。谢谢！,"I just took a few hours in the hotel, did not have time to eat breakfast, and did not see the so -called 10 yuan coupon.The facilities in the room are still very rich. The new hotels are too small in the standard room, which is a bit nervous for large guests.The service awareness of the front desk is still good. Next time, you must enjoy the hotel service.Hotel feedback on August 4, 2008: Thank you for your comments. The hotel will pay attention to your suggestions, continuously improve the product, and look forward to your visit again, check -in experience, and give us more suggestions.Thanks!"
1,酒店很大，服务太差，Ａ楼房间也老，下次再也不住了。环境很好，打高尔夫的或许可以忍忍吧。,"The hotel is very large, the service is too poor, and the room A room is also old, and I can't stop it again next time.The environment is very good, you may be able to bear the golf."
0,1.上了半天网，都上不去，问酒店，答曰坏了。气愤！2.晚上入住适逢变天，天气变冷，开了半天空调，竟然还是冷风，问酒店，答曰晚上关空调。晕！床上只有一床单被，到处找被子，无。问酒店要，半小时催了三次电话才来。还是冷，要求在加一床被子，服务员去后再也没回，打到总台，又等了半天，回复没被子了。不把顾客当人啊。3.一晚没睡成，凌晨5点多，被不知道哪里来的低沉的轰鸣声吵醒。在房间找了半天没查出哪里来得声音，叫来服务员，（半小时催了三四次才来，人都要疯掉）。六点多服务员才来，也解决不了。就这么一夜没睡。买气受来了。4.到总台要求当班经理来解释，换了几个人来，说了几遍，酒店不断去落实事情真相，最后才来一个自称客服经理的，说却有其事，表示道歉，做了一小时的冷板凳，一口热水没喝，口都讲干了。这就是他们的诚意。总结：硬件老旧，服务太差。,"1. After a long time on the net, I ca n’t get on, ask the hotel, and the answer is broken.Angry!2. Checking in at night coincides with the sky, the weather becomes cold, and the air conditioner has been opened for a long time. It was still cold. Asked the hotel, answered the air conditioner at night.faint!There is only one sheet quilt on the bed, looking for quilts everywhere, none.Asked the hotel, I called it three times in half an hour before coming.Still cold, I asked for an additional quilt, and the waiter did not return again after gone, hit the head station, waited for a long time, and returned to the quilt.Don't take customers as a person.3. I did not sleep in the night, more than 5 o'clock in the morning, and was awakened by the low roar that I didn't know where it came.I found the sound for a long time in the room, and called the waiter (three or four times in half an hour before coming, and everyone had to go crazy).Only at six o'clock, the waiter could not solve it.I didn't sleep like this.Buy qi.4. When I went to the main station to ask the manager to explain, I changed a few people and said it a few times. The hotel continued to implement the truth of the matter. Finally, I came to a self -proclaimed customer service manager.The hourly cold bench, I didn't drink a hot water, and my mouth was dry.This is their sincerity.Summary: The hardware is old and the service is too poor."
1,酒店名称和外面挂牌不一样，头一次到告诉出租海天酒店都不知道，只有按照门派找，结果就是东胜大厦，环境，设施，早餐，服务都是一流的，房间进去有个长走廊，非常好，可以杜绝早上门口的任何声响影响美梦，房间两面都有落地窗，视野非常好，大床超级赞，太舒服了。周围商业方法，下次去还要住这里。,"The hotel name is different from the outside. I did n’t know the first time I arrived in the rental Hailian Hotel. The result was to find it according to the martial arts.Well, you can prevent any sound at the door in the morning affecting the dream. There are floor -to -ceiling windows on both sides of the room. The vision is very good. The big bed is super praised and too comfortable.The surrounding business method will live here next time."
0,这个酒店基本上我不太满意，住了那么多酒店，就这家酒店打扫房间还要人催的，回到房间下午5，6点了，房间居然还没有打扫，而且不是1天2天，住了10天，有一半以上都是这样。但是宾馆2天会送一盘水果，每天还有免费报纸。虽然这方面还不错，但是作为一家宾馆，尤其是要充四星级的宾馆，这样的服务未免有点太。。。。还有餐厅的服务也不好，上菜也上错，餐具都是灰尘。。。。下次不会选择这家宾馆，我个人对于房间的卫生打扫还是很在意的。,"This hotel is basically not very satisfied. I stayed in so many hotels, and the hotel was urged to clean the room. After returning to the room at 5 or 6 in the afternoon, the room has not been cleaned yet, and it is not 1 day and 2 days.After staying for 10 days, more than half of them are like this.However, the hotel will send a plate of fruits for 2 days, and there are free newspapers every day.Although it is not bad in this regard, as a hotel, especially for four -star hotels, such a service is a bit too much.EssenceEssenceEssenceThere is also a bad service for the restaurant, and the food is wrong, and the tableware is dust.EssenceEssenceEssenceI won't choose this hotel next time. I personally care about the hygiene cleaning of the room."
1,"酒店设施比较不错,就是携程的价格和酒店前台的都一样,没有竞争力","The hotel facilities are relatively good, that is, the price of Ctrip is the same as the front desk of the hotel, and there is no competitiveness."
0,我一年中国上上下下跑好多次，这个酒店是我住过性价比最差的酒店。1.服务态度恶差，也许我去的时候他们太忙，和他们说话都懒得鸟你。2.房间恶差，我住的房间补补贴，中国八十年代的建筑我不介意，可你用白漆涂涂吧。我房间墙是二个颜色，顶是三个颜色。当然，不是配色，而是补补贴贴的东西。3.电视，居然是使用天线~~没错，你没看错，他们还没有有线电视，更别指望卫星电视。4.房间恶脏，卫生间的马桶和台盆希里哗啦，地板边上都长霉。房间墙角上都是莫名“液体”5，地点太远，展馆边上也还要打的。6.早餐，别提了。7.对了，二楼门口是铁板，走起来晃晃悠悠，满廊桥的。同志们，如果你是去展会，还是住锦江之星或别的，反正都要打的。酒店老板，对不起，你实在太差了，对了，我的房间号是207.,"I ran up and down many times a year. This hotel is the most cost -effective hotel.1. The service attitude is bad. Maybe when I go, they are too busy, and they are too lazy to talk to them.2. The room is bad, the room I live in the room is subsidized, I don't mind the building in China in the 1980s, but you can paint it with white paint.My room wall is two colors, and the top is three colors.Of course, it is not a color matching, but a piece of replenishment.3. TV, actually using antenna ~~ Yes, you are not right, they have not yet cable TV, let alone expect satellite TV.4. The room is dirty, the toilet and the basin of the bathroom are rushing, and the floor is moldy.The corner of the room is inexplicable ""liquid"" 5, the location is too far, and it is still to be played by the exhibition hall.6. Breakfast, don't mention it.7. By the way, at the door of the second floor is iron plate.Comrades, if you go to the exhibition, or live in Jinjiang Star or anything else, you have to play anyway.Hotel owner, sorry, you are too bad, yes, my room number is 207."
1,"酒店位置在很市中心的地方,房间也不错,旁边有一个府山公园.早餐品种不是很丰富.","The hotel is located in the center of the city, and the room is also good. There is a Fushan Park next to it. The breakfast variety is not very rich."
1,酒店不算是最新的，但是房间和服务都很不错。因为地理位置原因，打的不如临街的酒店那么方便，酒店服务员和门童都很热情、细致，周到地为客户介绍最合适的出行方式和线路，感觉很好。,"The hotel is not the latest, but the rooms and services are very good.Due to geographical location, it is not as convenient as the hotels in the street. The hotel waiters and door children are very enthusiastic and meticulous. They introduce the most suitable travel methods and routes to customers. It feels good."
1,酒店设施确实旧了，但地毯可以换啊，好破还好脏，服务态度不错，每到一个客户，都有服务生送你进客房，还有一壶带保温设置的茶附送进房，很温馨。,"The hotel facilities are indeed old, but the carpet can be changed. It is so dirty and dirty. The service attitude is good. Every time a client, a waiter will send you to the guest room.Essence"
0,太脏，停车场太小，建议携程不要推荐这样的旅馆,"It's too dirty, the parking lot is too small, it is recommended that Ctrip not to recommend such a hotel"
1,"饭店较新,服务不错,旁边有小便利店,就是房价偏贵..","The restaurant is relatively new, the service is good, there is a small convenience store next to it, that is, the house price is too expensive .."
1,"第一次住这家酒店,住的是C房.携程推荐说这家酒店性价比高。380元的价格能在这个区域住到这样的酒店我感觉很满意了，宽带免费市内电话也不收费，早餐也还可以。之前看了网友的点评说前台服务不尽人意，这次感觉还可以呀，基本能做到主动热情周到，个人觉得这就够了，当然如果谁习惯5星级服务，到这里肯定会失望，以这个预算，住这样的房间，受这样的服务，感觉很值！感谢携成的推荐，下次还会住这家","For the first time I lived in this hotel, I lived in Room C. Ctrip recommended that this hotel is cost -effective.The price of 380 yuan can be satisfied in this area. I feel very satisfied. Broadband free calls are not charged. Breakfast is OK.I have read the comments from netizens before that the front desk service is not satisfactory. This time I feel OK. I can basically be active and passionate. Personally, I think this is enough. Of course, if who is used to 5 -star service, it will definitely be disappointed here.With this budget, living in such a room, receiving such a service, it feels worth it!Thank you for your recommendation, I will live in this one next time"
0,不太好，晚上被卡拉OK的声音干扰到很晚。楼下的饭店也搞出很多污染。,"Not very good, I was interfered by the sound of karaoke at night.The restaurants downstairs also made a lot of pollution."
1,到达绍兴后，只要给这个客栈一个电话，十分钟之内就会有一辆小面的来接你，很方便。“老台门客栈”是由一家古老宅院改装的，三进的四合院两层木板瓦房，石板砌成的庭园，木头柱子立在鼓型石基上，木头窗户木头房门，开门和关门的时候会发出响亮的吱吱声，保持着古老纯朴的气息，院子里暗装了几个小音箱，不停顿低声播放江南丝竹乐，很有点气氛。清晨和黄昏只要你有兴趣，都可以坐在院子石凳上发发呆，或者找个对手在那张已经看不到原来油漆颜色的乒乓球桌上打打乒乓球。房间里为客人免费提供电脑可以上网，与现代信息时代挂上钩。干净清爽的床铺，热水和空调也陪备齐全，洗手间里有一体式的淋浴间。客栈提供免费的白米粥、油条等简单的早餐。客栈邻近鲁迅故里和咸亨酒店，走远一点还有沈园和仓前直街。,"After arriving in Shaoxing, as long as you call this inn, there will be a small noodle to pick you up within ten minutes, which is very convenient.""Laotai Gate Inn"" was modified by an ancient house.

1,"还算可以吧,住了两天,位置比较好,本来以为在古镇里会很吵,但是还好,干净/雅致,这是我对这个酒店评价(不过还有一点希望酒店改善:床铺太硬了,质量不敢恭维)如果有些朋友要在丽江待比较长的时间可以去""束河古镇""住一下,真的不错我的后几天都是在那过的,比较悠闲,酒店的质量绝对比丽江古镇的好.","It's okay. After two days of staying, the location is better. I thought it would be noisy in the ancient town, but fortunately, clean/elegant, this is my evaluation of this hotel (but there is a little hope that the hotel improves: the bed shop is too hardIt ’s not dare to compliment.) If some friends can go to“ Shuhe Ancient Town ”for a long time in Lijiang.It's better than the ancient town of Lijiang."
0,"楼很老,房间很大,服务不错.二楼的早茶不错.","The building is very old, the room is large, and the service is good. The morning tea on the second floor is good."
1,经常出差重庆，酒店都是公司预订好的，这次临时决定过去，就让那儿的朋友帮忙推荐。原本觉得随便找个有床睡的地方就好，对于服务、环境各方面没有任何的奢求。太意外了，君临给了我一个surprise。我是晚上到酒店的，还没有吃过晚饭，办好入住手续后，Waiter引导我到房间的时候和我拉家常，介绍酒店及附近怎么吃饭，介绍附近的交通，介绍如何在酒店里更好的享受生活……以往最让我郁闷的是住酒店经常网络不通，非得打几个电话和前台解释一通才能解决。但这次我进了房间，Waiter帮我连接电脑，确定网络可用后方才离开……太意外了，君临的细节、服务令我折服，国内我一直很推崇海尔所倡导的服务，但也只是平时媒体上看到的，移动的服务也很好，但我一般很少有空去对他们即时提供的服务作出简短的评价。此次却抽空做君临的评价，一是希望和我一样经常出差的朋友能有幸入住这样的酒店，感受宾至如归的感觉，享受生活；二是希望携程在各地多找些这样的酒店，让我们这些“飞人”有些归宿感；同时，也祝愿君临这样的酒店开得越来越好！,"Frequent travel in Chongqing, the hotel is booked by the company. This time, it is temporarily decided to go to the past and let my friends there help recommend it.Originally I felt that I would just find a place to sleep in bed, and there was no extravagance for all aspects of service and environment.It was too surprised that Junlin gave me a Surprise.I went to the hotel at night and had not had dinner yet. After checking in, Waiter guided me to go to the room with me, introducing how to eat hotels and nearby, introduce nearby transportation, introduce how to be better in the hotel in the hotel.Enjoying life ... The most depressed in the past is that the hotel often lives in the hotel, and I have to make a few calls and the front desk explanation to solve it.But this time I entered the room, and Waiter helped me connect the computer to determine that the network can be used before leaving ... Too surprised, the details and services of Junlin have made me.What I saw on the media, mobile services are also very good, but I generally have time to make a brief evaluation of their instant services.This time, I took the time to be the evaluation of Junlin. First, I hope that friends who often travel like me can be fortunate to enter such a hotel, feel the feelings of the guests, and enjoy life.""Flying Man"" has some sense of home; at the same time, I also wish a hotel like Junlin more and better!"
1,"整体来说感觉还是非常好的.,,宽带免费...服务还算不错...就是地方可能偏了一点...楼下没有出租车打...要出门自己打车麻烦了点...价格可以接受很合理....","Overall, it feels very good .,, broadband free ... The service is pretty good ... The place may be a little bit ... there is no taxi downstairs to fight ... it is troublesome to go out to take a taxi ... The price can be acceptable very reasonable ..."
0,1。我住的是靠马路的标准间。房间内设施简陋，并且的房间玻璃窗户外还有一层幕墙玻璃，而且不能打开，导致房间不能自然通风，采光不好。2。吃了三顿早餐，品种少得可怜。3。二楼餐厅被租出去了，价格特贵。原来订餐时告之房客可以打九折（房间服务指南里也明明白白写的，等到结帐时却告之海鲜和酒水是不能打折的，而且没有发票，找来经理才好不容易在第二天拿到发票。综合来说与四星级差距太大了！,"1.I live in the standard room of the road.The facilities in the room are simple, and the room glass windows also have a layer of curtain wall glass out of the room, and it cannot be opened, which causes the room to be unable to ventilate naturally, and the lighting is not good.2.After three breakfasts, the variety was so poor.3.The restaurant on the second floor was rented out, and the price was very expensive.It turned out that the tenants who told me the meal could be 10 % off (the room service guide was also clearly written in white, but when the checkout was at the checkout, the seafood and drinks could not be discounted, and there was no invoice.Get the invoice. The gap between the four -star level is too great!"
1,一句话：床太硬！一个晚上都没大睡好。喜欢软床的提醒大家一句，要有心里准备哦,"In a word: The bed is too hard!I didn't sleep well at night.Those who like a soft bed remind you, so you need to prepare in your heart"
1,大连很不错的酒店了，不过差点和南山花园那个搞错0.0,"Dalian is very good, but I almost made a mistake with Nanshan Garden 0.0"
1,酒店整体都不错，住过两次。感觉360跟410的房间没什么区别。,"The hotel is good as a whole, staying twice.It feels no difference between 360 and 410 rooms."
1,2月26日帮妈订的这个酒店，妈是3月2号离开的。妈说，这个酒店的性价比很高，房间很干净，可以免费宽带上网，价格也不错，服务态度非常不错。因为地处稍微有点偏僻，离店时，酒店服务人员很热情的询问是否要代叫出租；如果不用出租，门口还有公共汽车站，着实的很方便。不错，不错，竭力推荐！！！,"On February 26, the hotel booked by Mom, Mom left on March 2.Mom said that the hotel is very cost -effective, the room is very clean, you can go online for free, the price is good, and the service attitude is very good.Because it is a bit remote, when the store is left, the hotel service staff asked enthusiastically whether to be called rental; if you do n’t need to rent, there is a bus station at the door, which is really convenient.Yes, yes, I try to recommend it!IntersectionIntersection"
1,酒店的电视节目少.没有HBO....地毯极旧,There are few TV shows in the hotel. No HBO ... The carpet is extremely old
1,酒店有点旧，不知是什么时候建的，感觉远没5星标准房间跟三星酒店没太大区别，只是大了一点点而已服务还不错,The hotel is a bit old. I do n’t know when it was built. It feels far from the 5 -star standard room.
0,各方面都很一般，象个小旅店，也没什么太出格缺陷，价格略贵啊。,"It is very average in all aspects, like a small hotel, there is no extraordinary defect, and the price is slightly expensive."
1,住了一天，优惠大床房，房价很实惠，同样的价格这在这个地区基本是住不到的，就是房间稍微小了点，不过还是可以接受的，就是有点不太好，洗手间的一些设施安装的不是很好，卫生纸的位置太低，而且淋浴房的密封性较差，很容易漏水，虽然有些许的不足，但是不影响下次还会入住该酒店的想法，有机会还会住的，性价比很高宾馆反馈2008年8月4日：尊敬的客人您好，感谢您给予酒店的建议，我们将根据您的建议着手进行改进。如您在入住期间遇到任何问题可以联系总台及大堂经理，我们会在第一时间到您房间为您解决，真诚期待您的再次光临！,"After staying for a day, the large bed room, the house prices are very affordable. The same price is basically not available in this area, that is, the room is slightly smaller, but it is still acceptable.The installation is not very good, the location of the toilet paper is too low, and the shower room is less sealing, it is easy to leak water. Although it is a little short, it does not affect the idea of staying in the hotel next time., Available in the high -cost performance feedback on August 4, 2008: Dear guests, thank you for your suggestion to the hotel. We will start to improve according to your suggestions.If you encounter any problems during your stay, you can contact the head station and lobby manager, and we will solve you in your room as soon as possible, and sincerely look forward to your visit again!"
1,很不错的酒店。可能找起来稍微有一点麻烦，不过，在港澳码头就能看到很大的金龙酒店/娱乐城的标志，实际上就在金龙后面。服务很好，拿行李的服务生态度也特别好，可以顺便问下路。大堂可以兑换货币，换一些零钱可以方便乘车。最好问清到码头巴士的时间，一般是半点一班。房间也不错，面积不算小。插头转换器上一共有三个插头，所以，只要一个就基本都可以够充电了。如果硬要说有不足的话，就是离公交车站稍稍有一点路，大概1、200m左右。主要是澳门的巴士都不报站，所以容易乘过。第二次乘，坐到澳门旅游局或者金莲花广场后面一点那一站，就可以少走很多路。,"Very good hotel.It may be a little troublesome to find it, but you can see the sign of the Golden Dragon Hotel/Casino at the Hong Kong and Macao Wharf, which is actually behind the Golden Dragon.The service is very good, and the service of the luggage is also particularly good. You can ask the road by the way.The lobby can be exchanged for currency, and some change can be convenient to ride.It is best to ask the time to go to the dock bus, usually at all at all.The room is also good, and the area is not small.There are three plugs on the plug converter, so as long as one is basically enough to charge.If you want to say that there are insufficient, it is a little bit away from the bus station, about 1,200m.Mainly, the bus buses are not reported, so it is easy to take.For the second time, sit at the Macau Tourism Bureau or the Golden Lotus Plaza, you can take a lot less."
1,我住的是488的商务套间，房间很大，环境不错，服务也很热情，感觉值四星。早餐现在加了牛肉汤，味道不错。淮南现在有了按5星标准建的新锦江大酒店，下次去试试。,"I live in the 488 business suit. The room is large, the environment is good, the service is very enthusiastic, and I feel worth four stars.Breakfast is now added with beef soup, which tastes good.Huainan now has a new Jinjiang Hotel built according to the 5 -star standard. Let's try it next time."
0,其他没什么，就是房价便宜。很老的星级宾馆了，愧对4星的标准了。补充点评2008年5月31日：不过在安庆也就这家好一点，其他的要么很远，要么更差。,"There is nothing else, but house prices are cheap.A very old star hotel, ashamed the standard of 4 stars.Supplementary comment on May 31, 2008: But in Anqing, this one is better, and the others are either far away or worse."
0,缺点：服务员太少，忙的时候能排大队，用餐需要出酒店到外面吃，索性还不如不提供早餐呢，房间狭小，卫生纸供应不充足。优点：交通方便。,"Disadvantages: There are too few waiters. When you are busy, you can line up a team. You need to go out to eat outside the hotel. It ’s better not to provide breakfast. The room is small and the supply of toilet paper is insufficient.Advantages: convenient transportation."
1,酒店最好之处是离世纪公园地铁站3号出口步行约4分钟，隔壁就有一家湘菜馆，我住这酒店住了六天，就在这菜馆吃了六天，价格不算贵，约60元/3菜。而且旁边有俩间超市，和1家清真牛肉面馆6块/碗。我住的是大床房，340元包双早。令我特感动的是周日我起晚了，九点去吃早点时，（早餐7点到9点半）已经没有饺子了，有个男员工马上帮我们煮了两碗，吃得我心特暖，因为很有人情味啊！,"The best thing about the hotel is about 4 minutes by exit from the No. 3 of Century Park Metro Station. There is a Hunan restaurant next door. I stayed in this hotel for six days. I ate it in this restaurant for six days. The price was not expensive.60 yuan/3 dishes.And there are two supermarkets next to them, 6 yuan/bowl of a halal beef noodle restaurant.I live in a large bed room, 340 yuan bags in the early morning.What moved me was that I got up late on Sunday. When I went to eat early at 9 o'clock, there was no dumplings at 7:00). A male employee immediately cooked two bowls and ate my heart.It's warm, because it is very human!"
0,酒店前台的态度极其恶劣，我预定的是12月14日晚的双人间，携程预定是到晚上9点，由于行程改变，到达时间会推后，因为该酒店当天有一个全省会议，考虑到房间可能会紧张，所以在当晚8点前打电话到酒店前台，告知我会晚到，房间请保留，前台的答复是可以，当晚我9点30分到达酒店，前台告诉我过了预定的9点钟，房间已经取消，并且也没有房间了，还拿出携程的预定传真给我看，我说我已经事先电话告知会晚到并且已得到你们的承诺，现在房间取消竟然认为是我的责任，吵了半天来了一个大堂经理，上来又是同样的一堆废话，最后说只能给我一个大床间加一张床，没办法只能接受，对此事件非常遗憾，同时对于携程与这种酒店签订协议也很失望！,"The attitude of the hotel's front desk is extremely harsh. I booked a double room on the evening of December 14. Ctrip is scheduled to be at 9 pm. Due to the changes in the itinerary, the arrival time will be pushed back.The room may be nervous, so I called the hotel front desk before 8:00 that night and told me that I would arrive late. Please keep the room. The answer in the front desk was okay. I arrived at the hotel at 9:30 that night.At a time, the room has been canceled, and there is no room. I also took out Ctrip's booking faxes to me. I said that I had called in advance that it would be late and got your promise.After a long time, there was a lobby manager, and there was the same bunch of nonsense up. Finally, I could only add a bed to me in a large bed. There was no way to accept it.This hotel signing agreement is also disappointed!"
1,酒店档次很高，环境很优越，在香港还是算很不错的一家酒店,The hotel has a high grade and the environment is superior. It is still a very good hotel in Hong Kong.
0,就住了两天，第一天晚上就发现了一只大小强。第二天下午回来让服务员喷了药，早上起来发现了一只殉职的小小强。早餐没有牛奶，勉强可以吃几片廉价的面包，喝点豆浆，冲的果珍，白粥。别的反正我都不感兴趣。房间临街，晚上剧吵，幸好俺睡得比较死。,"I lived for two days, and a strong size was found on the first night.The next afternoon came back to let the waiter spray the medicine, and got up in the morning and found a dying Xiaoqiang.There is no milk for breakfast. You can barely eat a few pieces of cheap bread, drink soy milk, flush fruit, white porridge.I am not interested anyway.The room was on the street, and the drama was noisy at night. Fortunately, I slept more."
1,位置不错，如果到火车东站和美国领事馆签证处都是走路的距离，很方便。,"The location is good. If you go to the East Railway Station and the U.S. Consulate's visa, it is very convenient."
0,是我遇到的最差的4星酒店，进门没人管，进去要我和大堂打招呼，退房也很慢，不会再去住了,It is the worst 4 -star hotel I encountered. No one cares about it when I enter the door. I go in and ask me to say hello to the lobby.
1,还不错，在市中心了，价格实惠，还有免费的接机，服务也很好，不过因为酒店可能时间长了，设施不是很新，但是还可以。,"Not bad, in the city center, the price is affordable, there are free pick -up, the service is also very good, but because the hotel may be long, the facilities are not new, but it is okay."
0,1.诚信有问题的酒店。在前台问价格比网上订便宜多了，然后，知道你是网上订的，就马上改口，然后一定要你用网上的价格结算（由于网上订是用信用卡担保的，没办法），结果，就被坑了。2.房间的蚊子挺多的。3.温泉没怎么清洁，早上8：00去泡，刚换的水，还是很脏，不明白为何人那么少，还那么脏；温泉的设施与开平、阳江比，只能说是落后10年了；4.温泉在山边，空气不错。5.餐厅还行，早点做得不错，与外的几间大排档比，价格上也很接近，在餐厅吃也不错。补充点评2007年10月7日：少说了一点：6.酒店没有POS机，不接受信用卡，这非常少见。,"1. Hotels with problems with integrity.Ask the price at the front desk is much cheaper than the Internet, and then, if you know that you are booked online, you will change your mouth immediately, and then you must settle it with online prices (because the online order is guaranteed with a credit card, there is no way).It's pitted.2. There are a lot of mosquitoes in the room.3. The hot springs are not very clean, soak in the morning at 8:00 in the morning. The water just changed is still very dirty. I don’t understand why there are so few and so dirty.4. The hot spring is on the mountain, the air is good.5. The restaurant is okay. It is good to do it early. Compared with the a few outside stalls, the price is very close, and it is also good to eat in the restaurant.Supplementary comment on October 7, 2007: Say less: 6. The hotel does not have POS machines and does not accept credit cards. This is very rare."
1,"虽是观景房,不过我住的楼层太低(19楼)看不到江景,但地点很好,离轻轨临江门站和较场口站(起点)很近,解放碑就在附近(大约100多公尺吧)!","Although it is an observation room, the floor I live in is too low (19th floor) to see Jiang Jing, but the location is very good.About 100 meters)!"
1,在四川广元，这种酒店算不错了，在当地也是最好的了。早餐也很丰富。不足在于房间地毯太旧，房间隔音效果也不是很好。,"In Guangyuan, Sichuan, this hotel is good, and it is also the best in the local area.Breakfast is also very rich.The disadvantage is that the room carpet is too old, and the sound insulation effect of the room is not very good."
1,"还好了,房间的窗户是不能打开的,电梯要刷卡才能上楼,保安性不错.这个酒店我住过很多次了,可以肯定的是挂二星的牌,并不是携程网所显示的三星级酒店.","Fortunately, the windows of the room cannot be opened. The elevator must swipe the card to go upstairs. The security is good. I have lived in this hotel many times. It is certain that the card of the two -star is not sure.Grade hotel."
1,住过好多次这家酒店了，上次来到前台，服务员能准确的报出我的名字，感觉很亲切。四星级就是不一样。而且当天服务员还给我安排了一间商务单间，房间很新，比我订的要好价格没变。说是酒店搞活动，像我们这样的商务客人都有机会享受，不错。,"I have lived many times this hotel. Last time I came to the front desk, the waiter could accurately report my name and feel very kind.The four -star is different.And the waiter also arranged a business single room on that day. The room was very new, and the price was better than me.It is said that business guests like us have the opportunity to enjoy, which is good."
0,可能是周总理住过房间比较朴素陈设与服务简单不过早餐丰盛,"It may be that Premier Zhou has lived in the room relatively simple furnishings and services, but breakfast is rich"
0,迷你房还真是迷你啊……家具和墙纸都旧的不行，但还都齐全。虽然地方还满难找的，不过叫车倒是满方便的。房间隔音很差。总之，对不起这个价格，还不如去如家之类的。,"The mini room is really a mini ... furniture and wallpaper are not old, but they are still complete.Although the place is still difficult to find, it is convenient to call a car.The room's sound insulation is poor.In short, I'm sorry for this price, it is better to go to the family."
1,"服务绝对温馨,深夜入住,上楼出电梯的时候竟然还有服务员笑脸相迎,送进房间,铺好床铺道声晚安,感觉好亲切!早上起床用餐,服务也绝对可以,以后还会去住,只是酒店设施方面可以在上一个层次!","The service is absolutely warm, staying in late at night, when you go upstairs to go out of the elevator, there are still waiters to meet each other with a smile, send it to the room, and pave the bed and go well. It feels good! When you get up in the morning for dinner, the service is definitely possible., But the hotel facilities can be at the previous level!"
1,地理位置不错，离大型购物中心不远，性价比非常高，每次来大连都住这里,"The geographical location is good, not far from large shopping malls, and the cost performance is very high. Every time I come to Dalian, I live here"
1,澳门本来就小所以地理位置没什么好说的所有码头都有开往各大酒店的巴士这间酒店大堂还可以房间一般而且没什么景观可言里面的菲佣招待好像听不懂普通话只懂粤语和英文.我倒是看见渔人码头里有一家新开的白色建筑酒店西式的英文名叫Rocks&Hotel面对大海和大桥.想必还是不错的.有意向的朋友可以一查.,"Macau was originally small, so there is nothing to say about the geographical location. All the docks that are driving to major hotels.I saw that there was a newly opened white building hotel in the Western -style Western name Rocks & Hotel in the Fisherman's Wharf facing the sea and bridge. Presumably, it was still good. Interested friends could check it."
1,地理位置优越，临近步行街和长沙的酒吧一天街，出去玩非常方便。房间空间还不错，早餐马马虎虎,"The geographical location is superior. It is very convenient to go out to play with the bar and Changsha.The room space is not bad, breakfast is sloppy"
1,入住了大王阁。每个房间都有个阳台，本人入住的房间，一拉开窗帘“我的天啊，就是一座山！！！”早晨醒来的感觉很好，鸟语花香啊^^。但是酒店早上的早餐不是很好，每天的内容都差不多。午餐晚餐需要去旧楼餐厅，因为宾馆依山而建的关系，用餐都要走到最底层，给人的感觉都是在地下室。有提供30元/人的套餐，感觉还可以。最要提醒的是，各位要特别注意宾馆的保险箱，本人房间的保险箱差一点就要采取极端方式打开:P,"Check in Datang Pavilion.There is a balcony in each room. The room I stayed in, opened the curtain, ""My God is a mountain !!!"" I felt good when I woke up in the morning, bird language ^^.But the hotel's breakfast in the morning is not very good, and the content of every day is almost the same.Lunch and dinner need to go to the old building restaurant. Because the hotel is built on the mountain, the dining must be at the bottom, and the feeling is in the basement.There are sets of 30 yuan/person, it feels okay.The most important thing to remind is that you should pay special attention to the safe of the hotel. The safe of my room must be opened in an extreme way: P"
1,"设备较老,空调不好用,说好下午两点退房,结果我一点回房间时门就打不开,到前台后前台直接把房卡就收了,反而又让我跑到房间等着服务员帮忙开门拿行李,感觉很不尊重客人,唯一可取的就是离星海广场近了,订的是海景房只能看到15度角的海啊!","The equipment is older, the air conditioner is not easy to use. After two o'clock in the afternoon, I will check out at two in the afternoon.The waiter helped to open the door to get his luggage. He felt very disrespectful to the guests. The only thing that could be taken was that it was close to Xinghai Plaza. The sea view room could only see the sea of 15 degrees!"
0,“十一”开车去的。在宾馆接线员的热情引领下，较容易地找到了它。然而，进入房间后，一切都变了：房间只有一楼的，电视遥控没有的，空调不是全天的，电话拿起不通的，询问服务小姐一问三不知的，旅游咨询是空的，住了三天两夜是一尘不变的。不过，宾馆餐厅的菜好象比外面的土菜馆烹饪得好一些，但是价格……不作评论！下次再也不去喽！,"""Eleven"" drove.Under the enthusiasm of the hotel leaders, it was easier to find it.However, after entering the room, everything has changed: the room is only on the first floor, the TV remote control is not available, the air conditioner is not all day, the phone is unable to pick up, and ask the service service to ask the three unknown.Three days and two nights are unchanged.However, the restaurant in the hotel is better than cooking better than the local restaurants outside, but the price ... do not comment!I won't go again next time!"
1,在上海市中心的位置，因此比较牛气。不过在周围几个酒店里性价比算高的了，大床房难订到。,"In the center of Shanghai, it is more bullish.However, the cost -effectiveness of the surrounding hotels is high, and it is difficult to order in the big bed room."
1,服务很好！员工很礼貌！房间很干净就是小了点！房间不能直接通话，需要总机转，不方便！在我看来：只能是准四星级酒店，在黄山只能算三星级酒店！,"The service was excellent!Employees are polite!The room is very clean, but it is a bit small!The room cannot be called directly, and the header is required, which is inconvenient!In my opinion: it can only be a quasi -four -star hotel, and it can only be regarded as a three -star hotel in Huangshan!"
1,整体不错，性价比较高。没有啥特色，从房间到周围环境以及服务，只能用“标准”俩字形容。38的自助餐有些不值。,"The overall is good, and the cost is relatively high.There is no characteristic. From the room to the surrounding environment and services, it can only be described in the word ""standard"".The 38 buffet is worthless."
1,我是7/24晚上22时入住的1603商务大床房之后换至1611房，在过程中发现酒店优缺点都存在，以下简要说明：缺点：1、1603房马桶上有毛发。可能由于我本身做的就是酒店行业，对这方面特别挑剔吧！通知客房部后马上来人清理。2、1603房防盗链无法正常使用。这可是安全问题，希望酒店引起重视！通知前厅部马上换房至1611.3、1611房床单上有未洗干净的血迹。床单是清洗过，但是没有清洗干净的床单不应该铺上床！通知客房部更换床单。4、1611房间浴室淋浴水太小。自己克服。5、25日晚在锦绣江南餐厅用餐在一盘清炒芦笋中发现一根头发。之后退货，餐厅付经理以两份水果表示歉意。优点：1、前厅部服务员态度非常好，对于以上问题的发生不停的表示歉意，害得我都不好意思！呵呵！2、地理位置不错，就是附近餐饮店太少。3、客房部、礼宾部员工态度也很不错，始终有微笑在脸上。让人感觉舒服！综合上述：下次去烟台还会住中心大酒店。补充点评2008年7月31日：建议酒店可以把在携程上的照片更新以下了，房间的照片显得好陈旧！其实16楼的房间装修的很时髦呀！宾馆反馈2008年8月1日：尊敬的客人：您好！非常感谢您提出的宝贵意见！对于本次在入住期间给您带来的不便，我们深感不安，说明我们的工作还有很多不到位之处。对于您反馈的情况，我们非常重视并将通过努力持续改进工作，使每一位客人在入住期间愉快、舒适！同时非常感谢并您对房间图片的建议，并予采纳，对此您本人将获得下次酒店入住一次免费升级体验的机会。再次感谢您对酒店的建议！,"I was changed to room 1611 after I stayed at the 1603 business bedroom at 22 pm at 7/24. During the process, I found that the advantages and disadvantages of the hotel exist. The following brief explanations: Disadvantages: There are hair on the toilet 1,1603 room.Maybe because what I do is the hotel industry, it is particularly picky about this!After notifying the guest room, come to the house to clean up immediately.2. The 1603 room anti -theft chain cannot be used normally.This is a security issue, I hope the hotel will attract attention!The front hall was notified to change the house to 1611.3, 1611 room sheets with unwashed blood stains.The sheets have been cleaned, but the sheets that are not cleaned should not be put on the bed!Notify the rooms to change the sheets.4, 1611 room bathroom shower water is too small.Overcome yourself.On the evening of the 25th, a meal was found in a plate of fried asparagus in a plate of fried asparagus in the splendid Jiangnan restaurant.After returning the goods, the restaurant's manager apologized with two fruits.Advantages: 1. The waiter in the front hall department is very good. I apologize to the above problems. I am embarrassed!hehe!2. The geographical location is good, that is, there are too few nearby restaurants.3. The employees of the guest room department and the ceremony department are also very good, and there are always smiles on their faces.It makes people feel comfortable!Based on the above: Next time I go to Yantai, I will stay in the center of the center.Supplementary comment on July 31, 2008: It is recommended that hotels can update the photos on Ctrip, and the photos of the rooms are so old!In fact, the room on the 16th floor is very fashionable!Hotel feedback on August 1, 2008: Dear guest: Hello!Thank you very much for your precious opinions!We are deeply disturbed about the inconvenience brought to you during this stay, indicating that there are still many things in our work.For your feedback, we attach great importance to and will continue to improve work through hard work, so that every guest will be happy and comfortable during the check -in!At the same time, thank you very much for your suggestions on the room pictures and adopt it. In this regard, you will get the opportunity to take a free upgrade experience for the next hotel.Thank you again for your suggestion to the hotel!"
0,"不能当时提供发票,说给邮寄,现在还没有收到发票,感觉被欺骗了",I couldn't provide an invoice at that time.
1,宾馆虽然比较老，房间感觉还可以，服务很好，早餐品种少了点。打车起步价到海边。走路15分钟到好又多超市。在开发区里面出差住在这里很方便。,"Although the hotel is older, the room feels okay, the service is good, and the breakfast varieties are a bit less.The starting price of a taxi is to the seaside.Walking 15 minutes to good and more supermarkets.It is convenient to live here in the development zone."
1,总体感觉不错呢，房间干净整洁，性价比高。美中不足就是打扫时间长了点儿哦,"The overall feels good, the room is clean and tidy, and the price is high.Insufficient beauty is that the cleaning time is a bit long"
1,还不错，有水果送，房内有电脑，而且早餐还可以，房间比较大，水龙头旁有饮水龙头，基本还是很满意的,"It's not bad, there are fruits, there are computers in the room, and breakfast is okay. The room is relatively large. There is a faucet next to the faucet, which is basically very satisfactory."
0,设施不是一般的差，就是一个招待所。我的毛巾挂在卫生间，等要用的时候，竟然发现上面爬了臭虫。只能把它扔了。餐厅价格也高，一个大葱炒鸡蛋要25元，其他菜可以推想。地段倒是不错，服务态度也还可以，还能够全程刷卡。,"The facility is not a general difference, or a guest house.My towel hangs in the bathroom. When I want to use it, I found a bug climbing on it.You can only throw it away.The price of the restaurant is also high. A scallion fried egg costs 25 yuan. Other dishes can be pushed.The location is good, the service attitude is okay, and you can swipe the card throughout the process."
1,房间还算干净。环境也不错。设施什么的也不错。可是晚上发现没大灯，就一台灯，黑乎乎的。而且最后走的时候说床单弄脏了要了20元清洗费用。我想知道难道床单都不清洗的吗？只有脏了才清洗？？？？？？？？？？？？？？,"The room is quite clean.The environment is also good.The facilities are also good.But when there was no headlight at night, there was a lamp, which was dark.And when I finally left, I said that the sheets were soiled for 20 yuan.I want to know that the sheets are not cleaned?Washing it only if it is dirty?IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersection"
1,果然如同其他会员们所说的：位置优越，但不太好找。让我体会了一把京城小胡同的韵味。周围还是在拆迁。酒店感觉较温馨，要是能够在每个房间里都放上吹风机就好了。还是值得向朋友们推荐的。,"Sure enough, as other members said: the location is superior, but it is not easy to find.Let me appreciate the charm of a small lady in Beijing.The surroundings are still demolition.The hotel feels more warm. If you can put a hair dryer in each room.It is still worth recommending to friends."
1,豪华阁的客房和普通客房差距较大，普通客房都显得比较陈旧，经常听说外国客人遇到房间免费升级，中国人倒是没有遇到过！,The gap between the guest rooms of the luxury cabinet and the ordinary rooms is large. Ordinary rooms are relatively old. I often heard that foreign guests have been upgraded for free rooms. The Chinese have never encountered it!
1,酒店的位置很不错，豪华大床间物超所值，竟然有会客区、衣帽间，简直是一间小套房。但是酒店的服务不太到位，早上的早餐点很久都上不来，有待改进。宾馆反馈2008年8月1日：感谢您对我们的肯定及宝贵意见，对您的意见西餐厅已进行了改进。从8月份开始西餐厅还推出了清凉下午茶、夜茶、商务简餐及精品套餐，还有很多饮品、酒水赠送；快来体验哦`！,"The location of the hotel is very good. The luxury large bed is worth it. There is a guest area and a cloakroom, which is a small suite.However, the service of the hotel is not in place. The breakfast in the morning can not come up for a long time, and it needs to be improved.Hotel feedback on August 1, 2008: Thank you for your affirmation and valuable opinions, and have improved your opinion Western restaurant.Since August, Western Restaurant has also launched cool afternoon tea, night tea, business simple meals and boutique packages. There are also many drinks and drinks. Come and experience it!"
1,1、酒店位于南湖旁边，再过去就是惠州西湖，订的湖景房能看到南湖的一角，总的来说离汽车站较近，容易找到；2、通过前台办理手续还是比较快，能很快查到网上预约的登记，服务质量不错，结帐时忘了点东西在客房，结果结帐时发现后马上送下来了；3、房间隔音效果确实不怎么样，半夜能听到隔壁的动静；4、价格优势不大，网上预订价格和前台价格相差只有20元，价格优势不明显，而且不是靠西湖，如果价格再优惠一些可能竞争力更大；,"1. The hotel is located next to Nanhu. In the past, Huizhou West Lake. The booked lake view room can see the corner of the South Lake. In general, it is closer to the bus station and it is easy to find.Quickly check the registration of online appointments. The quality of service is good. I forgot something in the guest room when checking out. As a result, I was delivered immediately after the checkout.4. The price advantage is not large. The price difference between the online booking price and the front desk is only 20 yuan. The price advantage is not obvious, and it is not relying on West Lake."
1,补充：大堂服务的人员太少，感觉不太像四星级酒店，早餐78一位，不知道是不是搞错，记得午餐只有38,Supplement: There are too few people in the lobby service. It feels like a four -star hotel. There are 78 breakfast. I don’t know if it is wrong. Remember that there is only 38 lunch
1,"还好了!朋友建议入住的酒店,可以接受了,有机会会尝试其他酒店对比",Fortunately! Friends suggest that the hotel where you stay can be accepted. If you have the opportunity to try other hotel comparisons
1,前台接待服务太差，去前台办手续的时候爱理不理的，，我住的是3栋，不跟前台一栋房子，很难找，也没服务员带过去，不过房间和环境还可以，空气很好！！,"The front desk reception service is too bad. When I go to the front desk to handle the procedures, I ignore it. I live in 3 buildings. I do n’t find a house with the front desk.,L!Intersection"
1,很老的四星级酒店，虽然各方面依稀还能感受到昔日作为涉外酒店的规模，但设备的极度老旧已经是无法隐藏的遗憾了。尽管如此，酒店的服务很贴心，应对也很热情，可能是靠服务态度来弥补上述的不足吧！我住了两个晚上，酒店连续两天送给我水果拼盘，不愧是温带水果出名的山东，梨、苹果、毛桃都非常美味。还会考虑入住。只是济南本身的景点真是太少了！,"The very old four -star hotel, although it can still feel the size of the past as a foreign -related hotel in all aspects, the extreme regret of the extreme of equipment is already an unable to hide.Nevertheless, the hotel's service is very intimate and the response is also very enthusiastic. It may be to make up for the shortcomings of the above!I lived for two nights, and the hotel gave me a fruit platter for two consecutive days. It is indeed Shandong, which is famous for temperate fruit, and pears, apples and peaches are very delicious.You will also consider check -in.It's just that there are too few attractions in Jinan itself!"
1,"房间很大,床很舒服。有个天井,很奇怪,影响手机信号。早餐一般般,应该还能更好些。","The room is very large and the bed is very comfortable.There is a patio, which is strange and affects mobile phone signals.Breakfast is generally better."
0,硬件顶多3星半，大堂黑咕隆咚的，房间很小也没特点。管家部的服务倒是挺好，有求必应的。,"The hardware is at most 3 stars, and the lobby is dark, and the room is small and has no characteristics.The service of the housekeeper is very good, and it must be responding."
1,"硬,服人切,但地略偏,美中不足.短期停留可湛江地首.然五星酒店水尚有些微差距,但整已具此血,景可期.","Hard, taking people cut, but the ground is slightly biased, the beauty is not enough. In the short -term stay, the land of Zhanjiang can be used. The water of the five -star hotel is still slightly different, but it has this blood, the scene can be expected."
1,酒店环境不错，房间的设施及其他服务也很到位。问题有这样几个，其一，酒店前台接待效率太低，入住接待仅为一人，在比较忙的时候其他四个服务员即使空着也只是傻看。其二，酒店提供给我的浴巾有很明显的汗味，当然，我们可以谅解是天气的原因，但这样的天气是不是更应该做好这方面的清洗工作，虽然稍后和他们反映后立即给我送了两条干净的，但对留在房里的两条有异味的浴巾酒店显得丝毫不在意。其三，所谓这样的高级酒店，中餐厅的味道还算不错的，虽然价格高些，但好在品质还是有保证，但早餐实在令人觉得差距太夸张，和酒店的服务天壤之别，不但味道有待好好改善，添菜的速度也应该好好管理一下了，虽然早上人多，菜吃的快，但我看到的几乎都是空盘，况且早餐时间是7.00-9.30，我8点多久已经这样的情况，那9点去的客人岂不是看空盘子吃饭了。综上所述，酒店虽然总体还是不错的，但有些方面还是应该注意自己的细节。如果从我个人来说，如果再去恐龙园，也不愿意再入住你们的酒店的。个人觉得住市中心可能来的更实惠，距离也不算远，打车也就20块左右了。,"The hotel environment is good, and the facilities and other services in the room are also in place.There are a few problems. First, the hotel's front desk reception efficiency is too low, and the reception of the hotel is only one person. When he is busy, the other four waiters are just stupid even if they are empty.Second, the bath towel provided by the hotel has obvious sweat. Of course, we can understand the cause of the weather, but should this weather be better to clean up in this regard?I gave me two clean, but I didn't care about the two odors in the room.Third, the so -called high -end hotels have a good taste of Chinese restaurants. Although the price is higher, but the quality is still guaranteed, but the breakfast is really exaggerated.The taste needs to be improved well, and the speed of adding vegetables should also be managed. Although there are many people in the morning and the vegetables are eating fast, I see almost all of the empty disks. BesidesIn this case, wouldn't the guests go at 9 o'clock watching the empty plate for dinner.In summary, although the hotel is generally good, some aspects should still pay attention to their details.If I personally, if I go to the dinosaur garden, I don't want to stay in your hotel again.Personally, I think that the city center may come more affordable, and the distance is not far away, and the taxi is about 20 yuan."
1,酒店是5星级，但是感觉硬件上离5星还有那么一点差距，服务很好，性价比还是很高的。入住当天酒店的电脑系统出了问题，直到下午才办理了入住，但是酒店人员态度很好，很有耐心。我住的行政大床间，房间有一处设计比较奇怪，就是淋浴间和床只隔了一道透明玻璃，洗澡时从卫生间外面看得非常清楚......要是一个人住还好，我和我女朋友一起住的，弄得我们洗澡都不好意思用淋浴，只好在浴盆洗。不知道其他房间是不是这样。总的来说，考虑到价格因素的话名人酒店还是很不错的，下次来南京还会住这里。,"The hotel is a 5 -star, but there is still a little gap between the 5 -star on the hardware. The service is very good, and the cost performance is still very high.There was a problem with the hotel system of the hotel on the day of staying, and it was not until the afternoon that it was processed, but the hotel staff attitude was very good and patient.There is a strange design room in the administrative bed in the administrative bed, that is, the shower room and the bed are only separated from a transparent glass. It is very clear from the bathroom when I take a bath ... If a person lives alone, meI lived with my girlfriend, so I was embarrassed to take a bath with a shower, so I had to wash it in the bathtub.I don't know if other rooms are like this.In general, the celebrity hotel is still very good to consider the price factor. Next time I come to Nanjing, I will live here."
1,我是开会带住宿的，住的商务房，新装修的，还可观赏滨河大道的夜景，挺舒服！另外会议室也有好几个，选择还是蛮多的！,"I have a meeting with accommodation. I live in a business house and newly renovated. I can also watch the night view of Binhe Avenue, which is very comfortable!In addition, there are several conference rooms, and there are quite a lot of choices!"
1,环境好，周边景色优美；服务好，没到时间进不了房间，提前给了牌子，玩了乐园归来不再需要排队，退房不用办手续。酒店设施好，房间风格很优美，房间比较宽敞，床大，内饰不错。不足是酒店饮食不习惯，进房时间太晚（下午3点后），没法到房间先整理，退房时间太早，乐园出来没地方休息。,"The environment is good, the surrounding scenery is beautiful; the service is good, I can't enter the room without time. I gave the sign in advance. I no longer need to line up after playing the parking park.The hotel facilities are good, the room style is very beautiful, the room is relatively spacious, the bed is large, and the interior is good.The shortcoming is that the hotel is not used to the diet. The time for entering the room is too late (after 3 pm), you ca n’t go to the room first. The check -out time is too early. There is no place to rest in the park."
1,10月底刚住了3天，感觉真的不错，房间够大，很干净，虽然靠街，隔音效果还算不错，至少我住的时候服务态度很好，让拿个吹风机很快就拿来了，拿几包茶叶也很快，唯一的遗憾就是不提供信用卡消费，不过在门口就有一个自动提款机，还有不能延后一小时退房，说是电脑系统问题。总体感觉230一间很好。,"I just lived for 3 days at the end of October. I feel really good. The room is big enough and clean. Although the street is on the street, the sound insulation effect is pretty good. At least I live in a good service attitude.It is also fast to take a few packs of tea. The only regret is that it does not provide credit card consumption, but there is an automatic withdrawal machine at the door, and it cannot be postponed to check out for an hour, saying that it is a computer system problem.Overall feels 230 a good room."
1,说说我的经历吧我打电话给中信银行信用卡说要订房间他们给我推荐了汉园说里市中心很近预定成功了到了徐州问了出租车司机才知道原来汉园很偏僻就打电话退了换了这家10钟后就短信提示预定成功晚8.50打出租车去的被出租车司机绕路他把我一直拉到矿务局跟司机吵架气下车那地方很偏僻没出租车打电话给金陵金源大酒店前台我说我定了你们的酒店迷路了前台MM给我转到礼宾部GG接的电话问了我周围的建筑物特征和我的衣着特征大概10钟后一辆出租车来把我拉到酒店到的时候我给钱他说酒店已经给了感动…………门童主动开车门提我拿包我说不用了他坚持帮我拿其实没什么重东西就一个旅行小背包入住登记用了很长时间原因是我的信用卡销磁了换了一张信用卡才刷成功的房间不错很精致让人有种回家的感觉很温馨27号是我的生日其实我是忘了的因为我们那里过生日过的是阴历的不过阳历的一早银行发信息给我祝我生日快乐我才想起是我的生日下午和朋友出去玩很晚才回酒店21点服务员来敲门还有礼宾部的经理带着水果小蛋糕贺卡小荷包来给我过生日那时我真的很感动我是过完18岁生日去了日本在日本4年没过一次生日这是我回国后地一次过生日总的来说这家酒店的服务达到了5+星的标准硬件离5星还有点距离但对于出门在外的人最重要的还是回家的感觉顺便说下这家酒店的MM很不错个个水灵灵的一楼餐厅的MM老是冲我微笑笑得我浑身不自在浑身痒痒的小弟我今年才22岁还没谈女朋友哪里经得起如此MM对我微笑啊,"Tell me about my experience. I called CITIC Bank's credit card and said that they wanted to book a room. They recommended me to Hanyuan and said that the city center of Licheng was very close to the city center. After being successful, I asked the taxi driver to know that Hanyuan was very remote and called.After returning to this one after 10 minutes, the text message prompts that the taxi driver will be detoured by the taxi driver to the taxi.The front desk of Jinling Jinyuan Hotel I said that I set my hotel to get lost. The front desk MM transferred me to the GG answered by the ritual department.When the car came to the hotel, I gave him money. He said that the hotel had been moved ................ Door Tong took the initiative to drive the door and asked me. I said no.The reason for the backpack is for a long time. The reason for a long time is that my credit card was sold magnetic. I changed a credit card before swiping the successful room.Because of our birthday, the lunar calendar was in the lunar calendar, but in the early morning of the solar calendar, the bank sent me a happy birthday. I remembered that I went out to play with my friends in the afternoon in the afternoon.The manager of the department brought the fruit cake card and the small lotus bag for me to give me a birthday. At that time, I was really touched that I was going to Japan for 18 years.Generally speaking, the service of this hotel has reached 5+ stars. The standard hardware is a bit far away from 5 stars, but the most important thing for people who go out are to go home By the way, the MM of this hotel is very good.The mm of the dining room on the first floor of Ling always smiled at me and smiled so much that I was uncomfortable with myself. I was only 22 years old and I haven't talked about my girlfriend."
1,环境还可以，房间不大但也不是太小，够住了。写字桌前的落地灯离得太近了，每次移椅子都会碰到，另外有一点就是隔音效果不好，夜间车子路过的声音有点吵，其它的还行。,"The environment is okay. The room is not big but not too small.The floor lamp in front of the writing table is too close, and every time you move the chair, you will touch it. Another thing is that the sound insulation effect is not good. The sound of passing by the car at night is a bit noisy, and the others are okay."
1,"非常好的酒店,除了前台的服务态度.房间设施非常好,飞利浦的液晶彩电,还有电脑备用.只是,可能因为是通过携程预定而非直接预定的原因,房间的位置非常差.","Very good hotel, in addition to the service attitude of the front desk. The room facilities are very good. The LCD color TV in Philips and computer are available. However, it may be because it is booked through Ctrip rather than direct reservations. The location of the room is very poor."
1,位置不错，去海滨浴场挺方便的，就是房费有点高。门口的出租车不好打，最好往北出了口再打车。服务很好，态度不错。,"The location is good, it is very convenient to go to the seaside bath, that is, the cost of the house is a bit high.The taxi at the door is not good, it is best to get out of the north and take a taxi.The service is very good and the attitude is good."
0,告知所有的朋友，这个酒店，简直就是一个黑店1，一楼大堂吃饭，白水5块一杯。2。小卖部里的东西，市场5-8倍。3，深夜12点有色情电话。转天问服务员，他们说是一楼的美发，和他们没关系。奉劝各位千万不要入住。,"Tell all friends, this hotel is simply a black shop 1, the lobby on the first floor, and 5 pieces of white water.2.In the small sales department, the market is 5-8 times.3. There are porn calls at 12 o'clock in the middle of the night.The waiter who turned to the sky, they said that it was the hairdressing on the first floor, and it had nothing to do with them.I advise you not to stay."
1,"订家庭间入住的是虹口商务酒店,因为到达之后临时改订单,与前台小姐发生了点不愉快,但之后的客房服务以及入住房间的物超所值大大弥补了之前的不快,总的来说,很不错","The Hongkou Business Hotel is settled between the family. Because the order was temporarily changed after arriving, it was a bit unpleasant to the front desk lady, but the later guest room service and the value of money in the room were greatly made up for the previous unhappiness. Generally speaking, in general, it is generally.very nice"
1,很好的酒店，紧靠海边，除了入住当晚网络不好，其他都很满意，对了也还有一点出来打车不容易，不过走出路口这段路风景也不错，呵呵。,"A very good hotel, close to the seaside. In addition to the poor network on the night of staying, others are very satisfied. By the way, it is not easy to get out of the car, but the road scenery is also good to walk out of the road."
0,一定一定不能去住，理由如下1、管理不善，服务质量极差。我定了佰富酒店3天的房间，第二天（未到结帐时间）没有找到钥匙卡，向前台咨询该怎么办，前台先没有提供任何建议，第一句就是要求我赔偿钥匙卡50元的现金，当时气结；这还不算，当天早晨服务员帮我重做了钥匙卡，结果打不开门，我上上下下来回换了3次新的钥匙卡，还是打不开，服务员说尽快帮我解决问题，我因为当时赶时间，就先走了，可是到晚上6点多钟回来，新的钥匙卡依然打不开房门，后来交涉换房，值班经理和前厅经理一直躲着不见，为换房耽误了我将近1个小时的时间；和我一起的同事跟我同时入住佰富，住了两晚上，此期间直到第三天结帐离开房间，都没有服务员帮忙收拾过房间！2、隔音效果极差，旁边工地施工打扰休息。房间隔音效果极差，电梯旁边的房间能很清楚的听到人走路、说话以及电梯开关的声音，在房间里还能听到隔壁房间的说话声，并且睡到半夜常有楼上敲地板的声音，持续不断，非常烦人；酒店后面还有工地在施工，常常早晨6－7点就开始干活，吵的人不胜其烦。,"You must not live. The reason is as follows 1. The management is poor and the service quality is extremely poor.I set up the 3 -day room of Baifu Hotel. The next day (not at the checkout time) did not find the key card. What should I do to consult the front desk? I did not provide any suggestions at the front desk. The first sentence is to ask me to compensate the key card 50 50Yuan's cash was at that time; this was not counting. The waiter helped me redefine the key card that morning, but I couldn't open the door. I changed the new key card 3 times up and down.Help me solve the problem as soon as possible. I left because I was in a hurry at that time, but when I came back at 6 o'clock in the evening, the new key card still could not open the door. Later, I negotiated and changed the house.If you don't see it, it has been delayed for nearly an hour to change the house; colleagues with me stayed with me at the same time, and lived for two nights. During this period, no waiter helped to clean up until the third day of the checkout and left the room.Room!2. The sound insulation effect is extremely poor, and the construction site construction disturbates rest.The sound sounding effect of the room is extremely poor. The room next to the elevator can clearly hear people walking, speaking, and the sound of the elevator switch. You can still hear the sound of the room next door in the room, and often sleep in the middle of the night.The sound continues, it is very annoying; there is also the construction site behind the hotel, and often starts to work at 6-7 in the morning, and the noisy people are annoying."
0,房间设施太陈旧，缺少衣橱，卫生间的瓷砖以及毛巾都发黄了，好象是别的酒店淘汰下来的．总的来讲有点对不起２０９元的房价．,"The room facilities are too old, lack of wardrobe, tiles and towels in the bathroom are yellow, as if they were eliminated by other hotels.In general, I am a bit sorry for the house price of 209 yuan."
1,"房间有些旧了.而且我住的房间进去后居然没有打扫出来.前台和服务员协同不好.补充点评2007年12月9日：这家酒店的服务大不如从前,设施也旧了,以后不住了.","The room is a bit old. And after the room I lived in, I didn't clean it out. The front desk and the waiter were not good. Supplementary reviews December 9, 2007: The service of this hotel is not as good as before, and the facilities are old.It's."
0,我们住店被诬陷多消费了房内的物品，我们订了两个房间，我只消费了个王老吉，另外一个房间无消费，然后搞出我的房间消费了四样东西，另外一个房间消费了三样东西。因为我们是中午电话退房的，下午快5点的时候才去结的帐，她们说房间被打扫好了无法查证。靠，难道要我住店先仔细核对房内物品啊！要么是服务员偷东西，要么是宾馆讹诈，同时我们也庆幸贵重东西我们都随身携带，没有造成更大的损失。急着赶飞机，最后只有付钱走人。这将是我最后一次入住这家酒店。我对我的言论负责，我的个人信息携程都有的！,"Our shop was framed and consumed more items in the room. We ordered two rooms. I only consumed Wang Laoji. The other room had no consumption. Then I made four things in my room.Three things.Because we got out of the phone at noon, the accounts that were closed at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, they said that the room was cleaned and could not be verified.Damn, do you want to stay in the store carefully and check the items in the room!Either the waiter stealing Dongxi or the blackmail of the hotel. At the same time, we are also glad that we carry it with our west without causing greater losses.In a hurry to catch the plane, in the end, only pay for it.This will be the last time I stayed in this hotel.I am responsible for my remarks, I have my personal information Ctrip!"

1,性价比较高，我住了一晚之后从乐山回来又续订了两晚，比较满意。,"The cost is relatively high. After one night I lived, I returned from Leshan to renew it for two nights, which was more satisfied."
1,春节期间入住，房价稍高，但还算物有所值。酒店设施完善，房间干净整洁。服务员态度很好，工作热情。地理位置稍为不方便，到中央大街、冰雪大世界、太阳岛等景点打车约为10-20元人民币。从机场前往酒店可坐机场巴士到民航大厦(总站)，再打车约10分钟，10-15元人民币。,"Checking in during the Spring Festival, house prices are slightly higher, but it is worth it.The hotel facilities are perfect, and the rooms are clean and tidy.The waiter has a good attitude and enthusiasm for work.The geographical location is slightly inconvenient. It is about 10-20 yuan to take a taxi at Central Street, Big Ice World, Sun Island and other attractions.From the airport to the hotel, you can take the airport bus to the Civil Aviation Building (Terminal), and then take a taxi for about 10 minutes, 10-15 yuan."
1,1.交通非常方便，海烟酒店走5分钟就是大连路地铁站。非常满意！：）打车去虹桥机场基本60左右就够（当然你也可以地铁＋打的）。去浦东，建议地铁到龙阳路（4元吧），然后打的过去。又便宜，又不堵车。2.周围环境没什么突出的，都是住宅，小便利店有。3.房间还算宽敞，比较整洁，赠送饮料和上网（需要给前台电话开通）。从房间可以看到部分陆家嘴的建筑。以为离外滩很近，步行去外滩结果花了1个多小时，关键好多地方在施工，根本过不去。打车回来，只要15元左右就到了。4.早餐20元，但是自助餐的种类比较少。去的晚了的话，吃的东西不多，补餐不及时。关键还是样式少。中午和晚上正餐的花样不多，价格稍稍贵了些。5.工作人员蛮热情，继续努力！：）总体性价比还是非常高的一家酒店。强烈推荐！补充点评2008年6月26日：最近还要去上海，还准备入住。不知道是不是回头客有优惠啊？！：）,"1. The transportation is very convenient. The Haiyan Hotel is 5 minutes to walk at Dalian Road Metro Station.Very satisfied!:) Drive to Hongqiao Airport is basically about 60 (of course you can also hit the subway +).Go to Pudong, it is recommended to go to Longyang Road (4 yuan), and then play.It is cheap and not traffic jam.2. There is nothing prominent in the surrounding environment. They are all houses and small convenience stores.3. The room is quite spacious and more neat.From the room, you can see some Lujiazui buildings.I thought it was very close to the Bund. It took more than an hour to walk to the Bund. There are many places in many places.When you take a taxi, it will arrive in about 15 yuan.4. Breakfast is 20 yuan, but there are few types of buffets.If you go late, you don't eat much, and the meal is not timely.The key is less style.There are not many tricks at noon and evening, and the price is slightly more expensive.5. The staff is quite enthusiastic and continue to work hard!:) The overall cost performance is still a very high hotel.highly recommended!Supplementary comment on June 26, 2008: I have to go to Shanghai recently and prepare to stay.I don't know if there are discounts on the return guest?Intersection: :)"
1,12月在金泉订了个豪华商务小套房，房间内部环境不错，酒店位于市中心边缘，周边交通还算方便，打车到昆明有名的金马碧鸡刚好起步价。缺点是碰上昆明柴油紧张，没有空调，晚上较冷，还好向酒店要了个空调扇，可以吹热风，否则晚上睡觉一定会感到冷。,"In December, a luxurious business small suite was booked in Jinquan. The internal environment of the room was good. The hotel was located on the edge of the city center. The surrounding transportation was convenient. The famous golden horse blue chicken at Kunming just started the price.The disadvantage is that when you encounter Kunming diesel, you have no air conditioning. It is colder at night. Fortunately, you asked the hotel to ask the hotel to blow the hot air, otherwise you will feel cold when you sleep at night."

1,到三亚休息两天，是我临时做的决定。当时由于勿忙，利用小休的时间入飞来三亚，前两天在三亚湾住。最后一天，入住了环球城酒店，感觉这座酒店的环境非常不错。由于匆忙，连相机都没来得及带。和女友一起，在海滩上休息玩耍时，看到美丽的亚龙湾景色，当时又正愁没有相机合影的苦恼时，发觉有酒店的一名工作人员到海边来拍外景。于是我们请求他帮我们拍了好几张合影。他还主动让我们留下了E-mail。没想到前天我们回到沈阳的时候，打开邮箱一看，照片居然给我发过来了。感觉环球城酒店这样的人性化服务，谢谢！,"Two days to rest in Sanya is the decision I made temporarily.At that time, because of the time not to be busy, used the time to take a break to Sanya, and lived in Sanya Bay two days ago.On the last day, I stayed at the Global City Hotel, and I felt that the hotel's environment was very good.Due to a hurry, he didn't even have time to bring the camera.Together with my girlfriend, when I was resting on the beach, I saw the beautiful Yalong Bay scenery. At that time, when I was worried about the distress of taking a photo with a camera, I found that a staff member of the hotel came to the sea to take a picture.So we asked him to take several photos for us.He also took the initiative to leave E-mail.Unexpectedly, when we returned to Shenyang the day before yesterday, I opened the mailbox and saw it. The photo actually sent me over.I feel humanized services like Universal City Hotel, thank you!"
1,晚上蚊子很多，本人及住在另一间房的朋友都被蚊子咬醒，在房间内找不到驱蚊香。:(,There are a lot of mosquitoes at night. I and my friends living in another room were awakened by mosquitoes.:__
1,"交通方便,市中心,房间比较有意思,不同楼层有不同的装修风格,我住了三次,次次房间都不一样,有米黄的有翠绿的有白色调的.房间上网速度还不错,下次来还住这里,应该说次次来都要住这里,谁让出差对象就在附近呢.推荐~","The transportation is convenient, the city center, the room is more interesting, the different floors have different decoration styles. I live three times. The rooms are different in the second room.I still live here, I should say that I have to live here again and again."
1,订的是商务豪华标准间（带阳台），因为是10/1到的，比较贵，620元，到了后，店家主动给调高乐标准，给的是单床商务套间，2个房间很大，床铺干净舒服，有沙发，还有2个液晶电视，浴室也很大，有个大按摩浴缸，水也很热，上网也很快。总之，黄金周期间，这个配置，性价比还是比较高的。位置比较稍偏点，但是自驾的话，不是问题。门口有条溪水，晚上枕着溪流声入睡，凉爽。总之，虽然整体是2-3星的样子，但是套间的配置还是比较高的。如果平时去，价格没那么高，应该不错。补充点评2007年10月7日：对了，还可以免费打长途。便于定下一个浏览点的酒店。不过，不嫌麻烦的话，以后有人自驾去庐山，可以到那里后，自己开车找宾馆，进行比较，也很方便的，因为各种档次的宾馆很多的。如果不是自驾的话，还是通过ctrip订房吧。,"The business luxury standard room (with a balcony), because it was 10/1, it was more expensive, 620 yuan, after the arrival, the store took the initiative to adjust the standard of high music. It was given a single -bed business room.The bed is clean and comfortable, with sofas, and 2 LCD TVs. The bathroom is also very large. There is a large massage bathtub. The water is also hot and the Internet is fast.In short, during the Golden Week, this configuration is relatively cost -effective.The position is slightly biased, but it is not a problem for self -driving.There was a stream at the door, and the sound of the stream fell asleep at night, which was cool.In short, although the overall is 2-3 stars, the configuration of the suite is relatively high.If you usually go, the price is not so high, it should be good.Supplementary comment on October 7, 2007: By the way, you can also play for free long distances.It is easy to set the next hotel.However, if it is not troublesome, someone will drive to Lushan in the future. After you get there, you can drive to find a hotel by yourself. It is also very convenient because there are many hotels of various grades.If it wasn't for self -driving, book a house through Ctrip."
1,大年初五9个人入住16楼的2房1厅+3房一厅，我住二房的，像新装修的100平米公寓，设备应有尽有，装修有品位，很超值，住四个人很宽裕。因紧靠云南路，外环境一般，远眺可见大海。行李员和客房服务态度好，较专业。本来一切很完美，可是结帐时，大队人马在餐厅午餐，被告知我房间有一非赠品洗漱包被拿走，须付25元，见都没见过，搞什么？还说一套房间有放，另一套没放，那了套样品给我看，滑稽的很，我跟大堂副理说，你们内部有问题，20分钟不搞清楚，我打110来检查行李，后来总算OK。真有点老鼠屎坏一锅汤的味道！,"On the fifth day of the New Year, 9 people stayed in the 2 -bedroom, 1 hall, and 3 rooms on the 16th floor. I lived in the second room. Like the newly renovated 100 -square -meter apartment, the equipment should be available. The decoration has a taste and great value.Because of Yunnan Road, the outside environment is general, and the sea can be seen from a distance.Luggagers and guest rooms have a good attitude and professional.Originally, everything was perfect, but at the checkout, the brigade was lunch in the restaurant, and was told that there was a non -gift toilet bag in the room and had to be taken away. I had to pay 25 yuan. I never saw it. What did I do?I also said that there was a room for a room, and the other set was not placed. The set of samples showed me funny. I told the deputy manager of the lobby that you have a problem inside. Don't figure it out for 20 minutes. I call 110 to check the luggage, Later, finally OK.A little bit of mouse shit, a pot of soup!"
0,我十一来住了两天，一进门就象给骗的感觉。进旅馆有几百米的泥路。是很普通的装饰。价格上没有一点优势。不是黄金周定房不能退我就马上走了。这里没有停车场，停车要到隔壁缴费停车。哪天有个广州车停在路边过夜给老板骂个半死。我们带了几个小孩去玩，有一点调皮。小孩给老板的妈妈骂的很刻薄。天啊！我花五百多一晚来住还要受这样的气。呵呵！真的象他的广告一样：有回家的感觉。“因为我回家总是给老妈叨唠”,"I lived for two days for two days, and when I entered the door, I felt like cheating.There are hundreds of meters in the hotel.It is very ordinary decoration.There is no advantage in the price.It's not that the golden week's fixed house can't leave me and leave immediately.There is no parking lot here.One day, a Guangzhou car parked on the side of the road overnight and scolded the boss half to die.We brought a few children to play, a little naughty.The child scolded the boss's mother very mean.Oh my god!I spent more than five hundred a night to live in this kind of anger.hehe!It's really like his advertisement: it feels like going home.""Because I always give my mother home when I go home"""
0,差、差、差！携程的星级评定有问题，同志们仅供参考。,"Poor, poor, bad!There are problems with Ctrip's star assessment, and comrades are for reference only."
1,地点很好，虽然偏闹了些。虽然没有早餐比较叫遗憾，好在成都是小吃的天堂而且尚能吃辣所以遗憾就少许多了,"The location is very good, although it is partial.Although there is no breakfast, it is more regrettable. Fortunately, Chengdu is a paradise for snacks and can still eat spicy food, so it is much less regrettable."
1,不错的选择。房间整洁卫生、服务也不错，价格合理，交通便利。,"Good choice.The room is clean and hygienic, the service is good, the price is reasonable, and the transportation is convenient."
1,5.1期间在这住的，位置还可以，在市委市政府附近，要去商业区和步行街得打车，屋里有蚊子，虽然空间挺大，晚上熄灯后把窗帘拉上简直是伸手不见五指，很适合睡觉，但是会被该死的蚊子吵醒！打死了两只，第二天早上还是发现又没打死的，卫生间挺大，但是设备很老旧。,"During the 5.1 period, the location is okay. Near the Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government, you have to take a taxi to the business district and pedestrian street. There are mosquitoes in the house. Although the space is quite large, the curtains are pulled up at night.Suitable for sleeping, but it will be awakened by the damn mosquito!I killed two. The next morning I found that I hadn't killed it. The bathroom was quite large, but the equipment was very old."
0,1、房间里过于奢华的家具不实用，且没有家的温馨2、睡到凌晨发现有老鼠在放家里爬，打电话给前台要求换房，前台让我自己下楼换房卡，理由是服务员睡觉了3、调到价位低的房间后，第二天结账还要按照高价位结算，并且对房间发现老鼠一事没有意思的道歉4、over,"1. The too luxurious furniture in the room is not practical, and there is no warmth of the home. 2. Sleeping until early in the morning, I found that a mouse climbed at home and called the front desk to change the house.Sleeping 3. After adjusting to a room with a low price, the next day, the checkout will be settled at a high price, and an apology of the mouse that the mouse is found in the room 4. OVER"
1,这家酒店的餐饮要改进。没有西餐（以前是有的）；二楼中餐厅只开早茶，没有午餐和晚餐（但有晚茶，要晚上8点开始）；一个人吃饭也要坐在包房里，觉得怪怪的。不过早茶很好，人满为患，早上8点过后去就要等位了。,"The restaurant of this hotel should be improved.There is no western food (previously available); the restaurant on the second floor only opens morning tea, no lunch and dinner (but there are night tea, start at 8 o'clock in the evening); a person has to sit in the private room for dinner, it feels weird.However, early tea is very good, and people are overcrowded. After 8 o'clock in the morning, you have to wait."
0,破酒店上网慢的一踏糊涂。网卡只有10M的连接速度。什么年代了。还用这么慢的交换机。会还有早餐难吃的要死。没什么东西吃的。连煎个鸡蛋都等不到。还是他们的领班在煎店。一边煎还一边在吃。水果就更没什么好吃的了。住了几次就没吃到什么水果。。,Breaking the hotel on the Internet slowly.The network card is only a connection speed of 10m.What age.Use such a slow switch.There will be breakfast to die.Nothing to eat.I can't even have a fried egg.Still their leader is in the fried shop.Fry while eating.Fruit is even more delicious.I didn't eat any fruits after I lived several times.Essence
1,"新楼环境还是可以的,不过貌似没什么人,中餐厅的装修还是比较陈旧.服务周到,值得下次再去","The environment of the new building is still okay, but there seems to be no one."
1,酒店的地理位置还不错，靠近步行街，属于闹市区，248的价钱，还有房间里面有电脑可以免费上网，一点要提到的是，酒店的免费自助早餐还不错，总体来说还是可以的。有点遗憾的是房间的环境差了点，一进去的空气就不好，设施整体有点旧，隔音差了点。补充点评2008年5月6日：步行街吃的就少了点，酒店拐往步行街就有家邓氏筒骨，不知道怎么样，步行街的国货广场一楼就是PISSA，和KFC，那晚找不到其他好吃的，最后只能吃KFC，对于比较讲究吃的朋友就要先搜索那边有什么好吃的了,"The hotel's geographical location is not bad. It is close to the pedestrian street. It belongs to the downtown area, the price of 248, and there are computers in the room to access the Internet for free. One thing to mention is that the free buffet breakfast in the hotel is not bad. Generally speaking, it is still possible.It is a bit regrettable that the environment of the room is a bit bad, and the air when it enters is not good. The facilities are a bit old and the sound insulation is worse.Supplementary comment on May 6, 2008: There are less you eat on the pedestrian street. There will be a Deng's tube bone on the pedestrian street when the hotel turns to the pedestrian street.When you go to other delicious, you can only eat KFC in the end. For friends who are more particular about eating, you must first search for any delicious food there."

1,应该是亦庄经济技术开发区最好的酒店了，交通便利，环境安静。只是房间比较小，前台服务态度一般。,"It should be the best hotel in Yizhuang Economic and Technological Development Zone, with convenient transportation and quiet environment.It's just that the room is relatively small, and the front desk service attitude is average."
1,就在机场对面，走到机场就5分钟吧，如果要赶飞机的话住那里还蛮方便的，里面的设施就一般了，3星的标准吧,"Just opposite the airport, just 5 minutes to the airport. If you want to catch the plane, it is quite convenient to live there. The facilities inside are average."
1,"一直到深圳都是住这个酒店,除了交通便利外,酒店也非常的整洁干净,390元的价位在深圳也只能住到这样子的酒店.如果说唯一一点不足的话,就是酒店房间走廊内经常没开空调,天热的时候走进去感觉非常闷热","Until Shenzhen is living in this hotel. In addition to convenient transportation, the hotel is also very neat and clean. The price of 390 yuan can only stay in such a hotel in Shenzhen.I didn't turn on the air conditioner, and it felt very sultry when I walked in when it was hot."
1,7月18日入住的。140元的房价虽然没有早餐、宽带但依然是非常值的。酒店服务员态度非常好。我是自驾车旅游。所以对于酒店稍微偏离市区无所谓的。不过上高速特别方便。总之这个酒店是去黄山旅游人的上佳入住点。不过回来后发现酒店的140元房间突然就无法预定了。不知道是为什么？有点是肯定的，酒店的入住率很低的。我上礼拜去的时候入住率不到60%。难道酒店觉得没钱赚所以取消了？如果是这样的话，那就太不应该了。这样也会影响酒店的信誉的。,"Stayed on July 18.Although the price of 140 yuan has no breakfast and broadband, it is still very worthwhile.The hotel waiter attitude is very good.I travel by car.So it doesn't matter if the hotel is slightly deviated from the urban area.However, it is particularly convenient to go high -speed.In short, this hotel is a good check -in point for tourists to Huangshan.However, after returning, I found that the hotel's 140 yuan room was suddenly unable to book.do not know why?It's certain that the hotel's occupancy rate is very low.When I went last week, the occupancy rate was less than 60%.Does the hotel feel that there is no money to make money so it is canceled?If this is the case, it should not be too.This will also affect the credibility of the hotel."
1,酒店是个环境很好的地方，需要乘船才能到达，感觉就像去了世外桃源一样。但是去酒店不是容易的事情，希望有携程可以把怎样去到那里说一下，让旅游者有充分的准备。,"The hotel is a place with a good environment. It needs to take a boat to reach it. It feels like going to Xanadu.But it is not easy to go to the hotel. I hope that Ctrip can go there and talk about it, so that tourists are fully prepared."
0,"不知道该怎么评价了.这是一个能让11点后入住的所有客人洗冷水澡的酒店.打电话问客房,客房说,我可是告诉了前台没热水的.前台说，我又不清楚这个事,难道你要我来帮你烧水?忍着,洗冷水.但第二天下午办完事回来洗澡，又是冷水...回答是才停气了.我又只得洗冷水.另外，浴房奇小无比,站在里面洗澡手会不停的碰到水管或玻璃房,生痛.蓬头水压奇低,一股小水喷出来.当然这酒店也有闪光点，中层管理人员素质较高,出了问题,他们在积极解决,说话也通情达理.坏就坏在个别的一线服务上.","I don’t know how to evaluate it. This is a hotel that can take a cold bath for all guests who can stay at 11 o'clock. Call the guest room. The room said, but I told the front desk without hot water. The front desk said, I doDo you want me to help you boil water? To bear it, wash cold water. But after finishing the next afternoon, I came back to take a bath, and it was cold water ... The answer was stopped. I had to wash cold water again. In additionThe bathroom is extremely small. Standing in the bathing hand, you will constantly touch the water pipe or glass room. The painful. The flush head water pressure is low, and a small water is sprayed out. Of course, the hotel also has a flash point, the quality of the middle management personnel qualityHigh, something wrong, they are actively solving, and their words are reasonable. Badness is bad on individual front -line services."
1,"住的行政大床房,虽然在义乌这个房价有点高,但我觉得值得推荐,服务都不错的","The administrative big bed room for living is a bit high in Yiwu's house price, but I think it is worth recommending and the service is good."
1,整体的感觉都很不错，可能是因为公司也在楼上的缘故，觉得很方便。酒店位置在珠海也属于很便利的。,"The overall feeling is very good, maybe because the company is also upstairs, it feels very convenient.The hotel location is also very convenient in Zhuhai."
1,设备完善，环境较好。就是楼层服务员不能及时地帮助客人与前台联系上，不过，总体还算好了。,"The equipment is perfect and the environment is better.It is that floor waiters cannot help guests contact the front desk in time, but the overall is pretty good."
1,这次的入住，因为用港澳身份证预订登记的，所以安排的楼层高了很多．呵呵．真是区别大呢．而且房间很新，似乎改造过．行李员态度不错．下午茶款式丰富．入住还送了五十元的代金券，这样算下来房间价格是很划算的．如果下午再来会再考虑入住．,"This time, because the Hong Kong and Macau ID card was booked and registered, the floor was much higher.hehe.It's really different.And the room is new, it seems to have been transformed.The attitude of the luggage is good.Afternoon tea is rich.I also sent 50 yuan vouchers to check in, so the price of the room is very cost -effective.If you come again in the afternoon, you will consider check -in."
1,酒店比较干净，设施也不错。反正就200出头的酒店也是相当的不错了，就是一般房间不带早餐让人不解，钱也不多啊。。。。大不了转嫁到房费里面好了,"The hotel is relatively clean and the facilities are good.Anyway, the hotel in his early 200s is quite good, that is, the general room does not have breakfast with breakfast, which is puzzled and the money is not much.EssenceEssenceEssenceThe big deal is passed on to the room fee"
1,最喜欢房间内的卫生间。大大的浴缸。浴缸内也带花洒。很方便。独立的淋浴房空间也很大。以后还会选择的,Favorite toilets in the room.Large bathtub.There are also shower in the bathtub.very convenient.Independent shower room space is also very large.I will choose in the future
0,打车到酒店后发现，门面特别小而且差，很不起眼。到前台办手续又发现态度特别差，还摆着服务标兵的牌子，我是一点也没感觉到。房间也很一般。第二天中午时，我因为是下午四点半的飞机，因此商量能否将退房时间稍微延迟二十分钟左右，答复是一分都不行，超过一分钟就算半天，口气还很不友好！,"After taking a taxi to the hotel, I found that the facade was particularly small and poor.I found that the attitude was particularly poor at the front desk offices, and I had a sign of the service pace. I didn't feel it at all.The room is also very average.At noon the next day, because I was a plane at 4:30 in the afternoon, so whether I could discuss the check -out time slightly for about 20 minutes. The reply was not possible. For more than a minute, I was very unfriendly!"
1,酒店很不错，性价比很好的。虽然在洛阳繁华的路段，但晚上休息非常安静，睡的很饱。同时去龙门也比较方便，有公交车，乘坐出租车去龙门24元左右就可以到达的。,"The hotel is very good and cost -effective.Although in the prosperous section of Luoyang, the rest at night was very quiet and full of sleep.It is also more convenient to go to Longmen at the same time. There is a bus. You can get it at about 24 yuan to Longmen by taxi."
0,酒店应该加强服务意识，配套很差，该有的服务没有，环境比较旧，应该加以修葺，翻新，配套设施与服务应加强。,"Hotels should strengthen service awareness, poor supporting facilities, no services, the environment is relatively old, should be repaired, renovated, supporting facilities and services should be strengthened."
0,基本上是个硬件很差，服务尚可的酒店。入住第一晚，空调出风口没装好，有金属碰撞的声音，不大，但足以让我一晚上在床上做思想斗争是否起来叫人修一下。总之就是没睡好。卫生间很窄，灯光昏暗，非得开浴霸才能亮堂点。毛巾没一条不掉毛，估计从计划经济的时候就开使了吧，洗了这么多年也够不容易的。还好床上用品都挺干净。家具很陈旧了。服务不错，入住，离店都很快。门童用几乎挑衅的眼光目送我们拿着一堆行礼推门入店，到前台办理入住。没有问候，没有帮忙。呃，还有之前那位老兄提到的，电梯真的很不方便，三部电梯分散联动，中间有个拐角挡住，运气不好得来回跑。决不住这儿了。呃，后面是有条街，也就一家做肥肠的门脸大点，东西不好吃，上桌的菜里有捆菜的塑料绳。,"Basically, it is a hotel with poor hardware and service.On the first night of staying in, the air -conditioning outlet was not installed. There was a sound of metal collision, not big, but it was enough to make me a thought struggle in bed all night to make people repair it.In short, I didn't sleep well.The bathroom is very narrow and the light is dim.There is no hair loss of the towel. It is estimated that it will be made from the planned economy. It is not easy to wash it for so many years.Fortunately, the bedding is very clean.The furniture is very old.The service is good, check -in, and the store is very fast.Men Tong sent us a bunch of gifts to push the door to enter the store with almost provocative eyes and go to the front desk to check in.No greetings, no help.Uh, and the previous man mentioned that the elevator was really inconvenient. The three elevators were scattered and linking, and there was a corner in the middle. The luck had to run back and forth.I can't help here.Uh, there is a street behind, and the door of the fat intestine is bigger, and the things are not delicious. There are plastic rope bundles of vegetables on the table."
0,酒店很干净，房间不错，早餐一般，但是周围环境不好，基本上没有什么可以吃饭的地方。,"The hotel is very clean, the room is good, the breakfast is normal, but the surrounding environment is not good, basically there is nothing to eat."
1,物有所值。酒店气氛非常好。餐厅食品可口。房间整洁，环境豪华。,It is worthwhile.The hotel atmosphere is very good.Food food can be mouth.The room is clean and the environment is luxurious.
0,我是临晨到中山水田店，他服务还算热情，但是前台非常不专业问什么都不知道。而且除了2百多的只有标准间，要单人房的只有6百多的，十分不合理。作为一个四星酒店，连吹风机都没有，打电话问询后答复就是没有的，吹风机是从其他地方借的。当我说要投诉她时没过五分钟就送过来了。服务是能推就推，十分差！,"I went to Zhongshan waterfield shop. He was quite enthusiastic, but the front desk was very unprofessional and I didn't know anything.And in addition to the only standard rooms, only 600 single rooms are required, which is very unreasonable.As a four -star hotel, there is no hair dryer. After calling inquiries, it is not available. The hair dryer is borrowed from other places.I said it would be delivered in five minutes when I was going to complain.The service can be pushed, very bad!"
1,"这家酒店是由常州和平假日酒店按照四星标准管理的酒店,还未",This hotel is a hotel managed by the Changzhou Heping Holiday Hotel according to the four -star standard.
1,地点不错，服务也很好，提供好几种枕头选择，包括晚上有送一杯热饮，非常贴心，以后还会入住。,"The location is good and the service is also very good. It provides several pillow options, including sending a cup of hot drink at night. It is very intimate and will stay in the future."
1,酒店不太好找，如果没有GPS基本上找不到。感觉酒店设备有点旧，但是比较安静，服务员的服务态度尚可，以后可以考虑还住这里。,"The hotel is not easy to find, and there is basically no GPS.I feel that the hotel equipment is a bit old, but it is relatively quiet. The service attitude is acceptable. You can consider living here in the future."
0,酒店环境一般服务却极差动不动所有经理都出来侮辱游客不舍得给钱不房费还把政治搬出来吓人态度太差我去过的酒店都有中午退房前电话询问是否要续房我是凌晨4点才去的什么都不知道一睡到下午一点就吵着要我交钱我说为什么不提醒我他说我们就是这种规定从经理到员工一个德行劝大家千万别去,"The general service of the hotel environment is extremely poor, but all the managers come out to insult tourists and reluctant to give the money and house fees.I did n’t know if I went to sleep at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. I made a noise for me to pay me. Why do n’t you remind me that he said that we are such regulations from manager to employees."
1,不错的饭店，饭菜做得也不错，来潍坊这里值得住住,"Good restaurants, the meals are also good, it is worth living here to come to Weifang"
1,酒店还是非常的不错，我预定的是套间，服务非常好，随叫随到，结帐非常快。顺便提一句，这个酒店三楼是一个高级KTV，里面的服务小姐非常的漂亮，有机会去看看。,"The hotel is still very good. I booked a suite. The service is very good.By the way, the third floor of the hotel is a advanced KTV. The service lady inside is very beautiful and has the opportunity to see it."
1,"房间小,服务不错,交通方便.应该说是自由行挺好的选择","The room is small, the service is good, and the transportation is convenient. It should be said that it is a good choice for free travel"
1,地段好，设施全，服务一流，希望以后还能入住此酒店！宾馆反馈2008年7月8日：首先感谢您此次选择下榻虹桥迎宾馆！您的入住满意就是对我们接待服务工作最好的肯定与激励！酒店员工将一如既往，不断努力，服务好每一位客人，提升服务品质，争取更多的宾客满意率！同时酒店现阶段推出了优惠房价及相应的增值服务，具体您可查询网站内容，真诚期待您的再次光临！,"Good location, complete facilities, first -class service, I hope to stay in this hotel in the future!Hotel feedback on July 8, 2008: First of all, thank you for your choice to stay in Hongqiao Welcome Hotel!Your stay satisfaction is the best affirmation and incentive for our reception service work!Hotel employees will continue to work hard to serve every guest, improve service quality, and strive for more guest satisfaction rates!At the same time, the hotel has launched preferential housing prices and corresponding value -added services. Specifically, you can check the content of the website, and sincerely look forward to your visit again!"
1,酒店地理位置、硬件水平都不错，尤其是卫生间比较舒适。前台服务态度也好，前台接待一律佩共青团徽章上岗，现在可不多见。早餐品种不算太丰富，而且携程的价格太高。我亲眼看见其他一些公司协议价比携程价低至少50元。总体而言值得推荐。,"The hotel's geographical location and hardware level are good, especially the bathroom is more comfortable.The service attitude of the front desk is also good. The front desk reception will always admire the Youth League badge, which is rare now.Breakfast varieties are not too rich, and Ctrip's price is too high.I saw the price ratio of some other companies at least 50 yuan low.Overall it is worth recommending."
1,地理位置越来越显示优越性了，靠近浦东的2个展会地点:东方明珠或者国际会展中心。所以商住客很多。大堂也堂皇，但是房间就显得很小，行政楼层也不例外，另外居然发现淋浴的水也不太大。还有就是楼下停车比较不方便。,"Geographical location is increasingly displayed, two exhibition locations near Pudong: Oriental Pearl or International Convention and Exhibition Center.So there are a lot of merchants.The lobby is also magnificent, but the room looks very small, and the administrative floor is no exception. In addition, the water of the shower is not too large.It is also inconvenient to park downstairs."
0,"我于6月1日再次入住,住的是1312房,首先价格由238元涨到278元,是整个乌鲁木齐酒店旺季都涨了,据说每年7月和8月乌鲁木齐酒店都还要涨,这也可以理解,毕竟就那么几个月可以赚钱,冬天都是零下20几度,人很少.但是我发现房间的迷你吧撤了,只有留了两瓶矿泉水.卫","I stayed again on June 1st, and I lived in Room 1312. First of all, the price rose from 238 yuan to 278 yuan. It was the peak season of the entire Urumqi hotel. It is said that the hotels in Urumqi will rise in July and August each year.It can be understood that after all, it can make money in a few months, and it is minus 20 degrees in winter, and there are few people. But I found that the mini bar in the room was withdrawn, only two bottles of mineral water."
0,酒店位置还可以，离江边很近。房间因为没窗，所以很热，很闷。早餐不是自助，是份饭，不好吃。,"The hotel location is okay, which is very close to the river.Because the room has no windows, it is very hot and stuffy.Breakfast is not a buffet, it is a meal, it is not delicious."
1,"热水系统及浴室排水系统比较糟糕,水冷热很难调节,不是太冷就是过烫,洗完澡浴室就是一地的水.其他还可以,地理位置很不错,相对房价比较吸引人","The hot water system and the bathroom drainage system are relatively bad. It is difficult to adjust the cooling and cold water. It is either too cold or overwhelmed. After the bathing room is water, it is water. Others are okay. The geographical location is very good. Relatively house prices are more attractive."
1,酒店总体感觉还不错，不过有个比较好的是，他们那边有个大型室内游泳馆，据工作人员介绍，目前是扬州目前最好的游泳馆，里面有假山、人工造浪、还有刺激的滑到，建议你过去入住酒店时试试，另外，我们住的房间也不错，据说是新装修的，房间大小基本和套房的差不多，设备也很先进.,"The overall feeling of the hotel feels good, but there is a better thing that there is a large indoor swimming pool in them. According to the staff, it is currently the best swimming pool in Yangzhou with rockery, artificial waves, and stimulus.Sliding, I suggest you try it in the hotel in the past. In addition, the room we live in is also good. It is said to be newly renovated. The size of the room is basically similar to the suite, and the equipment is very advanced."
1,"酒店的地理位置确实不错,购物方便，老外住的多","The geographical location of the hotel is really good, convenient shopping, and more foreigners live"
1,"之前也住过几次,但是因为最近又进行了新的装修,所以进行一次最新的评价,评价日期:2008.02.23优点:1配有电脑,我住了一次商务双人间一次单人键都配有电脑,虽然配置都差不多,但两者还是有差别的:商务双人间电脑:永久电源,不让登QQ,MSN等商务单人间电脑:拔掉钥匙则自动关机,可以上QQ,MSN等2有个人私人柜用来保管个人贵重物品3每天还会送瓶纯净水(可口可乐水森活550ML)给你4交通便利,旁边有洋货市场,天津麻花卖缺点:1早饭中餐不好吃,建议吃西餐(和前台换早餐券即可)2电脑有盗号密码(这可能也是商务双人间电脑不让登QQ,MSN等的原因),而且盗号能力很强5分钟就会盗走,幸好我有密保,所以强烈建议用QQ时一定要用软键盘输入密码3房间偏小4从外面看房间较旧","I also lived several times before, but because of the new decoration recently, a latest evaluation, evaluation date: 2008.02.23 Advantages: 1 equipped with a computer, I lived in a business double room once, one player keys are all equipped with all the one -player keys, all of which are all equipped with a single -person key.There are computers, although the configuration is similar, but there are still differences between the two: Business dual -time computer: permanent power supply, do not allow you to log in to QQ, MSN and other business single -earth computers: unplug the key and automatically shut down. You can go to QQ, MSN, etc.Some personal private cabinets are used to keep personal valuables 3 every day will also send bottle pure water (Coca -Cola Shuisen 550ml) for you 4 traffic convenience, there is a foreign cargo market next to you, Tianjin Twist sells disadvantages(You can change the breakfast coupon with the front desk) 2 The computer has a code stolen password (this may also be the reason why the business double computer does not allow QQ, MSN, etc.), and the number of theft has a strong ability to stole it after 5 minutes. Fortunately, I have a secret insurance guarantee.Therefore, it is recommended to use a soft keyboard to enter the password when using QQ. The room is small. 4 is older from the outside."
0,该酒店确实性价比不是很高，距离该酒店500米左右的衡阳华天应该会比这家好很多，我也问过价格了，华天208（前台价）/康年198（携程价）,"The hotel is indeed not very cost -effective. Hengyang Huatian, which is about 500 meters from the hotel, should be much better than this one. I also asked the price. Huatian 208 (front desk price)/Kang Nian 198 (Ctrip Price)"
1,总体评价算2星就不错了，性价比低，是我有史以来住宿最差的了，比东南亚的一些小国酒店还差，不过没办法，遂宁只有2家4星的，另一家明星康年（据说好些，且价格低）当时无客房，只有住宿天友了。1.床太小了，尤其情侣住宿，不舒服，晚上转个姿势，差点落下去2.室内洗漱用品太小气了，只有2包沐浴露，2包飘柔（便利店出售的那种小包）3.上网收费很不符合星级酒店惯例4.室内装饰几乎没有，连一般酒店介绍本地风土人情的宣传资料都没有5.早餐种类很少，而且供应的很少，一会什么东西都没的吃了，我们只吃了一次，其他时间自己出去吃了,"The overall evaluation is good, and the price is low. It is the worst accommodation in my history. It is worse than some small hotels in Southeast Asia, but there is no way. Suining has only 2 4 stars. Another star Kang Nian (saidOkay, and the price is low.) At that time, there were no rooms, only the stayed in the family.1. The bed is too small, especially the couple's accommodation, uncomfortable, turn a posture at night, almost fell down 2. indoor toiletries are too stingy, only 2 packs of shower gel, 2 packs of fluttering (the small bag sold by convenience stores)3. The online charging is not in line with the practice of star -rated hotels 4. There is almost no indoor decoration. Even the propaganda materials for local customs to introduce local customs.After eating, we only ate once, and I went out for ourselves to eat at other times"
1,位置、价格都比较合理，唯一缺点：宾馆较旧，房间有些异味宾馆反馈2008年2月2日：谢谢您的点评，非常感谢您的宝贵意见，由于酒店已开张营业十年，所以有些设施设备比较陈旧，在此深表歉意，今年，我们将对酒店进行全面的装修，相信不久的将来，一定能满足您的要求，希望您能再次光临。,"The location and price are relatively reasonable. The only disadvantages: the hotel is older, and some odors in the room will feedback February 2, 2008: Thank you for your comments, thank you very much for your valuable opinions. Because the hotel has opened for ten years, some facilities and equipment have been opened for ten years.It is relatively old. I apologize here. This year, we will make a comprehensive decoration of the hotel. I believe that in the near future, we will definitely meet your requirements. I hope you can come again."
1,"早餐很好,条件也不错,就是隔音效果差了些宾馆反馈2008年6月3日：尊敬的宾客：您好！感谢您选择入住我店！对于您反映的房间隔音问题，我店现已计划对客房区域进行改造，届时多数客房的隔音问题将得到较大的改善。","Breakfast is good and the conditions are good, that is, the sound insulation effect is poor. Some hotels feedback on June 3, 2008: Dear guest: Hello!Thank you for choosing to stay in my shop!Regarding the sound insulation problem you reflected, our store has planned to transform the room area, and the sound insulation problems of most rooms will be greatly improved at that time."
1,"看了网上的点评后入住的,服务的确没的说,在其它酒店从未遇到这么贴心的服务。任何一个工作人员都彬彬有理.房间服务响应很快.有小礼物送,有水果送.很不错.有一个小问题:办入住手续时送咖啡,但其实并不是每人都喝的.象我的就浪费了,最好能问一下客人.","After watching the review on the Internet, the service did not say that the service did not encounter such intimate services in other hotels.Any staff member is rational. The room service response is fast. There are small gifts to send, fruit delivery. Very good. There is a small question: send coffee when you check in, but not everyone drinks it.Mine is a waste, it is best to ask the guests."
0,"之前已住过该酒店觉得还可以,但这次感觉却非常糟糕,安排入住的竟然是一间没窗的房间,由于当时比较晚又是唯一的一间房,不得不住,但到现在想起都心有余悸,如那天碰巧有火灾那我怎么办?其实一直有个疑问,为什么通过携程订的房间不是在边上就是在哪一个角?现在还有没窗的!价格问题?宾馆反馈2008年4月22日：首先非常感谢您对酒店的评价，对于您在酒店所感觉的不适，我们深表歉意！携程一直是酒店的重要合作伙伴，对携程的客户我们一直尽量提供最优质的服务，但因酒店建筑格局原因，有三间房间为无窗格局，客人当天预订时较晚，酒店房间较紧张，只有无窗的房间安排。但前台在安排客人入住此类型房间前，均会与客人做好沟通。对于客人所提出的安全问题，此房间除无窗外其它设施设备都一样，且酒店消防系统齐全，每年都有通过消防部门的有关审核，确保客户的生命安全。再次感谢阁下的意见，期待您的再次光临！","I have been in the hotel before, but this time I feel very bad. It turned out to be a room without a window. Because it was later, it was the only room.I have a lingering heart. If I happen to have a fire that day, what should I do? In fact, I have always had a question, why is the room ordered the room ordered by Ctrip?March 22: First of all, thank you for your evaluation of the hotel. We apologize for your discomfort in the hotel!Ctrip has always been an important partner of the hotel. We have always provided the highest quality service for Ctrip customers. However, due to the hotel's construction structure, there are three rooms as a windowless pattern. The guests are relatively late on the day.Window -free room arrangements.However, the front desk will communicate with the guests before arranging guests in this type of room.Regarding the safety issues raised by the guests, this room is the same in addition to other facilities and equipment outside the window, and the hotel fire system is complete. Every year, the relevant review of the fire department has been passed to ensure the safety of the customer's life.Thank you again for your opinions and look forward to your visit again!"
0,"太一般了，比他原来办的如家要略差些！另外，一楼手机是没有信号的，不知道其它楼层怎么样？对不熟悉成都的人来说对会，不过后来得知成都有许多产权式公寓酒店，才138,比它强多了！","It's too ordinary, slightly worse than his home!In addition, there is no signal on the first floor mobile phone. I don't know what other floors are?For those who are unfamiliar with Chengdu, they will meet, but later learned that there are many property -type apartment hotels in Chengdu, which is only 138, which is much stronger than it!"
1,这次是朋友介绍入住的，听说房间很大、很宽敞，入住以后的确如此。前台安排了2002房间，进去就感觉象到了家里一样，房间里有3个床，装修的虽然简单但很温馨，很适合家庭、会务、聚会的人士入住。房间里有冰箱，正好买了冷饮可以解暑。客厅的落地窗大概为了安全起见，虽然不能打开，但也能看的到黄浦江的美景，总之在这么好的地段可以租到那么便宜的酒店公寓，真是物超所值！赞一个宾馆反馈2008年8月5日：非常感谢您的评价。为客户营造一个温馨、舒适、安全的居住环境是我们服务的目的。欢迎再次光临！,"This time, my friend introduced the check -in. I heard that the room was very large and spacious. It was indeed the case after staying.The front desk was arranged in 2002 rooms, and it felt like getting to the house. There were 3 beds in the room. Although the decoration was simple but very warm, it was suitable for people who were family, conferences, and gatherings.There is a refrigerator in the room, and when you buy a cold drink, you can relieve the heat.The floor -to -ceiling windows in the living room are probably for safety. Although they cannot be opened, they can also see the beautiful scenery of Huangpu River. In short, you can rent such a cheap hotel apartment in such a good area. It is really worth it!Praise a hotel feedback on August 5, 2008: Thank you very much for your evaluation.Create a warm, comfortable and safe living environment for customers is the purpose of our service.Welcome to come again!"
1,在该区是最好的酒店，但离市区的酒店有一些差距。,"It is the best hotel in the district, but there are some gaps from hotels in the city."
1,元旦前住的，川妹子服意识很强，很细心。问一答二三，想得比客人超前。房间有些陈旧，但洗澡和空都OK.泉泡上有些憾，泡上的朋友说不错。我去捏脚了，技很好，喜。,"Living before New Year's Day, Sichuan Girl's consciousness was very conscious and very careful.Ask a answer, two or three, and think more than guests.The room is a bit old, but the bath and the empty are ok. Spring is a little regretful, and the friends who bubble say it is good.I went to pinch my feet, my skills are very good and happy."
1,环境很美，服务很好。但房间装修一般，入住时感觉房间很潮，酒店内吃饭的地方太少。,"The environment is beautiful and the service is very good.However, the room decoration is average. When you stay in, you feel that the room is very trendy, and there are too few places to eat in the hotel."
1,酒店非常好特别上服务但可能位置比较好比如去时代广场SOGO百货买东西都非常得方便隔音效果不太好个人觉得因为当初定的是普通的房间后来因为没有房间再没有加钱得前提下房间升级了总得来说酒店免费得巴士以及服务真得很好推荐入住价格公道,"The hotel is very good and special, but it may be better. For example, it ’s very convenient to buy things in the SOGO department store in Times Square. I do n’t feel good. I feel that the room was determined because the original room was later.For upgrading, the hotel is free to get the buses and services for free."
0,很不好我订金刷卡房费付现金刷卡的也一样跟我收我打电话去尽然要我到厦门拿现金实在是无理,"Very bad, my deposit swiping card house fee pays cash swipes, and I collect me with me to call me all the way to get cash in Xiamen. It is unreasonable."
1,"我是7月22日入住酒店的,酒店位于市中心,交通非常方便.酒店规模很大，较多会议接待及商务客人，是真正的商务型酒店；房间相当舒适、干净，而且让人感觉很安全；酒店软件很不错，服务员非常热情周到；自助早餐很丰富，除了可口的点心外还有一些当地特产的木耳和黑笋......酒店宽带及长途电话是免费的，对于我们这种商务客人来说非常方便，入住当天还有水果赠送，大都是当地产的，味道很鲜美。销售部的工作人员服务也非常好，我们是次日凌晨六点退的房，他们特意提前为我们打包好了早餐，我们真的挺感动的，总之，真的是物超所值，下次来还会选择这里！","I stayed at the hotel on July 22. The hotel is located in the city center. The transportation is very convenient. The hotel is very large, and more conference reception and business guests are real business hotels.Safe; hotel software is very good, the waiter is very enthusiastic and thoughtful; the buffet breakfast is very rich. In addition to the delicious snacks, there are some local specialty fungus and black bamboo shoots ... The hotel broadband and long -distance telephone are free. For usIt is very convenient for business guests. On the day of staying, there are also fruits. Most of them are real estate, and the taste is very delicious.The staff of the sales department is also very good. We retired at 6 am the next day. They deliberately packed our breakfast for us in advance. We are really moved. In short, it is really worth it. Next timeCome here!"
0,相当差，真不知道该酒店是怎么升上五星的。升星之后价格还长了，服务却越来越差。建议国家旅游局对其重新评估，否则就是拿了什么好处。柳州若有其他新建4，5星宾馆，估计没有几个人会住这里了,"It's quite poor, I really don't know how the hotel is rising to five stars.After the stars are ascending, the price is still long, but the service is getting worse and worse.It is recommended that the National Tourism Administration re -evaluate it, otherwise what benefits are it.If there are other new 4,5 stars hotels in Liuzhou, it is estimated that few people will live here."
1,总体感觉很不错，酒店的地理位置很好，出行很方便，而且对面就是市政府，景观效果很好，房间面积也很大床很舒服，整个房间给人的感觉很干净、舒适，最值得一提的是酒店的服务，每个服务人员都让人觉得很亲切，因为我带个小孩子，吃早餐时服务人员对我们的照顾更是无微不至，真的很感动，下次来威海我还会选择该酒店，不错不错补充点评2007年9月9日：还得补充一点，退房时相机落房间了，服务员能及时送还，值得表扬,"Overall feels very good, the hotel's geographical location is very good, it is very convenient to travel, and it is the city government. The landscape effect is very good. The room area is very comfortable.The service of the hotel is mentioned. Each service staff makes people feel very kind, because I take a child, and the service staff takes care of us during breakfast. It is really moved. Next time I come to Weihai next time, I will still be in WeihaiChoose the hotel, good and good supplement comments on September 9, 2007: You have to add a little bit, the camera fell in the room when checking out, the waiter can send it back in time, it is worth praising"
1,"酒店位置离市中心很近,很方便.酒店硬件设施也不错,.","The hotel location is very close to the city center, very convenient. The hotel's hardware facilities are also good."
1,"一楼大厅空荡荡的,感觉好象缺点什么.房间还算可以,比较大,不过网线插口离床和办公桌太远了,不方便上网.早餐不行,这哪里是五星级的标准,品种太少了!服务还算OK了,那个男前台还能说几句简单的英语,不过速度较慢.","The lobby on the first floor is empty, and it feels like there are some disadvantages. The room is okay, which is relatively large, but the network cable socket is too far away from the bed and the desk.There is less! The service is OK. The male front desk can also speak a few simple English, but the speed is slow."
1,酒店虽然有点旧，房间也不大，但贵在干净，地点好，在市中心的中山广场边上，上哪都很方便。早餐比较丰富，令人满意。房间洗澡水很大，好像水力按摩一般，很舒服。房间里最让我满意的是有小型桶装水，非常方便，不像很多酒店那样，非得自己烧来喝。酒店给我印象最深的是大门外的一位有络腮胡子的小伙子，对客人非常热情，问他什么都能得到细致、满意的答复。两点不足：1、我订了两晚房间，可第二天中午回来，钥匙竟然打不开门，费了很大工夫又打电话问又下楼到前台办手续，才能进入房间。这种工作失误是不应该的。2、洗手间的马桶很怪，前端非常浅，我坐着大便，小便处垂下来竟然碰到了马桶前端的底部，吓得我赶紧冲洗下部！后来我大便只敢蹲着。,"Although the hotel is a bit old, the room is not large, but the expensive is clean and the location is good. It is convenient to get on the side of Zhongshan Square in the city center.Breakfast is rich and satisfactory.The bathing water in the room is very large, as if hydraulic massage, very comfortable.What is most satisfied with the room in the room is that there are small barrel water, which is very convenient. Unlike many hotels, I have to burn it myself.The most impressed by the hotel was a man with a beard outside the door, which was very enthusiastic about the guests and asked him to get a detailed and satisfactory answer.Two short points: 1. I booked the room for two nights, but I came back at noon the next day. The key couldn't open the door. It took a lot of time to call and asked to go to the front desk for procedures to enter the room.This kind of work error should not be.2. The toilet in the toilet is very strange. The front end is very shallow. I sit on the stool and hang down the bottom of the toilet at the bottom of the toilet. I was scared to rinse the lower part!Later, I dared to squat."
1,"酒店的地理位置优越,适合办公人事入住,服务也比较到位,下次会继续考虑","The hotel's geographical location is superior, suitable for office personnel to stay, and the service is in place. I will continue to consider next time"
0,服务人员的服务态度很不好，不按照酒店规定收取房费，并且乱收费，,"The service staff’s service attitude is very poor. Do not charge the housing fee in accordance with the hotel regulations, and charges charges."
0,地理位置不好，快到民族路顶头了，太偏，出来周围没有什么吃饭和逛的地方。酒店房间小，床太小了。早餐简直太差了，除了凉菜和咸菜，基本没有热菜。而且，8点半刚到，就要撤餐。,"The geographical location is not good, and it is almost the top of the ethnic road. It is too biased. There is no place to eat or stroll around.The hotel room is small and the bed is too small.Breakfast is simply too bad. Except for cold dishes and pickles, there are basically no hot dishes.Moreover, as soon as it arrived at 8:30, the meal was to be withdrawn."
1,时隔一周再次入住，这次定的是商务大床房，好像原先的豪华大床房订不到，商务房里多了传真机，浴室里多了浴缸并且墙上开了一面大窗，房间却看来小了，价格高了100元还可以接受，不过我还是觉得豪华间实用且房间地方宽敞些。这次入住房间里有水果送，不知是不是商务间的缘故。酒店住得还是很舒服，细节之处仍需改进，比如浴室和房间之间墙上的大窗，玻璃很漂亮，但可否考虑加装百叶窗帘，不然房间里有访客就不方便用洗手间了。这次餐厅到了晚上8点没有熄灯，好像还在继续营业，不知是不是上次提的意见起了作用，如是应该赞一个。酒店原来有地下停车场，这次我的车停在地下，虽然上下楼复杂些，不过停车有了宽敞的地方，管车库的老伯挺负责，感觉不错。,"Check in again after a week. This time it is a large business bed room. It seems that the original luxury large bed room cannot be ordered. There are more fax machines in the business room. There are more bathtubs in the bathroom and a large window.But it seems small, the price is 100 yuan, but I still think it is more practical and spacious in the room.There were fruits in the room this time, I wonder if it was because of business rooms.The hotel is still very comfortable, and the details still need to be improved. For example, the large windows on the wall between the bathroom and the room are beautiful, but if you can consider adding a louver curtain, otherwise there will be a toilet in the room.This time the restaurant did not turn off at 8 pm. It seemed to continue business. I wonder if the opinion of the last time was used, and it should be praised.The hotel originally had an underground parking lot. This time my car was parked underground. Although it was more complicated to go upstairs, there was a spacious place in the parking. The old man in charge of the garage was very responsible and felt good."
0,我觉得这个酒店应该是我住过的能评上四星级酒店最烂最烂最烂的一间了。首先，房间还没进门，过道里地毯发霉的味道就绝对让你发晕（我住在7层，那层居然还有经理室之类，他们鼻子坏了吗？）其次，进门以后，被天花板发霉掉落的墙皮灰震惊了，这也是个酒店，应该是个招待所还差不多吧。卫生间还不错，很先进的独立玻璃淋浴房，但是我人不能睡在淋浴房里。再次，超级超级差的隔音，隔壁人很普通的讲电话声音，让我感觉，没有墙的存在。每天早晨对面的经理室、值班室、服务生都会用很大的力气关门，继而热烈的交谈，而这种每天在早晨7点半被震响的经历，实在让我头痛……最后，结账后，我有些东西得拿袋子装，礼貌的问前台mm，能给我个手提袋吗？mm刚给我结完帐，说，你都结账了！我……晕……，忍住，问，那我怎么办，我东西拿不了，我得去机场……mm“你自己去房间拿”我“厄……可是我刚把房卡给您了”……最后我随便去了个楼层，找了楼层服务员要了一个手提袋……我无话可说了这酒店……我明天又要去哈尔滨，但是我打死也不会选择波斯特的宾馆反馈2007年7月27日：对于您在入住酒店期间发生的不如意，我们深表歉意。酒店会加强雨季时楼层的通风以保持清爽干燥，同时在礼宾部预留足够的备用手袋。另外酒店也会加强巡视，最大限度地保证楼层的安静环境。最后我们真诚地欢迎您再次入住，感受我们的改进。,"I think this hotel should be the worst and worst one for the four -star hotel I have been on.First of all, before entering the door, the smell of moldy carpet in the aisle will definitely make you dizzy (I live on the 7th floor, there are still manager rooms or the like, do they have broken noses?) Second, after entering the doorThe moldy wall skin was shocked. This is also a hotel. It should be a guest house.The bathroom is not bad. It is very advanced independent glass shower room, but I can't sleep in the shower room.Third, the super -poor sound insulation, the people next door are very ordinary, making me feel that there is no wall.Every morning, the manager room, duty room, and waiters will close the door with a lot of strength, and then talk warmly. This experience of being shocked at 7:30 in the morning really causes me a headache ... Finally, after the checkoutI have some things to hold bags and ask the front desk MM politely. Can you give me a handbag?MM has just finished my account and said, you're checking out!I ... dizzy ..., hold back, ask, what do I do, I can't get it, I have to go to the airport ... mm ""you go to the room to get"" me ""Oh ... but I just gave you the room card""... Finally, I went to a floor and found a handbag on the floor.Hotel feedback on July 27, 2007: We apologize for your unhappiness that happened during the hotel.The hotel will strengthen the ventilation of the floor during the rainy season to keep it refreshing and dry, and at the same time reserve enough spare handbags in the ritual department.In addition, hotels will strengthen inspections to maximize the quiet environment of the floor.Finally, we sincerely welcome you to stay again and feel our improvement."
0,选了个套间，面积不小。除了电视，装修乏善可陈。窗外望过去竟然是水泥屋顶。不接受信用卡。打长途事先说要0.7元/分钟，这就够可以的了，结帐的时候还要加另外服务费！投诉到经理，居然告诉我系统就是这么设定的，不能改。直到我说要投诉到消协，才重新改过。,"I chose a sleeve, and the area is not small.Except for TV, the decoration is lacking.Looking out of the window was the cement roof.Do not accept credit cards.It is enough to say that it takes 0.7 yuan/minute to fight in the long distance.To the manager, I actually told me that the system was set up, and I couldn't change it.It wasn't until I said that the complaint was to the Consumer Association that I changed it again."
1,居然涨价了。住了几次了，每次感觉各不相同。能给酒店提个意见吗？毛巾太硬太旧了。别光记着涨价，水平能一起涨点吗？整体服务还是不错的。,"Actually increased the price.I have lived a few times, and each time I feel different.Can you give a opinion on the hotel?The towel is too hard and old.Don't keep your price increase, can the level be increased together?The overall service is good."

1,地理位置距离通常的客运码头比较远，要横穿小岛，预计30-40分钟，酒店处于岛的另一面很安静，游客不多，适合疗养，门前就有一个小码头，但每小时一般。,The geographical location is far from the usual passenger terminal. It is necessary to cross the island. It is expected to be 30-40 minutes. The hotel is on the other side of the island. There are not many tourists. It is suitable for recuperation. There is a small pier in front of the door.Essence
1,虽然酒店的设施慢慢有点旧了，但酒店前台的服务人员给人感觉很舒服，门口的服务生也很有服务意识，看我打车似乎不太顺利，就帮我叫车，因为我和的士司机都不太清楚目的地所在，又帮我问其他人我要去的目的地所在。总之感觉比原来的马可孛罗酒店好。,"Although the hotel's facilities are slowly old, the service staff at the front desk of the hotel feels very comfortable, and the waiter at the door is also very service -conscious. Seeing that I do n’t seem to be smooth, I help me call the car because I harmony with me.The drivers do not know where the destination is, and help me ask other people where I am going to the destination.In short, it feels better than the original Marco Lugo Hotel."
1,"环境设施相当的不错,尤其是门口的警卫很给人安全，不愧是吉林省的国宾馆的。我住的是主楼，但是对于对应的价格来说是比较偏高的，个人认为主楼和七栋差别不大，实际来说在南方也都就是3星级的标准，服务员很热情，但是硬件上只能让我综合给3分的。","The environmental facilities are quite good, especially the guards at the door are very safe, and it is indeed a national hotel in Jilin Province.I live in the main building, but it is relatively high for the corresponding price. I personally think that the main building and the seven buildings are not much different. In fact, they are all 3 -star standards in the south.I can only give me 3 points."
1,此次去三亚，共住了3家宾馆，第一家是三亚湾的普通的，感觉还算干净，只是没热水，而且进房间的时候发现了一只壁虎，吓的不轻。第二天住提天域，虽然感觉没有喜来登的好，但是确是此次三亚旅游入住的三家中条件最好的，只是早餐太贵了，又没东西吃.珠江在大东海，所以俄罗斯人特别多，而且当地人去海滩的也多，感觉好像太嘈杂了。我们后来改为海景房，看海景还不错，阳台太小了，简直是可怜，房间还可以，吃的也是恶贵，午餐一个蔬菜、一个点心、一个菜泡饭，结帐要100多，晕倒。还有要提醒的是如果到春园那边吃海鲜，需要有耐心，我们三个人，点了4-5个菜，结果等了2小时，才把所有的菜上完。（还是老板娘亲自出马催，才在2小时之内吃好）,"When I went to Sanya this time, I stayed in three hotels. The first one was the ordinary of Sanya Bay. It felt clean, but there was no hot water. When I entered the room, I found a gecko, which was not scared.The next day I lived in Titian Realm. Although I felt that I was not good, but it was indeed the best conditions for the three families to stay in Sanya this time, but the breakfast was too expensive, and there was nothing to eat. The Pearl River was in the Great East China Sea, so the RussiansThere are so many, and there are many locals who go to the beach, it feels too noisy.We later changed to the sea view room. It was not bad to see the sea view. The balcony was too small. It was just pitiful. The room was okay.EssenceAlso reminded that if you eat seafood at the Spring Garden, we need to be patient.

0,酒店已经很老旧，却刚刚评上四星，就这样的酒店，不如浙江的二星水平，房间卫生间异味很重，浴巾毛巾都有水毛臭，也许是鄙视携程的客户，给的又是一间最靠楼梯的房间，我没有提出换房，觉得下次不会再住这家了，连客房的沙发凳档次都低很多，枉我以前来鞍山都订这里，便宜真正没好货，楼梯道充满澡堂子的味道，商务中心都没有，发个传真还得去销售部，房间里却布满了按摩的纸张广告，有些滑稽。电视机的节目也没有四星标准，凤凰卫视的信号断断续续，还只有图象，其它几个卫星频道也是信号奇差，基本是夹杂着大雪花，没法看；早餐也是典型的东北杂烩，与一众泳客们对坐，实在差劲。我看，一无是处吧，除了便宜，但这样的便宜，不要也罢，我要退房。还想说，评星级的评委一定都各需要一只导盲犬。黑，忒黑。强烈要求携程在鞍山多搜集几家星级酒店，以便有选择余地。,"The hotel is already very old, but just commented on the four stars. This kind of hotel is not as good as Zhejiang's two -star level. The room toilet is very heavy. Bath towels and towels have water and hair odor. Maybe they despise Ctrip's customers.The room in the most staircase, I did not propose to change the house, and I felt that I won't live in this house next time. Even the sofa and stools in the rooms are much lower.Dao is full of the taste of the bathhouse, and there is no business center. You have to go to the sales department to send a fax, but the room is covered with massage paper advertisements, which is a bit funny.There are no four -star standards for TV programs. Phoenix Satellite TV's signals are intermittent, and only images are only images. The other satellite channels are also poor signals. Basically, they are mixed with heavy snowflakes.The swimmers were sitting against each other.I see, it ’s useless, except for cheap, but such cheap, do n’t, I want to check out.I also want to say that star judges must have a guide dog.Black, dark.It is strongly required to collect several star hotels in Anshan in Anshan to have room for choice."
1,去瑞安一直住“国际”，因为“国际”不管是硬件还是软件都是当地最好的酒店。无烟楼层特别安静，大床房很舒服，晚上睡得很好，就是下午楼上在装修有点炒。不过总体上和第一次入住时的感受已有差距，设施设备有点旧了，晚上没做夜床，旅游团人多拥挤，希望酒店管理层能考虑做适当小改造，以吸引更多更忠诚的客源。,"Going to Ruian has always lived in ""International"", because ""international"" is the best local hotel whether it is hardware or software.The smoke -free floor is particularly quiet, the big bed room is very comfortable, and sleeps well at night, that is, the decoration in the afternoon is a bit fried.However, there is a gap in the feeling when I first stay in and for the first time. The facilities and equipment are a bit old. I did not do the night bed at night. The tour groups were crowded. I hope that the hotel management can consider making appropriate small transformations to attract more loyalty and more loyalty.The source of the customer."
1,本以为458的价格，房间不会太小，可进去以后，还是小得让人吃惊，说实话都没有北京锦江之星之类的连锁200多元的地方大！酒店的优点也许就在离南京路和外滩很近，城隍庙走着过去也不是很远。,"I thought the price of 458 would not be too small, but after entering, it was still surprisingly small. To be honest, there was no more than 200 yuan in the chain of Jinjiang Star in Beijing!The advantages of the hotel may be very close to Nanjing Road and Bund, and the Chenghuang Temple is not far away."
1,7月份住了2天。是我住过最好的4星级宾馆之一。交通非常方便，离榆次老城非常近，走路5分钟可到达。房间里面还提供杂志和旅游指南。地毯很厚，而且非常干净。住的很开心。下次绝对还会选择这家酒店。物有所值。,I lived in July for 2 days.It is one of the best 4 -star hotels I have.The transportation is very convenient.

1,房间比较大，相对来说房间的设施和空间很好，在一些小的细节方面有些注意就更好了．早饭的质量一般，服务员在服务上有点拖拉，大堂的感觉也不是很温馨，硬件上到了．位置上还好周围比较方便．从星级上来说价格上和一些相同地区的比较起来略高．总体感觉：４星的设施，３星半的服务人员，３星的早餐．总体打分：３星半吧．,"The room is relatively large. Relatively speaking, the room's facilities and space are very good, and it is better to pay attention to some small details.The quality of breakfast is average, the waiter is a little dragged on the service, and the lobby feels not very warm.

1,从市内打车要15元，偏远了一点，不过到了以后才发现环境不错，比较满意,"It costs 15 yuan from the city to take a taxi, which is a bit remote, but after it, I found that the environment is good and more satisfied"
1,上帝啊，价格怎么半年就涨了100元？我得回到光大住了。。。不过，作为一个公寓式酒店，蛮值得推荐的。就是早餐不甚好。,"God, why did the price rose 100 yuan in half a year?I have to return to Everbright.EssenceEssenceHowever, as an apartment -style hotel, it is quite recommended.It's not good for breakfast."

1,和网友们说的差不多，酒店环境还算不错，位置比较安静，房价也挺新。楼层共用空间的阅览区挺有特色，也挺温馨。酒店酒吧可以玩免费玩具和美式台球。但400多携程价格在无锡没什么竞争力，毕竟他不是市中心酒店，而且无锡酒店现在生意都不太好。宾馆反馈2008年8月12日：感谢您对我们酒店支持与厚爱，酒店全体员工期待您的下次光临！！,"It's almost the same as netizens. The hotel environment is pretty good, the location is relatively quiet, and house prices are quite new.The reading area of the shared space of the floor is very distinctive and warm.You can play free toys and American tables.However, the price of more than 400 Ctrip is not competitive in Wuxi.

0,很不怎么样的酒店，根本不象三星级。1、大堂：受理很慢，且服务员连你好都不会说；2、房间：我订的是大床房间，电视机很旧，卫生间里洗澡的地方是用玻璃隔起来的，空间很狭小，而且热水放出来的里面全是棕红色的铁锈，洗澡时水温忽冷忽热；比较变态的是，房间里没有预备网线，你得打电话要，而且电源插座很不合理，如果要插笔记本电源，需要把电视柜往前搬至少50厘米，否则你是找不到插孔的；3、订餐：按照《服务指南》，我打了8003，提示无此号码，于是拨打8006查询，告知我打8033，打过去以后又让我打8031，订个餐有这么麻烦吗？好不容易打通了，要了红烧草鱼、清炒土豆丝和紫菜汤，结果巨难吃，还不如外边随便一个小餐馆做的好吃，反而花了70多元，根本不是三星级酒店厨师做的，让人愤慨！紫菜汤的颜色就像是刷锅水！紫菜也是大片大片的！3、服务：打电话要了网线，过了很久，难道绿洲饭店很大吗？要走那么久？！绿洲饭店我已经住过好几次了，这次是最差劲的！！！给各位推荐立达宾馆，性价比很好，服务也特别好，而且做的菜很有家常口味，吃起来很可口！虽然远了一点，但是打车到市中心，也不过7元钱而已。唯一不足的就是没有宽带连接。补充点评2007年8月16日：还有一点最让人无法忍受：隔音太差了！我的房间隔壁住了个醉汉，那个呻吟声和鼾声，简直就像在同一个房间一样，而且看电视的声音和说话的声音都很清晰！,"The hotel is not like Samsung at all.1. The lobby: The acceptance is very slow, and the waiter will not even say hello; 2. The room: I booked a large bed room, the TV is very old, the place where the bathroom is bathing is separated by glass, and the space is very narrow and small., And the inside of the hot water is all brown -red rust, the temperature of the water is cold and hot during the bath; it is more abnormal that there is no reserve network line in the room, you have to call it, and the power socket is very unreasonable.In the laptop power, you need to move the TV cabinet at least 50 cm forward, otherwise you can't find the jack; 3.

1,我对这家酒店非常非常的满意！！在朋友的推荐下，订了丽江束河吉奥古客栈三天。首先要说一下丽江的出租车司机不能信！当天一下飞机就遇到了貌似老实善良的纳西出租车司机，他很热情的给我介绍了许多当地的特色，给了我许多建议，让我觉得很温暖，后来他问我有没有订到酒店，我说订了，是丽江束河的束奥古客栈，他说现在太晚了，我一个女孩子现在过去他的的出租车只能到古镇门口进不去，我一个人现在去那边不安全，他可以给我找一家条件相当而且价格便宜的酒店，当时一晕就相信了，结果他把我带到了城边一个小客栈，没有热水，没有服务员，没有空调，什么都没有，便宜倒是便宜了，才80元。出租车收了我120元。当晚在郁闷中渡过。第二天换到了吉奥古，感觉非常好，既可以享受纳西庭院暖暖的阳光，又可以享受现代酒店的舒适。一进门他们的员工在吃饭，老板娘就招呼我要不要一起吃，小弟就过来给我提行旅了，下午座在小院里和老板娘喝茶聊天（免费的哦）我才知道这家酒店入住三晚以上是免费接机的，三晚以下收80元（含过路费接机），丽江城随时免费接，可以直接联系0888-5136618。晚上老板娘去古城玩，就把我也带上了，座她的车去的，没有去酒吧街的酒吧，去了家原创民谣吧，感觉很好，叫D调，我只花了15元就听了一晚上的歌，晚上和老板娘一起回来。走的时候80元直接把我送机场，出租车要100元。这家酒店给我的感觉很好，因为就像到了朋友家。补充点评2008年3月25日：最要强调的一点就是丽江的出租车司机推荐的酒店千万不能信！！还有就是买东西的话束河比古镇要便宜许多。这家客栈的条件应该是束河最好的了，特别是卫生间，唯一不足的就是房间小了点，虽然是客栈地，但是比有的三、四星的条件还要好，关键是人很好玩，没有酒店的生硬，大家随意但不随便，特别是老板娘那种边玩边做的心态让你觉得真的很丽江！,"I am very, very satisfied with this hotel!IntersectionUnder the recommendation of a friend, the Lijiang Shuhe Jiuguku Inn was booked for three days.First of all, talk about Lijiang's taxi driver cannot believe it!On the same day, I encountered the Naxi taxi driver who seemed to be honest and kind.

The waiter No. 31 asked us when we left, and we said it was right.According to the convention, the waiter did not remind us to charge us over time, and we thought it would not be charged.So we ate and packed them in a hurry ... Waiting for us to check out for two points, we even took a half more for a long time!IntersectionDo not inform, do not remind, and the charges are not speechless, and the invoice is deducted from the deposit directly.Is this not a pitiest?IntersectionIntersectionWhat's even more ridiculous is that the 501 we live in is a sleeve. When we first entered, we didn't find the remote control of the TV, so we gave the front desk and sent a aunt to see it at the front desk.The aunt walked in the door and came out, and a sentence came out: ""It seems that 501 is no remote control.""After that, we found the remote control on the TV.Such a waiter and such a service really show Dunhuang!IntersectionBreakfast is also outrageous. At 8 o'clock, the porridge is cold ... Alas, this hotel, can't go!Intersection"
0,这个酒店在苏州的园区，位置相当远，房间也一般，好象原先这个楼不是设计为酒店的，因为在园区内这种楼都一个样子，我们是晚上入住酒店，可是从门口路过了两次都没有发现是酒店，最后问了路人才又折回去。第二天退房后又迷路了，转了一个圈子才找到大道。我想平时肯定很少人会去住这个酒店，出租车都会打不到，而且两天的房价都不一样，第二天的价格比第一天低。自已安慰自己是周末的因素吧。总之，价格高，路远，酒店很没有竞争力。,"This hotel is located in the park in Suzhou, with a very long location, and the room is average. It seems that the original building was not designed as a hotel, because this kind of building in the park is like one look.I did not find that it was a hotel, and finally asked the talents to fold it back.After checking out the next day, I lost my way, and I found a circle before I found the avenue.I think very few people will definitely go to this hotel, and the taxis will not be hit, and the two -day house prices are different. The price the next day is lower than the first day.I comfort myself as a weekend factor.In short, the price is high, the road is far, and the hotel is very competitive."
1,隔音效果确实不好，但好象还没到影响到睡眼，毕竟是走廊不是大街；但是在电梯里有湘西人（酒鬼酒开的）抽烟大谈牌经。让人不快！！！（没有看不起湘西人）,"The sound insulation effect is really not good, but it seems that it has not affected sleepy eyes. After all, it is a corridor and not a street;People are unhappy!IntersectionIntersection(No look down on Xiangxi people)"
1,安亭路是条很小的马路。离衡山路地铁站很近。环境好，是个闹中取静的地方。欧洲的老外会比较喜欢这种风格。,"Anting Road is a small road.It's close to Hengshan Road Metro Station.The environment is good, it is a place where you are in trouble.European foreigners prefer this style."
0,在酒店住的时候环境相当的差，卫生不打扫，前台服务态度相当的差，（个别的）还有那个保健中心的服务员素质太差，足浴不到时间就完事了，还理直气壮的说客人事多，找钱也不送的房间，就仍在门外，就敲了一下门就走了，出去看不见人，投诉到服务中心，服务中心的服务员说不是他们的事，建议服务上从内部抓起，提高服务素质。,"When the hotel lives, the environment is quite poor, the hygiene does not clean, and the front desk service attitude is quite poor. (Individual) and the waiter of the health center is too poor.There are many rooms that do n’t give out money, so I still go outside the door. I knocked on the door and left. When I went out, I could n’t see people. The waiter in the service center said that it was not their business.Get up, improve service quality."
1,酒店周围风景很好，在江边散步很惬意。但是房间里基本上只能看到一角。走到阳台上才能稍微看到多一点江景，不过不知道没有阳台的房间如何。房间很大很干净，硬件设备还算ok，前台小姐服务挺热情的，我们去的当天酒店有2个大团生意，但是对我们散客还是能够比较热情的接待，这点还是很满意的。,"The scenery around the hotel is very good, and walking on the river is very pleasant.But the room can only be seen in the room.You can see a little more river scenery on the balcony, but I don't know how the room without the balcony.The room is very large and clean. The hardware equipment is OK. The lady at the front desk is very enthusiastic. On the day we went to the hotel, there were 2 large groups in the hotel, but we could still be more enthusiastic about our scattered customers. This is still very satisfactory."
1,隔音较差，内部走廊的还好，但对外的很差，晚上快12点了，路上的车声喇叭声依然清晰可闻。其他的没什么，如家标准。,"The sound insulation is poor, and the internal corridor is okay, but it is very poor to the outside. It is almost 12 o'clock in the evening. The sound of the car horn on the road is still clearly heard.There is nothing else, such as home standards."
0,5月1日入住，其他地方没房间，定了锦地星座的特惠标准间，checkin的时候被告知升级到高级标准间，心里一阵暗喜，没想到经过一段乱糟糟的路（好像是厨房的外面）后，到了1号楼，进了房间更加失望，床小不说，还什么都没有，设施陈旧，马路上汽车的噪音更是让人难以忍受，洗个澡水流一地，哎，下次还不如去住个连锁商务酒店，同等的条件价钱最多只有2/3。,"Check in on May 1st, there are no rooms elsewhere, and the special standard room for the Jindi constellation is set. When I checkin, I was told to upgrade to the high -level standard room.Later, when I arrived at Building 1, I was even more disappointed when I entered the room.It is better to stay in a chain business hotel. The same conditions are only 2/3."

1,上周二又来住了。这次住的是大床房。有个最大的问题，给了我一间装修味道很浓的房间，进去以后一下子鼻子很不舒服，开窗开了大概半个多小时后才稍微好些。也没和顾客说最近装修啊，以后能不能不要给有装修味道的房间？,"I came to live again last Tuesday.This time I lived in a large bed.There was a biggest problem that gave me a room with a strong decoration. After entering, the nose was very uncomfortable. After opening the window for about half an hour, I was slightly better.I haven't told the customers recently decoration. Can you not give a room with decoration in the future?"
1,服务不错，不佳的地方是上网不方便，餐厅不理想。,"The service is good, the poor place is inconvenient to surf the Internet, and the restaurant is not ideal."
1,酒店有点老了。不过位置很不错。去那里都比较方便。。。,The hotel is a bit old.But the location is very good.It's more convenient to go there.EssenceEssence
0,1，整个房间找不到一个纸巾2厕所里没有抽风机，不知道是不是以前有人投诉过抽风机吵到人家睡不着就拆了，3煲水的水煲都没洗干净还有黑黑的水垢都有，连倒水出来哪里都还是有。4冲凉房踏脚塑胶超级脏，黑到可以吓死人。5电梯没有空调，在这样的大热天走进电梯没空调，焖在里面大家想想舒服吗？6我有一个朋友说走上楼上客房走廊好像走进桑拿了，说明走廊是多么的丑。7我在房间用完了的纸（这里指的是写东西的纸，像有些朋友经常出差在外难免要用纸张写东西）服务生收房间竟然不放纸。8新国际展览中心打的要12块，在展会出来打的居然没人知道那个酒店在那里，说在锦江之星哪里就有人知道，酒店在一个小巷里不好找。有一点好，门口就是小店。交通还好。周围没什么吃饭的地方，就有一家西餐厅，老外说不好吃，酒店本身有中餐，没去吃过不知道好不好吃。房间倒是还干净。早餐好难吃，东西又少还要20块。酒店前台服务马马虎虎，女人去问她什么她会不理不采的，建议女性朋友不要去住。以后不会再住这家酒店。,"1. I can't find a paper towel in the entire room. 2 There is no pump in the toilet. I don't know if someone had complained about the pumping fans before they couldn't sleep.There are scales, and there are still anywhere to pour water.4 The shower room is super dirty, black enough to scare people.5 The elevator has no air conditioning. Walking into the elevator in such a hot day, there is no air conditioner. Do you think it is comfortable?6 I have a friend who said that the corridor on the upstairs room seems to be walking into the sauna, indicating how ugly the corridor is.7 The paper I used in the room (here refers to the paper written by things, like some friends often travel out to write things out of the paper) The waiter collects the room without putting the paper.8 The new International Exhibition Center is 12 yuan.

1,我9号入住行政层（28楼），设施还好，服务不错，但电梯太老了。,"I stayed at the administrative level on the 9th (28th floor). The facilities were good and the service was good, but the elevator was too old."
1,"我和我老婆4月4日至6日入住该酒店，非常满意该酒店的服务，环境，服务都没得说，Checkin和Checkout的速度都是非常的快，早上9点多到酒店的时候，由于已经住满暂时没有房间可以入住，就先交了3000的押金（声明一下，这个只是用信用卡做个担保，并没有过账，所以感觉很好），然后可以免费寄存箱包，等到下午2点左右逛街回来，顺利入住，并且还免费提升到18层行政房，房间很宽敞，很干净，各种设施都很齐全，我和老婆住了两天都觉得非常满意，感觉物超所值，一晚上也只要961港元，换算人民币还不到900，在香港住感觉算是非常超值了，交通也非常方便，下楼就直接可以到旺角东站，直达罗湖，往返国内非常便捷，另外，出门就是注明的花园街（很多运动品牌的,价格比较公道），去尖沙咀的话，走十分钟到太子地铁站或者旺角地铁站都可以的，另外酒店还有定点免费到尖沙咀的巴士，由于我们一般很急忙的就出门了，没有来得及感受。总的来说，推荐大家来香港的时候尝试下这个酒店，价格和享受到的服务确实是成正比的。","My wife and I stayed at the hotel from April 4th to 6th. I was very satisfied with the hotel's service, environment, and services. The speed of Checkin and Checkout was very fast.Since there is no room for staying for the time being, you will pay a deposit of 3,000 first (declare that this is only a guarantee with a credit card, and it is not the account, so it feels good), and then you can store the bag for free.Come back to shopping, stay smoothly, and improve to the 18th floor administrative house for free. The rooms are spacious and clean. Various facilities are very complete. My wife and I have been very satisfied for two days.As long as HK $ 961, the conversion of RMB is less than 900. It feels very good to live in Hong Kong, and the transportation is very convenient. You can go directly to the East Railway Station of Mong Kok to Luohu.Ming Garden Street (many sports brands, the price is more fair). If you go to Tsim Sha Tsui, walk for ten minutes to the Prince Metro Station or Mong Kok Metro Station.Just go out and don't have time to feel.In general, when you recommend that you try this hotel when you come to Hong Kong, the price is indeed proportional to the service you enjoy."
1,"房间设施不错.可惜在省道旁边.晚上很吵.另外汽车停在宾馆外,早上发现一个胎坏了...周边居然有很多补胎的....总的来说,房间还算不错的.","The room facilities are good. Unfortunately, it is beside the provincial road. It is very noisy at night. In addition, the car is parked outside the hotel and found that a tire is broken in the morning ... There are many tires around ... in general, the room is pretty goodof."
1,酒店里面是新装修的，稍微有点味，服务员的态度还好啦！早餐很一般，如果是到杭州旅游的旅友们的话，建议入住这里，价格也比较实惠。,"The hotel is newly renovated. It is a bit delicious, and the attitude of the waiter is okay!Breakfast is very average. If it is travelers who travel to Hangzhou, it is recommended to stay here, and the price is relatively affordable."
1,酒店现在只送早餐了，中餐晚餐是10元的自助餐，相当不错。服务还可以，结账也很快。,"The hotel now only gives breakfast. The Chinese dinner is a buffet of 10 yuan, which is quite good.The service is okay, and the checkout is also very fast."
1,虽然外观不是很起眼，但房间内部还是不错的，毕竟是挂牌四星，该有的都有，浴袍也很舒服，酒店的早餐品种很多，地理位置的话算是市中心，但不是景点的中心，好在厦门城市不大，打车去各景点基本上不超过１５元．值得推荐的酒店．,"Although the appearance is not very eye -catching, the interior of the room is still good. After all, it is a list of four stars, and there should be everything. The bathrobe is also very comfortable. There are many types of breakfast in the hotel.Fortunately, Xiamen cities are not large, and they basically do not exceed 15 yuan to each attraction.Recommended hotels."
1,酒店本身的环境还是不错的，楼台庭阁，很安静，感觉就像住在园林里面。还有游泳池免费开放，让我们觉得很惊喜，可惜没带泳衣。房间一般，没什么特殊感觉，服务还不错，有服务生帮忙拿行李到房间（没给小费：－）），公司安排的出差，我自己定的酒店，结果回到广州才发现忘记拿发票，打电话给酒店，酒店同意给我寄过来，虽然是到付，但是还是很感激他们。就是没有电梯，楼很矮，好像只有3～4层吧。外面的环境就不是很好了，周边比较落后，距离镇中心还有10分钟车程。,"The environment of the hotel itself is still good. Tower Tingge is very quiet, and it feels like living in the garden.And the swimming pool is open for free, which makes us feel very surprised, but unfortunately we did not bring a swimsuit.The room is average, there is no special feeling, the service is not bad. Some waiters help get my luggage to the room (not tipping :-)). The business arranged by the company. As a result, when I returned to Guangzhou, I found that I forgot to get an invoice.The phone was given to the hotel and the hotel agreed to send me. Although it was paid, they were still grateful to them.There is no elevator, the building is short, it seems that there are only 3 to 4 floors.The outside environment is not very good, the surrounding is relatively backward, and there is still a 10 -minute drive from the town center."
1,四星级的酒店不错的，服务态度挺好，不是免费提供三餐，只是10块钱一份而已。房间干净、舒适，下次还住这。,"The four -star hotel is good, the service attitude is very good, not providing three meals for free, just 10 yuan a copy.The room is clean and comfortable, and I will live here next time."
1,确实是山上最好的酒店，环境和设施都很不错。我们这次住的是曙光别墅7201房，其他的别墅是竹木屋联排的，一排四间，我们这间是单独的且是水泥的，所以比较隔音，别墅区有3间这样的房间。设施齐全，有电吹风，水热也蛮大，没有空调，但山上晚上只有18度，用不上空调。我们上黄山是奥运前2天，天很好，所以房间还比较干燥，浴室有些潮，有2件羽绒服和加盖的被子。饭没有在宾馆吃，无法评价。服务还不错，动作挺快。,"It is indeed the best hotel on the mountain, and the environment and facilities are very good.This time we live in the dawn villa 7201 room. The other villas are lined up by bamboo and wooden houses. There are four rows. We are alone and cement, so it is relatively sound insulation. There are 3 such rooms in the villa area.The facilities are complete, there are hair dryers, and the water is quite large. There is no air conditioner, but there is only 18 degrees on the mountain at night.We went to Huangshan 2 days before the Olympic Games, and the sky was very good, so the room was relatively dry. There were some tide in the bathroom. There were 2 down jackets and quilt.The meal is not eaten in the hotel and cannot be evaluated.The service is not bad, and the movement is quite fast."
1,"很有品位的酒店,服务也非常到位.尤其感慨的是:能把酒店的客房布置成乡村旅舍的格调,既淳朴,又不失现代生活的方便,这个要赞一个!另外,酒店贴心的服务也让人感到温馨。入住酒店时，已经过8点，还没有就餐，酒店有位男性服务员（不知道是否是领班）脸上只出现了少许的犹豫，马上答应马上安排，让我们一家人真的很感动。菜品也很有特色。离开酒店的时候，想不到还有细致服务的感受，停车场服务员一见我发动汽车，马上过来递上免费的停车票，告知待会出去交给外面的收费员。这种细致的服务，确实体现了这个酒店的管理理念。提一个建议，从环城高速进入酒店的指示牌能否换成醒目点的，晚上入住酒店的时候，为找路花了不少的时间。","A very tasteful hotel, the service is also very in place. In particular, it is: it can arrange the hotel's rooms into the style of rural hostels, which is simple and convenient for modern life.It also makes people feel warm.When staying at the hotel, it was 8 o'clock. There was no meal yet. A male waiter (I don't know if it was a foreman) had a little hesitation on his face. He immediately promised to arrange immediately, which really moved our family.The dishes are also very distinctive.When I left the hotel, I couldn't think of the feeling of detailed service. When the parking lot waiter saw me starting the car, I immediately came over to deliver a free parking ticket to inform me that I would go out and give it to the toll collector outside.This meticulous service does reflect the management concept of this hotel.Make a suggestion, whether the signs that enter the hotel from Huancheng high speed can be replaced with eye -catching points. When you stay at the hotel at night, it takes a lot of time to find a way."
1,就在长途汽车站附近，步行10分钟吧。就是马路路口斜对过。在闹市区，路口有欧什么的西餐便餐店，环境不错。宾馆就是标准的4星，挺好的。附近还有kfc和农工商超市。,"Just near the long -distance bus station, walk for 10 minutes.The road is obliquely.In the downtown area, there are European food restaurants at the intersection, and the environment is good.The hotel is a standard 4 star, which is good.There are KFC and agricultural and industry supermarkets nearby."
1,"普遍都感到满意,只是房内浴室有点漏水及水龙头水力不足roomno.2105","It is generally satisfactory, but the bathroom in the room is a bit leak and the faucet is insufficient at Roomno.2105"
1,房间虽小，但设施齐全。服务很好，一直住这个酒店。,"Although the room is small, the facilities are complete.The service is very good, staying in this hotel."
1,地理位置优越，房间挺温馨，服务不错。商旅选择。,"The geographical location is superior, the room is very warm, and the service is good.Selection of business travel."
1,7号晚上到的，9号中午撤的。散布在绿树间的一幢幢俄式两层别墅，环境没的说，幽静，就是知了叫得太起劲（他们要到晚上12点左右才休息，早上6点多就有醒来歌唱的了）。离海边5、6分钟路程。宾馆内的瓦西里酒馆环境更没得说，而且价钱便宜，俄式味道也很地道，就是菜品少了点。因为这里还是外国专家疗养所，所以俄罗斯人比较的多。早餐一般般吧，牛奶比较稀，鸡蛋放的时间比较长，但吃了两天也就适应了。该说些不太满意的地方，房间大概好久都没有人住了，很潮，洗的游泳衣竟然到走也没有干，设施比较古老，但是还是很干净的，服务员很好。总体不错，但觉得除了房价其他的达不到3星的标准。补充点评2008年8月10日：因为对早餐不太满意，所以没有去餐厅吃过饭。,"On the evening of the 7th, it was withdrawn at noon on the 9th.The Russian -style two -story villas scattered between the green trees.

The milk is relatively sparse and the eggs are relatively long, but it is adapted for two days.It is time to say something that is not very satisfactory. The room has not lived in the room for a long time. It is very tide. The washing swimsuit did not do it.

1,"248元的单人大床房间的价格在这个山东物价消费最高的城市来说算是比较合理的了.房间比较宽敞,干净和整洁.早餐也不错,早餐水果的品种也比较的多.餐厅考虑充分考虑到单人点菜的分量,可以选择小盘,避免了不必要的浪费同时客人也能少花一些钱多点几个菜品尝.","The price of a single -person big bed room of 248 yuan is more reasonable in this city with the highest price consumption in Shandong. The room is relatively spacious, clean and tidy.Considering the weight of a single order, you can choose a small disk to avoid unnecessary waste.

1,除了价格有点偏高，其他相当满意。不过所谓的豪B在23－24层，普标倒在更高的楼层。所谓的海景房朝北和朝南的可以看到局部，朝东的对面有一个高楼，视野受影响。早餐不错，MS座位很少，最好错开高峰。豪标MS送水果和报纸。地理位置虽不是市中心，交通也还方便。马路对面就是大润发超市，购物餐饮都很方便。由于酒店23层以下是写字楼，所以大厅比较简陋，服务人员虽然态度不错，但是明显缺乏培训，很多事情爱莫能助。总之，是个值得推荐的酒店。,"In addition to the price is a bit high, others are quite satisfied.However, the so -called Hao B is on the 23-24 floors, and the general label fell on a higher floor.The so -called sea view house can be seen from north and south of the south. There is a high -rise building opposite to the east, and the vision is affected.Breakfast is good, there are very few MS seats, it is best to stagger the peak.Haojiao MS Send fruits and newspapers.Although the location is not in the city center, traffic is also convenient.Opposite the road is the Darunfa Supermarket, which is very convenient for shopping and catering.Because the hotel is below the 23rd floor of the hotel, the hall is relatively simple. Although the service staff has a good attitude, it is obviously lacking training. Many things can help.In short, it is a recommended hotel."

1,酒店房间还不错，很干净、水压很强，这里讲的标间一般是指酒店旁边的二层别墅的房间，但是如果CHECKIN时特别要求住前楼，也能住到，听说前楼有卡拉OK，5楼左右的客房都比较吵。我没有去住，住了两次，都是住后面的小楼，很安静。特别称赞酒店中餐点心，可以打电话叫客房送餐（在客房送餐简介上是没有的），打电话请总机转到一楼的中餐部，晚上12点还可以叫到点心，我叫了一份蒸排骨、一份牛肉丸、一份白粥，一共才二十元，真的很便宜，另外再说一下，中餐部的部长服务真的太热情了，竟然亲自将桌上纸巾袋内的纸巾一张张拿出来，递到客人面前。,"The hotel room is not bad. It is very clean and the water pressure is very strong. The standard room mentioned here generally refers to the room of the second -floor villa next to the hotel, but if you are specially required to live in the front building, you can live.Karaoke, the rooms around the 5th floor are more noisy.I didn't live, I lived twice, I lived in the small building behind, and it was very quiet.Special praise for the hotel's Chinese meals, you can call the guest room to deliver meals (not in the room for meals in the room). Call the header to transfer to the Chinese food department on the first floor. You can call the snack at 12 o'clock in the evening.Steamed ribs, a beef ball, and a white porridge, only 20 yuan in total, really cheap. In addition, the Minister of the Chinese Food Department is really enthusiastic, and he personally personally puts the paper towels on the paper towels on the table.Zhang Zhang took it out and handed it to the guest."
0,4月28日晚上1点多到酒店的，预定了一间商务我大床房，携程网站写明有免费宽带的，结果我在房间找了20多分钟，没找到网线，连网络接口都没有，只好打电话给总台，告诉我说，八楼在调试，禁止上网（当时给我的房间是6楼的），可以给我换房，因为要上网处理一些事务，无奈拿着行李到总台换房，又告知没有大床房了，只有标准间，价格和我预定的价格一样，因为太晚到酒店，自己也不好意思，所以没有理论，只好住了标准间。我有几点疑问：1。酒店深更半夜调试什么东东，而且8楼调试，6楼还不让上网？2。既然是调试，，暂时不能上网，为什么房间里没有网络接口？3如果总台早就知道这个情况，为什么我入住的时候不告诉我，非要等到我打电话的时候才说？4为什么第2天在6楼会议室开会的时候，又可以上网了？如果酒店连夜调试好了（虽然不知道调试什么东东），那他们的员工还真值得表扬！5为什么酒店前台总有那么多业务不熟悉的实习生在为我们服务？,"At more than 1 pm on April 28, I reached the hotel at 1 o'clock, and I booked a large bed room for business. The Ctrip website stated that there are free broadband. As a result, I found it in the room for more than 20 minutes., Had to call the head office and tell me that the eighth floor was debugging and prohibited the Internet (the room was on the 6th floor at the time). You can change the house for me, because you want to deal with it on the Internet, because you want to deal with it on the Internet.In the platform to change the house, I informed that there is no big bed room. There is only a standard room. The price is the same as the price I booked. Because I arrived at the hotel too late, I was embarrassed, so there was no theory, so I had to live in the standard room.I have a few questions: 1.What are the stuff to debug in the hotel in the middle of the night, and the on the 8th floor is debugging.2.Since it is debugging, it is temporarily unable to go online. Why is there no network interface in the room?3 If the main station knew this situation long ago, why did n’t I tell me when I checked in, and I had to wait until I called?4 Why can I get on the Internet again when I met in the conference room on the 6th floor on the 2nd day?If the hotel is debuged overnight (although I don't know what to debug), then their employees are really worthy of praise!5 Why do you always have so many business intern at the front desk of the hotel?"
0,房间真差啊，我住的是高级大床间，结果房间里一股油漆味...房间的卫浴系统太差了，都没能洗好澡，空调基本属于没有....,"The room is really bad. I live in a high -end bed. As a result, a paint flavor in the room ... The bathroom system in the room is too bad to take a bath. The air conditioner is basically no ..."
0,"我是在4月初住到这个酒店,住的是豪华商务单人间.版纳这里很热,晚上我热的睡不着觉,打电话问为什么没有空调,回答竟然是空调被人关了.整整两个晚上我基本上睡的很难受,因为版纳没有5星酒店,所以在ctrip上选的这个4星,但个人住的感觉,这个酒店的服务和招待所没有什么差别.晚上4点愤怒的问他们为什么热的人睡不着,他们说可以找个人过来给风机上放点冰块,投诉没有任何作用我便不需要他们的什么冰块了,第二天一大早就离开这个破地方最受不了的是他的早餐环境很差,东西口味很一般,品种也太少各位,等你们住了这里就知道这个酒店有多么的搞笑.","I stayed in this hotel in early April, and I lived in a luxury business single room. Pyana was very hot here. I couldn't sleep hot at night. I called and asked why there was no air conditioner. The answer turned out to be closed.I basically sleep uncomfortably at night, because the version has no 5 -star hotel, so I chose this 4 -star in CTRIP, but the feeling of personal living, there is no difference between the service and hospitality of this hotel. I asked them why they angrily in the evening.Hot people can't sleep. They said that they could find someone to put some ice on the fan. If there is no effect on complaints, I don't need their ice cubes. I left this breaking place early the next morning.It is his breakfast environment is very poor, the taste of things is very average, and there are too few varieties. When you live, you will know how funny this hotel is."
0,大年初一入住的，酒店的装修不错，可是前台服务就一位男生，态度很冷淡，感觉不希望我们入住似的，因为是探亲的所以就晚上住一下，所以订了标准房，他一开口就要我们加钱换好点的房间，我们就是冲那个价去的，如果要出四百多我们选择其他酒店了，也不会住他家了，地方那么偏，于是他给我们了普通的房间，那个房间真是小啊，比一百元多的连锁酒店还小，装修不错，床比较舒服，不过下次肯定不会住这家了。不实惠，而且因为在网上看到送迷你吧和可以免费去植物园的，前台的也没有交代这些事情，如果没有在网上看到的人肯定不知道的。,"In the first day of the New Year, the hotel's decoration was good, but the front desk service was a boy, and his attitude was very cold. I didn't want us to stay in. Because I was visiting relatives, I lived at night. Therefore, I booked a standard room.When you open your mouth, we need to add money to the room where the money is changed.In the room, that room is really small. It is smaller than the chain hotel of more than 100 yuan. The decoration is good and the bed is more comfortable, but it will definitely not live in this house next time.It is not embarrassing, and because you see the mini bar on the Internet and those who can go to the botanical garden for free, the front desk will not explain these things. If you do not see the people on the Internet, you will definitely not know."
1,友谊宾馆环境绝对是一流的，服务态度更是让人心旷神怡。我们全家在此渡过了美好的三天，感谢酒店的良好服务，更感谢携程的准确预订。唯一不足的是，友谊宾馆房间无服务指南，哪怕是简单的提示，如餐厅位置、就餐时间、价格等，虽然服务员能热情解答，但总是感觉不太方便。补充点评2008年8月1日：对了还有一点，去海滩游泳非常方便，在酒店换好衣服就可以了，回来冲洗温水澡，真是舒服。下次去度假一定还选这里。,"The environment of the friendship hotel is definitely first -class, and the service attitude is even more refreshing.Our family has been here for three days, thank you for your good service, and thank you for your accurate booking.The only disadvantage is that there is no service guide in the room room of Friendship Hotel, even if it is a simple reminder, such as the location of the restaurant, dining time, price, etc., although the waiter can answer warmly, it is always not convenient.Supplementary comment on August 1, 2008: By the way, it is very convenient to go to the beach. You can change your clothes in the hotel. It is really comfortable to take a warm bath.I will choose here next time."
1,新装修，比较干净；房间内有免费上网。自助早餐38元，有点贵，但有不少本地小吃。价格在当地不算便宜。离市中心不远，但是打的士并不方便。总体感觉还是很不错的酒店。,"New renovation, relatively clean; free Internet access in the room.The buffet breakfast is 38 yuan, which is a bit expensive, but there are many local snacks.The price is not cheap in the local area.Not far from the city center, but the taxi is not convenient.The overall feeling is still very good."
0,以为和温州的华侨饭店一个系统，入住发现像校办酒店，房间隔音很差，而且不仅是左右，楼上的动静也听的到，房间有一股陈年的霉味，行政房就是大些，湖景一般，是湖的一小部分。服务像国企。,"I think that a system with the Overseas Chinese Hotel in Wenzhou found that it was like a school -run hotel. The room sound insulation was poor, and it was not only about left and right.The lake view is a small part of the lake.Services like state -owned enterprises."
0,在天津星尔特大酒店丢失白金项链一条，未能找回。客人洗澡时摘下，放在床头柜上，走时忘记拿，结果丢失。,"Lost a platinum necklace at the Star Hot Hotel in Tianjin and failed to find it.The guest took off while taking a bath, put it on the bedside table, and forgot to take it at the time of walking, but lost."
1,"人家特地让我来表扬这里的,价格很便宜,服务很好.房间很好,就是小了点.宾馆反馈2008年5月9日：嘿嘿,多谢您的鼓励,有了您的支持,相信我们会做得更好的！","People specifically asked me to praise here. The price is very cheap and the service is very good. The room is very good. It is a little smaller. Hotel feedback on May 9, 2008: Hey, thank you for your encouragement, with your support, I believe usWill do better!"
1,我个人认为还是一间过得去的酒店，但是和其五星标准相比还有一定差距，主要是房间内设施比较陈旧。,"I personally think that it is still a hotel that is available, but there is still a certain gap compared to its five -star standard, mainly because the facilities in the room are relatively old."
1,第一次给的房间在底层，窗户对着酒吧。跟前台要求换了一间，前台态度不错，在三层，一般窗户被前面的应该是走廊的建筑挡住了，另一半朝着酒吧上的屋顶。房间偏小，软件应该能达到三星级的水准，硬件稍差。空调温控不好，暴热，呵呵。地毯有点脏。出门左转50米就是地铁站，东四十条上打个车也方便，地段不错。总体来说在北京这个性价比还过得去。餐厅的口味也不错，价格还算合理。,"The first room given is at the bottom, the window is facing the bar.I changed to one room with the front desk. The front desk was in good attitude. On the three floors, the general windows should be blocked by the building in front of the corridor, and the other half towards the roof on the bar.The room is small, the software should be able to reach the level of three -star, and the hardware should be slightly worse.The air conditioning temperature control is not good, hot, haha.The carpet is a bit dirty.Turn left 50 meters to the subway station. It is also convenient to take a car on the east of 40s. The location is good.Generally speaking, the cost -effectiveness in Beijing is still available.The taste of the restaurant is also good, and the price is quite reasonable."
1,"山水宾馆的设施比较旧,餐厅也是比较旧,住宿不含早餐,需要另交费.","The facilities of the landscape hotel are relatively old, and the restaurant is relatively old."
1,不错。交通十分方便，房间较宽敞，特别是卫生间，中心房没窗户，但并没有明显的不通气的感觉。我住的那天有许多貌似中东来的客人，不知平时是否也是这样。,"good.The transportation is very convenient. The room is relatively spacious, especially the bathroom. There is no window in the central room, but there is no obvious feeling of indentation.On the day I lived, there were many guests who came from the Middle East. I wonder if this is the same."
1,"这样的硬件,这样的价钱,在香港是绝对超值的.保持了喜达屋的一贯高水准.如果去中环的班车免费就更完美了.","Such a hardware, such a price, is absolutely value -for -money in Hong Kong. It has maintained the consistent high level of Starwood. It is more perfect if the shuttle bus to Central is free."
0,如果去周庄旅游，体验水乡风情的，还是去景区里面的私人旅馆比较好，环境不比私人旅馆好，服务我觉得也不好！本来去市区的班车就少，一个半小时一辆了，那天我赶着去浦东机场，他索性还说班车取消了一班，让我足足等了2个小时50分钟。。。。。。。,"If you travel to Zhouzhuang and experience the style of the water village, it is better to go to a private hotel in the scenic area. The environment is not better than a private hotel. I think it is not good to serve!There were fewer shuttle buss in the urban area, each half an hour and a half. I rushed to Pudong Airport that day. He simply said that the shuttle bus was canceled for 2 hours and 50 minutes.EssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssence"
1,"非常不错的一个酒店,我住的是标准大房,388一晚,很值,需要提点意见就是厕所里的地板排水严重不行.冲完凉后厕所地板上的水一直流不走,最后没办法拿浴巾来当地板...中餐不错,床.简直就一个爽字.超大!","A very nice hotel, I live in a standard big room, 388 a night, it is worth it.

1,"2月14日入住,服务不错,服务员很热情,会主动问好;退房延后一小时也很容易就答应了.硬件差点,房间有点旧,我订的是山海房,只能看到一点点海,房间隔音不好,入住第一天时听到了别人房间里MAKELOVE的声音,很大动静很清楚.二楼中餐厅价格在亚龙湾大概算便宜的反正比百花谷的彩蝶轩便宜,而且口味更适合北方人.早餐也很好品种很全,158元的自助晚餐一般只比早餐多出一些烧烤的东西而已,因为天气冷也没有表演.","Check in on February 14th, the service is good, the waiter is very enthusiastic, and will take the initiative to ask hello; it is easy to agree to the postponing one hour. The hardware is almost old. The room is a bit old.Hai, the room's sound insulation is not good. On the first day of staying, I heard the sound of Makelove in other people's room.It is more suitable for northerners. Breakfast is also very good. The 158 yuan buffet dinner is generally only more barbecue than breakfast, because the weather is cold and there is no performance."
1,"装修风格简洁时尚,感觉相当不错的酒店.只是对配套餐厅比较失望,先是衣宵供应时间较不方便,上次因为我的飞机比较晚,到酒店晚上10:10左右,酒店的中餐厅已经停止供应了,送餐服务牌上的餐品又少的可怜....还有十分不可理解的就是第二天早餐时,居然看见蟑螂穿梭于的众多的食品当中....当时我告诉了服务员,他拿了纸巾从容的去抓小强,看他的表情感觉已经不是第一次了,而且也没人对我表示报歉宾馆反馈2008年7月16日：首先非常感谢阁下入住我们酒店，并给予我们中肯的评价。关于阁下反映的中餐厅夜宵供应时间不方便的问题，中餐厅的营业时间是：8:00-14:30,17:00-22:30。客房内除了提供便捷夜宵餐牌，还有24小时服务的全日送餐餐牌，内有多款中、西美食供客人选择。关于阁下反映的卫生问题，由此给阁下带来的不安我们深感歉意。出现这种情况，我们感到非常惊讶与不解。酒店管理层已经与相关部门开会讨论，决定再次全面检查，再加强清洁卫生工作。期待阁下再次光临。","The decoration style is simple and stylish, and it feels quite good. It is just disappointed with the supporting restaurant. The supply time of Yi Xiao is less convenient. Last time, because my plane was relatively late, at the hotel around 10:10 in the evening, the Chinese restaurant in the hotel had stopped.After supplying, there are few meals on the food delivery service card ... and what is very incomprehensible is that during the breakfast the next day, I actually saw the many foods that the cockroaches shuttled through ...The waiter, he took the paper towels calmly to grab Xiaoqiang.

0,上次入住，半夜两点，宾馆突然测试电压，将我的笔记本适配器以及手机充电器全部烧坏，幸亏笔记本电脑处于关闭状态以及手机没有插在充电器上，否则不堪设想；而且上次入住早晨停电，没有早饭、洗脸水都没有，东北人的服务意识太差。,"Last time, at two o'clock in the middle of the night, the hotel suddenly tested the voltage to burn my laptop adapter and mobile phone charger. Fortunately, the laptop was closed and the mobile phone was not inserted on the charger, otherwise it would be unimplencing;There is no breakfast or facial washing water, and the service awareness of the Northeast people is too poor."

0,我朋友说要去延庆张山营镇政府附近办事，我听都没听说过这地方，帮他定了这个说是最近的酒店，去了只有他一个人住，360就包个酒店还是第一次哟！房间很一般，周边太安静了，如果想热闹又有逛有吃的朋友还是建议去延庆中心住，县就只有那边大，走哪儿走不算远，打车也方便！,"My friend said that he was going to work near the government of the Zhangshanying Town of Yanqing. I have never heard of this place. I helped him determine that it was the nearest hotel. I went to live alone.Once!The room is very average. The surrounding area is too quiet. If you want to live in a lively and eat, you still recommend living in Yanqing Center. The county is only big there."
1,通过携程预定的银瑞林酒店，环境及服务令我们非常满意，特别是前台确认房间时，在房间不够的情况下为我们及时做了免费升级，温馨的服务给我们留下了难忘的印象。,"Through the Yinreilin Hotel booked by Ctrip, the environment and services are very satisfied with the environment and services. Especially when the front desk confirms the room, the room has made a free upgrade for us in a timely manner, and the warm service leaves us an unforgettable impression."
1,我住的房间隔音不好.设计有缺陷.万州还有一家四星的国际酒店.好像携程没有协议.,The room I live in is not good. The design is defective. Wanzhou also has a four -star international hotel. It seems that Ctrip does not have an agreement.
1,我住的商务单人间，酒店周边环境一般般，但房间比较大，床软硬适中，上网速度快，早餐很丰盛是我没想到的。以后可能还会入住,"I live in a business single room. The surrounding environment of the hotel is general, but the room is relatively large, the bed is soft and moderate, the Internet speed is fast, and the breakfast is very rich. I did not expect it.Maybe you will stay in the future"
1,"在南阳来讲总体还行,毕竟可选择少少,总体性价比有些偏高些","In Nanyang, the overall is okay."
1,酒店的房型比较有限，不过商务标准间还是不错的，设施服务还算到位的，不过这次入住的房间是最边上的房间，房间的温度比较低，保温性较差，自助式的早餐和午餐口味还可以，价位适中，这个酒店不缺的就是客源虽然位置偏僻，出租车比较少，但去开发区办事是最方便的了。,"The hotel's room type is relatively limited, but the business standard room is still good. The facility services are still in place. HoweverThe taste of lunch is okay. The price is moderate. Although the source of this hotel is not the location of the customer, the taxi is relatively small, but it is the most convenient to go to the development zone."
1,"从地段,星级,价格,环境和设施考虑,此酒店相当不错.如果没有其他因素,下次还会再住.为使贵酒店良性发展,特提醒几点:1.酒点总台服务小姐不够专业,没有职业笑容.2.房间(1117)水龙头和下水出问题,有人报修和管理吗?这牵涉到资源,成本,信誉和服务.3.空调整夜发出流水的噪声(分贝可能不小于50),可能会影响许多客人的休息.希望下次来住时得到改观.","From the section, star, price, environment and facilities, this hotel is quite good.

0,1、大床房其实是一个很小的房；2、新装修的房其实一点都不新，看起来挺旧的。补充点评2008年5月23日：我入住的是新装修的豪华房,"1. The large bed room is actually a small room; 2. The newly renovated room is actually not new at all, and it looks pretty old.Supplementary comment on May 23, 2008: I stayed in the newly renovated luxury room"
1,宾馆环境不错，比较安静，住了两晚标间，房间超级大，我从来没有住过这么大的标间。但是地毯有点脏，家具的摆放也有问题，电视离床太远了。早餐不像四星的，太简单了。,"The hotel has a good environment and is relatively quiet. I lived in the standard room for two nights. The room was super big. I never lived in such a big standard room.However, the carpet was a bit dirty, and there was a problem with the placement of furniture. The TV was too far away.Breakfast is not like four stars, it is too simple."
0,"这家酒店是我在携程定的酒店里面是最差的，房间设施太小气，环境也不好，特别是我住的那天先是第一晚停了一会儿电，第二天停水，没法洗嗽，就连厕所也没法上，糟糕头顶。服务还可以。宾馆反馈2008年5月5日：首先非常感谢您对我店提出的看法.对于在您入住期间本店给您带来的不便,我们深表歉意.今后我们一定会避免类似事件的发生,为您的出行提供更多的方便,希望您下次还来,我们会努力做好的!","This hotel is the worst in the hotel I set in Ctrip.

We apologize for the inconvenience of our store during your stay. In the futureThe travel of travel provides more convenience. I hope you will come back next time, and we will work hard!"
1,因为没有安静的大床房间可以安排，最后只能住标准间，房间挺大，但床还是小了点。因为只是睡了一觉，没什么特别的感受。服务员的态度很不错，还有早餐，表扬一下。,"Because there is no quiet large bed room, you can only be arranged. In the end, you can only live in the standard room. The room is quite large, but the bed is still a little smaller.Because I just slept, there was nothing special.The waiter's attitude is very good, and breakfast, praise."
0,服务很不好，第一天到前台登记入住时，因为对预授权的签字有质疑，前台接待竟然对我说，如果你不愿意签字，请让其他人帮你付钱（这个回答简直让人无语）！第二天结帐时，用了另外一张信用卡结帐，之前用于押金的卡的预授权不能解冻，告知需要10到15天才可以，和前台理论，要见值班经理，通知要15天到1个月才可以解冻，着急办事，先走了。后来打电话询问被告知要45天。心中觉得诧异打电话至银行，得知酒店方如果不做任何处理，自然解冻至少45天。如果要提前解冻，要酒店发传真给银行。对他们的解释及其处理的行为是在感到很气愤，这样的酒店还能上4星，服务太差了，不管是软件的还是硬件的，硬件的提高可以花钱，人员素质的提高是花钱也买不来。,"Speechless)!When checking out the next day, I used another credit card to check out. The pre -authorization of the card used for the deposit before it could not be thawed. It was tested for 10 to 15 days.It can be thawed in 1 month, hurried to work, and left first.Later, I called and asked about it for 45 days.I felt surprised to call the bank in my heart and learned that if the hotel party did not do any treatment, it naturally thawed for at least 45 days.If you want to thaw in advance, you want the hotel to send faxes to the bank.The explanation of them and their treatment are very angry. Such a hotel can still be on 4 stars, and the service is too bad. Whether it is software or hardware, the improvement of hardware can cost money.I can't buy money."
1,周边环境好，安静，交通也方便，房间很干净，服务比较热情，特别是大堂人员训练有序。可能是由于在啤酒节前，房价涨的比较多一些，据出租车司机讲，平时还是比较便宜的。酒店就在海边，但离海滨浴场相对其他海边酒店来说，稍微远了一点，但因为青岛出租车便宜，所以也无所谓,"The surrounding environment is good, quiet, transportation is also convenient, the room is very clean, and the service is more enthusiastic, especially the lobby personnel training is orderly.It may be because before the beer festival, house prices have risen more. According to taxi drivers, it is usually cheaper.The hotel is at the beach, but it is a little farther away from other seaside hotels from the seaside bath, but because Qingdao taxis cheap, it doesn't matter"
1,称作4星，有点牵强，不过酒店下面的朝鲜料理还可以，还有歌舞，的确不错。想感受一下朝鲜风格，还是可以一试的。,"It is called 4 stars, which is a bit far -fetched, but the Korean cuisine below the hotel is OK, and there are singing and dancing, which is indeed good.If you want to feel the Korean style, you can still try it."
0,比较实惠，旁边有易初莲花，买东西比较方便，还有麦当劳,It is more affordable. There is a lotus lotus next to it. It is more convenient to buy things.
0,酒店周边比较繁华，对面有必胜客。服务热情还可以，设施就不是一般的差，第一个房间网口坏了不能上网，换个房间，水蓬头不出水，郁闷，各位还是不要去了。,"The hotel is relatively prosperous, and there is a winner on the opposite side.The service enthusiasm is okay, the facilities are not generally bad. The first room network is broken and cannot access the Internet. Change the room. The water unkelet does not get out of the water. I still do n’t want to go."
1,已经去过一次了，这次也是从携程订的房间，但是好像跟前台沟通的不好，到了居然找不到我们的名字，奇怪,"I have been there once, this time it is also a room ordered from Ctrip, but it seems that it is not good to communicate with the front desk."
1,早餐是中式，有些东西很奇怪。住店停车还收费，不应该。,"Breakfast is Chinese, and some things are strange.Store parking is also charged, not."
1,地理位置位置很好，我们订的是主楼的标间，正好在南边，晚上的运河很漂亮。就是房间小了点，电视也不是很清楚。,"The geographical location is very good. We order the standard room of the main building, which is just south. The canal at night is beautiful.The room is a bit smaller, and the TV is not very clear."
0,"最好别去,很差,看完很差想换酒店,他们竟跟我要服务费.也没待那房间2分种,居然解决了问题,可觉的下次不能去的,","It's best not to go, it's bad. After reading it, I want to change the hotel. They asked me to ask me for a service fee. I didn't wait for the room for 2 points. I actually solved the problem."
1,在那里真让人。。。在房间里有明示卡说明冰箱内的饮料为免费的，但总台结帐时告知要收费，6瓶饮料收费100多元，自己是做酒店的还能说什么呢？同行多包容点吧，但这确实不好，注意给客人的感受。要说四星级似乎还差点，我仅指客房内的面积与硬件水平及舒适程度,"It is really there.EssenceEssenceIn the room, there is a clear indication card that the drinks in the refrigerator are free, but when the main station checks out, it is told to charge. 6 bottles of drinks cost more than 100 yuan. What can I say when I do a hotel?Let's be more tolerant, but this is really not good, pay attention to the feelings of the guests.To say that the four -star level seems to be almost, I only refer to the area and hardware level and comfort in the room"
0,"由于飞机晚点,我到达酒店的时候已经凌晨2点,酒店的服务生好象根本就没有想到那个时候还会有客人入住,(也许是一个临时的员工),一切的手续办理都显得不熟练.","Because the plane was late, it was 2 am when I arrived at the hotel. The waiter of the hotel did not expect that there would be guests at that time at that time. (Maybe it was a temporary employee). All procedures were unfamiliar."
1,很不错的酒店，房间超大，很安静。为什么珠海海边的酒店就做不到。不过携程的价格没有优势，前台可以办理会员，积分永远有效，直接订房还比携程的价格便宜。,"Very good hotel, the room is large and quiet.Why can't the hotels in Zhuhai?However, Ctrip's price has no advantage. The front desk can handle members. Points are always effective. Direct reservation is cheaper than Ctrip's price."
1,酒店位置很好，直接面对刘公岛，晚上在海堤边有自助烧烤58元/位。房间设施较新，但装修较为粗糙，天花涂层有多处起泡。早餐还算丰富，总体还不错。,"The hotel location is very good, facing Liu Gong Island directly, at night, there is a buffet barbecue of 58 yuan/person at the beings.The room facilities are relatively new, but the decoration is relatively rough, and there are many foaming in the smallpox coatings.Breakfast is quite rich and overall."
0,"我住241房间,比较安静,地痰很旧,上面还有很多毛头.早餐非常简单,很差,我觉得200多的酒店这种水平还能将就,连牛奶的味道都很淡,除了桔子和小番茄,就没有水果了,而且每天早上要去总台领餐,这也很离谱,即使我们不嫌烦,也增加总台工作量,况且早晨总会有人退房.本来房间送瓶装水是好事,但是那个水质量实在太差,首先瓶子就发黑,而且各个瓶子发黑程度不同,没有开启的时候手捏就很软,明显就是回收原料做的(违法的)(本人就是搞塑料材料的,所以敢这样说,水也有股怪味道,这个实在太过分虽然前面有的评价说这个价格对这个质量还是合适的,那我想说,你们仔细找找,北京远有比它价低,质优的酒店.","I live in Room 241, which is relatively quiet, the sputum is very old, and there are many hairs on it. The breakfast is very simple and poor. I think the level of more than 200 hotels can still be as light as the taste of milk.There are no fruits of oranges and small tomatoes, and we have to go to the main station to receive meals every morning. This is also outrageous. Even if we are not annoying, we will increase the workload of the main station. Moreover, there will always be people check out in the morning.Water is a good thing, but the quality of the water is too bad. First of all, the bottle is black, and the degree of darkness of each bottle is different. It is very soft when it is not opened.Plastic materials, so dare to say that water also has a strange taste. Although this price is too much, this price is still suitable for this quality, then I want to say, you can find it carefully.Low, high -quality hotels."
1,在甘肃能有这样一个酒店实属不易，比阳光大厦好很多，无论从硬件设施还是服务水平都一流，建议：游泳池太冷，房费含上早餐,"It is not easy to have such a hotel in Gansu, which is much better than the Sunshine Building. Both the hardware facilities and the service level are first -rate. It is recommended that the swimming pool is too cold and the room fee contains breakfast"
1,"不错的酒店,女儿很喜欢,尤其是室外游泳池,很对小孩子的胃口补充点评2008年8月11日：我定的旅游套餐包括送早餐,早餐是来了米老鼠,唐老鸭和高飞狗,相当不错.不过,正如前面一位同仁所说,他们对老外的小孩却实特别热情,不能比...","Good hotels, daughters like it very much, especially outdoor swimming pools, which are very good for children's appetite. Comment on August 11, 2008: My decided travel package includes breakfast, breakfast is coming from Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Gao FeiDogs, pretty good. However, as a colleague said in front, they are very enthusiastic about children of foreigners. They cannot be compared with ..."
1,地理位置不错，走到繁华地段很方便。酒店设施还算很新。当地最好的酒店。大家注意，房间有江景房和山景房，山景房房间比江景房大，感觉内部比江景房舒服，虽然根本没什么山景可谈。江景房其实有两种，预订的时候一定要选择有阳台并且可以看到大桥的，否则就是没阳台并且只能看到一点点江的房间，切记。底楼有足浴，正规的，不错,"The geographical location is good, and it is convenient to walk to the bustling location.Hotel facilities are quite new.The best local hotel.Everyone has noticed that the rooms have riverside houses and mountain view rooms. The mountain view rooms are larger than the river view room. It feels that the inside is more comfortable than the Jiangjingfang. Although there is no mountain view at all.There are actually two types of Jiangjingfang. When booking, you must choose a balcony and you can see the bridge. Otherwise, you can only see a room without a balcony and only see a little bit of Jiang. Remember.There are foot baths on the bottom floor, formal, good"

1,豪华客房很不错，有客厅，房间卫生打扫不错，酒店人员算比较殷勤。但是提供的洗浴用品质量平平。自助餐算对得起这个等级（3星到4星）的水准。,"The luxury rooms are very good. There are living rooms, the room sanitary cleaning is good, and the hotel staff is more diligent.However, the quality of the bathing products provided is mediocre.The buffet is worthy of this level (3 stars to 4 stars)."
1,经常入住的酒店，服务和设施都很理想，还会再去,"Hotels, services and facilities that often stay in"
1,"地理位置不错,房间在香港来说,算大的,特别是卫生间很大,硬件比较旧.住这里只是涂个方便.只是这次的时机不对,遇上会展,价格大概别平时贵上2-3倍哦.平时的话,2000多能","The geographical location is good. In Hong Kong, the room is large, especially the bathroom is large, and the hardware is older. It is just convenient to live here. It ’s just that the time is wrong.3 times. Usually, more than 2000 can"
1,酒店的服务非常好。房间里也停安静的。唯一的不足是空调系统的噪音太大。,The hotel's service is very good.The room was also quiet.The only deficiency is that the noise of the air -conditioning system is too much.
1,"总的来说对厦门宾馆感觉不错.我们订了8号楼一间大床房(15层),一间双床房(11层),总共住了6个晚上.房间比较宽敞,硬件设施稍显陈旧,例如灯光的开关控制感觉不是很方便智能,其他方面还好.服务员都彬彬有礼,给人训练有素,温暖热情的感觉.早餐品种还算丰富,我个人比较喜欢面线糊,鸭肉粥.牛奶豆浆刚去的时候感觉味道淡,提了意见后有明显改进.3层的中餐做得很不错,包间服务很好,我们那天是一个很年轻的男服务生,却非常细心周到妥贴.周围环境很好,3号楼是泰国领事馆.交通便利,打车去轮渡8元+1元燃油费.总之感觉宾馆胜在服务和环境.相比之下,去鹭江宾馆的6层用过两次餐,可能是生意太好的缘故,有些服务员很不耐烦,态度生硬,让人感觉很不舒服,虽然小吃做得不错.","Generally speaking, it feels good for Xiamen Hotel. We ordered a large bed room (15th floor), a double bed room (11th floor) in Building 8, and lived in a total of 6 nights.Old old, such as the switch control of lighting is not very convenient and intelligent. Other aspects are good. The waiters are polite and give people a well -trained, warm and enthusiastic feeling. Breakfast varieties are quite rich. I personally prefer noodle paste. I personally prefer noodle paste.Duck porridge. Milk soymilk feels light when I first gone. After the opinion, there are obvious improvements. The Chinese food on the 3rd floor is very good, and the private room service is very good. We were a very young male service that dayThroughout and appropriate. The surrounding environment is very good. Building 3 is the Thai Consulate. Convenient transportation. Take a taxi to ferry 8 yuan+1 yuan fuel fee. In short, it feels that the hotel is victorious in service and environment.It has been used twice for the layer. It may be because the business is too good. Some waiters are impatient, their attitudes are stiff, making people feel uncomfortable, although the snacks are good."
1,"环境是很不错的,很漂亮,就是免费升级的事没有事先通知,让客人受到了不平等的待遇.意见很大.中餐不错,西餐太不地道.房间价格很便宜,套房很大,早餐也不错。","The environment is very good, very beautiful, that is, the free upgrade is not notified in advance, so that the guests have been treated inequality. The opinions are very good. Chinese food is good, Western food is not authentic.good."
0,"酒店实在太差了,房间隔音极差,北塔挨着迪吧，快曲放到半夜3点；换到南塔，又挨着KTV音乐响到半夜2点，根本睡不着觉！换房间的时候服务员态度又很差，真是从来没住过这么差的酒店","The hotel is too bad. The room's sound insulation is very poor. The North Tower is next to Di, and the fast song is placed at 3 o'clock in the middle of the night. Instead, it is changed to the South Tower, and the KTV music sounds until 2 o'clock in the middle of the night.When changing the room, the waiter's attitude is very poor."
0,自称4星，实际上顶多2星。贵宾楼比较好，房内还挺干净。,"To claim 4 stars, in fact at most 2 stars.The VIP tower is better, and the room is quite clean."
1,我们住的是三楼的房间，房间不大（大约20平米），是新装修的，还不错。最大的特色是房间的镜子特多而且浴室是全部用玻璃间隔的，可以从房间看到浴室里面的所有东西。酒店离地铁不近，但附近巴士很方便，从酒店门口过隧道坐1A/9/5C到尖沙咀和旺角只要HKD5-6.2，坐107到海洋公园11块多，回程的话，在酒店楼下就是巴士站。购物的话，在九龙寨城公园旁边就是九龙城广场，里面除了有吉之岛十元店和百佳外，还有很多私人的小铺。餐厅包括KFC、麦当劳、和其他一些香港比较出名的外资餐厅。总体来讲，该酒店在香港的性价比算挺高的，值的去住。,"We live in the room on the third floor. The room is not large (about 20 square meters). It is newly renovated and pretty good.The biggest feature is that there are many mirrors in the room, and the bathrooms are used in glass interval. You can see everything in the bathroom from the room.The hotel is not close to the subway, but the nearby buses are very convenient. Take 1A/9/5C from the tunnel at the entrance of the hotel to Tsim Sha Tsui and Mong Kok as long as HKD5-6.2, and take 107 to Ocean Park.stand.For shopping, next to Jiulongzhai City Park is Jiulong City Plaza. In addition to Ji Zhima Island Shimi Shop and Baijia, there are many private shops.The restaurant includes KFC, McDonald's, and other well -known foreign restaurants in Hong Kong.Generally speaking, the hotel's cost performance in Hong Kong is quite high, and it is worthwhile."
0,房间感觉还可以，但是洗漱用的毛巾浴巾质量不好，感觉没有洗干净，房间隔音效果不好,"The room feels okay, but the quality of the towels for washing is not good, it feels not cleaned, and the room sound insulation effect is not good"
1,我在该宾馆入住了大约有20几次了吧，主要是觉得位置不错，交通方便。觉得难以忍受的是床垫实在是太太太硬了。,"I stayed in the hotel about 20 times, and I mainly feel that the location is good and the traffic is convenient.What I feel unbearable is that the mattress is really hard."
1,住了这家饭店，感觉还不错，没有网络上评论的那么差，开始看到网络上的评论还担心这家饭店不好，看来是多余了！刚进大厅竟然在显示屏上有自己的名字，真的感觉很惊喜！这里服务员很热情，床虽然小了一点，但很干净整洁，服务也很周到！这的地理位置也不错，靠近市中心，出门就有去莫高窟的车，这次敦煌之行还算愉快！！,"I stayed in this restaurant and felt pretty good. It was not as poor as comments on the Internet. I started to see the comments on the Internet and worry that this hotel is not good. It seems that it is superfluous!I just entered the lobby to have my own name on the display, and I really felt surprised!The waiter here is very enthusiastic. Although the bed is a little smaller, it is clean and tidy, and the service is very thoughtful!This geographical location is also good. Near the city center, there are cars to Mogao Grottoes when they go out. This time, the Dunhuang trip is quite pleasant!Intersection"
1,桐庐是个小县城，一共从南到北开车要不了20分钟。总体来说，我还是比较喜欢这个酒店的风格的，高速下来，要穿过富春江二桥和另外一个桥，到达城市的最北面。酒店的位置非常难找，我找了很多人问，一共花了45分钟才找到酒店，最后发现跟我一样的好像还不只一个！上海上服不知道是个什么东东，在那里搞了个什么连锁酒店。酒店比较旧，感觉历史不短，但是应该开张时间不太长，不知道怎么回事。说是山庄，好像也没什么游乐设施，晚上很安静，可以听到很细微的声音，车子开进来，有专人帮你指挥停在指定的地方。当然，人家停车的声音你在房间里也可以听得一清二楚！就象前面点评得一样，楼下总台的服务员mm态度很好，很淳朴，回答了我得很多问题，为我第二天的行程提了很多意见，还是很具有参考意义的。,"Tonglu is a small county. It takes 20 minutes to drive from south to north.In general, I still prefer the style of this hotel. When you come down at a high speed, you have to pass through the Fuchunjiang Second Bridge and another bridge to reach the north of the city.The location of the hotel was very difficult to find. I found a lot of people and asked for a total of 45 minutes to find the hotel. Finally, I found that there seemed to be more than one as me!I do n’t know what Dongdong is in Shanghai.The hotel is relatively old, and it feels that history is not short, but it should not be too long, and I don't know what's going on.It seems that it is a villa, and there seems to be no amusement facilities. It is very quiet at night. You can hear a very subtle voice. The car is drove in. Some people will help you to direct in the designated place.Of course, you can also hear the sound of parking in the room!Just like the comments earlier, MM, the waiter downstairs, has a good attitude, very simple, answered many questions I have, and I have made a lot of opinions for my next day's itinerary. It is still very reference."
0,"这样的酒店一般,前台服务员善意提醒预定房间有些吵(靠近高架),因为只有这样的房间才有收费的宽带,查看房间后感觉还可以,可服务员就不能等待10min再下楼登记,而是要求必须马上登记,好像担心我们会偷他们的东西似的.","Such a hotel is generally reminded by the front desk waiter to remind the booking room a little noisy (close to the elevated), because only such a room has a broadband for charging. After viewing the room, it feels okay.It must be registered immediately, as if worried that we will steal their things."
0,酒店比较一般，隔音不是很好，比较令人不满的是早餐，口味及品种皆不理想，希望能够改进。,The hotel is relatively average. The sound insulation is not very good. What is more dissatisfied is breakfast. The taste and variety are not ideal. I hope it can be improved.
0,入住的5天，天天洗桑拿一样，空调效果极其不好，每天都有顾客打电话质问服务员，我在房内经常听到其他顾客的抱怨，要不是离出差地方近，我是不会选择这家酒店的，服务员对自己酒店设施不清楚，我打电话问有没有冰箱，第一次说有，第二次说没有。投诉在不会处理！希望大家有前车之鉴，不要上当，在住这家酒店了！宾馆反馈2008年7月7日：尊敬的客人您好！首先，感谢您给我们酒店提出的宝贵意见，同时也对您住店期间感受到的不适深表歉意。三峡东山酒店是一家三星级酒店，2007年被宜昌市旅游局评选为绿色饭店（银叶级）。作为一家以节能、环保为理念进行经营的饭店，酒店一直将节能、环保视为一项对社会应尽的责任。多年来，酒店时刻响应国家环保要求，严格按照：夏季室内温度不低于25度，冬季室内温度不高于20度来控制客房内温度，因为酒店事先在客房内配备了环保倡导卡，自活动开展以来，这一举措得到了大部分住店宾客的理解和支持。但是，由于个体差异，有部分宾客对空调温度的需求相差较大，从而也造成了酒店在节能与对客服务方面会产生矛盾。酒店在今后的工作中将会把准备工作做得更为仔细，在倡导客人支持酒店的环保行动的同时，将尽量满足不同客人的需求，不断改进我们的服务。,"For the 5 days to stay in, the air conditioner was extremely bad, like the sauna every day. Every day, customers called the waiter. I often hear other customers' complaints in the room. If it was not close to the place, I would never choose thisIn the hotel, the waiter was unclear about my hotel's facilities. I called and asked if there was a refrigerator. The first time I said, and the second time I said no.The complaint is not handled!I hope everyone has a lesson in front of the car. Don't be fooled, live in this hotel!Hotel feedback on July 7, 2008: Dear guests!First of all, thank you for your valuable opinions on the hotel, and also apologize to the discomfort you feel during your stay.The three -star hotel of the Three Gorges Dongshan Hotel was selected as a green hotel (silver leaf level) by Yichang Tourism Bureau in 2007.As a restaurant operating with the concept of energy conservation and environmental protection, the hotel has always regarded energy conservation and environmental protection as a responsibility for society.Over the years, the hotel has responded to the national environmental requirements at all times. In strict accordance with: the indoor temperature in the summer is not less than 25 degrees, and the indoor temperature in winter is not higher than 20 degrees to control the temperature in the room, because the hotel has equipped environmental protection advocacy cards in the guest room in advance.Since its launch, this move has been understood and supported by most of the guests.However, due to individual differences, some guests have a large demand for air conditioning temperature, which also causes the hotel to conflict with energy conservation and customer service.The hotel will make the preparation more carefully in the future work. While advocating the environmental protection actions of the guests to support the hotel, it will try to meet the needs of different guests and continue to improve our services."
1,优点：位置极佳，服务很好，尤其专设了一名电梯操作员，很好！早餐品种、口味都不错。部分房间有电脑，非常方便！缺点：1、因临近马路，房间有些嘈杂（应该可以解决的）2、出租车进出非常不便（建议底下停车出来后解放路那个活动封闭口打开就可以解决了）3、早餐厅的确存在着客人还在吃，就有服务员过来收拾东西的特点，不舒服。4、接待大厅应该放一些介绍镇江旅游和风土人情的宣传材料。宾馆反馈2008年5月9日：尊敬的宾客：您好！感谢您选择入住我店并提出宝贵意见！我店现已对解放路出口处的活动封闭口按时开启，并规定了车辆进出的指定路线，安排保安负责指引，有效地改善了车辆进出不便这一问题；关于您提到的早餐收台问题，现已对服务员加强培训，要求规范操作流程，同时加强主动服务意识，为客人提供更舒心、更满意的服务。此外为了让更多的外地宾客了解镇江的风土人情，我店已与旅游局联系宣传资料一事。再次感谢您提出的宝贵意见！真心地希望您能一如既往地支持我店！,"Advantages: excellent location and good service, especially a elevator operator, very good!Breakfast varieties and taste are good.There are computers in some rooms, which is very convenient!Disadvantages: 1. Because the road is near the road, the room is a bit noisy (it should be solved) 2. It is very inconvenient to enter and exit taxis (it is recommended to stop the liberation road after the opening of the liberation road can be solved) 3. The breakfast room does have guests.Still eating, some waiters come to clean up things, uncomfortable.4. The reception hall should put some promotional materials that introduce Zhenjiang tourism and customs.Hotel feedback on May 9, 2008: Dear guest: Hello!Thank you for choosing to stay in our store and put forward valuable comments!Our store has now opened on time on the closed mouth of the liberation road exit, and stipulates the designated route of the vehicle in and out. The security guard is responsible for the guidance and effectively improves the problem of inconvenience in the vehicle.Now, we have strengthened the training of the waiters, requiring the standardized operation process, and at the same time strengthen the awareness of active service to provide customers with more comfortable and satisfactory services.In addition, in order to allow more foreign guests to understand the customs of Zhenjiang, our store has contacted the publicity information with the Tourism Bureau.Thank you again for your precious opinions!I sincerely hope that you can support our store as always!"
1,彭年酒店太处于闹市停车不方便，房间有异味，尤其脱离希尔顿后感觉差很多。,"Pengnian Hotel is too inconvenient to park in the downtown. The room has a odor, especially after leaving Hilton."
1,房间比较干净舒适！松江商务型酒店比较少！这家酒店还可以！,The room is relatively clean and comfortable!Songjiang Business Hotel is relatively small!This hotel is okay!
0,酒店地方很偏，在一个远离市区的开发区，环境冷清。前台服务很差。我办理入住的时候，两个接待小姐都在忙。但一个忙完了后看到我站在台前也不知道主动招呼，而是去相帮另一个。后面一个客人进来直接挤到我旁边，大声吆喝要办入住，那小姐立刻去帮他办理了。训示她怎么不懂让客人排队，居然没有反应。酒店中餐厅在另一幢楼，那天都被包了做婚宴，只能外出找吃饭的地方。,"The hotel's place is very biased. In a development zone far from the urban area, the environment is deserted.The front desk service is poor.When I was in hand in, both receiving ladies were busy.But after I was busy, I saw that I stood in front of the stage and didn't know how to greet them, but went to help another.A guest behind came in and squeezed directly beside me, and he sighed loudly and had to do it. The lady immediately went to help him to handle it.The training shows why she doesn't know to let the guests line up, but there is no response.The restaurant in the hotel was in another building. On that day, he was wrapped in a wedding banquet and could only go out to find a place to eat."
0,酒店的位置还比较方便，但是过于嘈杂，酒店的设施也太陈旧，大床和标准床无太大区别。,"The location of the hotel is relatively convenient, but it is too noisy, and the hotel's facilities are too old. The big bed and the standard bed are not much different."
0,介绍说酒店是座落于北四环的北苑路，结果晕我。该酒店位置偏僻，再走几步就是五环了，怎么会是四环？？第二天一早等半天也没有出租车来，只有走到大马路边去等，还是没有。冷得要命，最后没有办法，有一黑出租问我走不走，只有坐上车走了。房间还是不错得。,"The hotel is the Beiyuan Road, which is located in the North Fourth Ring Road, and fainted me.The hotel is remote. A few more steps are the five rings. How can it be the four rings?IntersectionI did n’t have a taxi for a half day the next morning. I only went to the side of Malaysia to wait.I was so cold, but in the end there was no way. I had a black rental and asked me if I could n’t go.The room is still good."
0,缺点：1，小酒店，估计只租了几层做酒店用。2，房间很吵，靠马路那边的。3，服务不怎么样。,"Disadvantages: 1. Small hotels, it is estimated that only a few floors are used for hotels.2. The room is noisy, relying on the road.3. The service is not good."
1,宾馆采用地热取暖感觉很舒服，整个酒店很暖和，前台服务周到，态度很好，早餐自助方式，还不错，我住的是商务间，淋浴房由于没有门，水会出来，是设计的问题，另外，房间的灯太暗了，其实换瓦数大一点的灯泡就可以了。,"The hotel uses geothermal warming and feels very comfortable. The entire hotel is very warm, the front desk is thoughtful, and the attitude is very good. The breakfast self -help method is not bad. I live in a business room. Because the shower room does not have a door, the water will come out. It is a design problem.In addition, the lights in the room are too dark, in fact, the large light bulb is enough."
1,"这次是我第二次入住青年会了,主要是服务态度好,房间环境好,周围的交通比较方便..这次酒店给我们安排到新装修的房间,各个设施以及环境更加齐全更好.下次还是会选择青年会.","This time, my second time to stay in the youth meeting, mainly because of the good service attitude, good room environment, and convenient transportation .. This time the hotel arranged us to the newly renovated room. Each facilities and the environment are more complete and better.I will choose the Youth Club next time."
1,酒店的服务很热情，对于我们的客房要求总能及时回应。地理位置不错，离中山北街很近，吃饭方便。,"The service of the hotel is very enthusiastic, and we can always respond to our room requirements.The geographical location is good, it is very close to Zhongshan North Street, and it is convenient to eat."
1,房间和床太小，睡着不是很舒服，希望以后呢能够给大一点的，总之希望改进．,"The room and the bed are too small, and it is not very comfortable to fall asleep. I hope that in the future, I can give it a little bigger. In short, I hope to improve."
1,这次没有定行政间，想看看普通大床和行政房的区别。发现房间还是不错的。床很大。服务态度还不错，门口换了女门童，笑容不错。前台接待和礼宾部的服务也不错。,"There is no administrative room this time. I want to see the difference between ordinary large beds and administrative houses.I found that the room is still good.The bed is large.The service attitude is not bad. The girl's door was changed at the door, and she smiled well.The front desk reception and the service of the Libin department are also good."
1,香格里拉３天游，住在这里，可能期望值较低，住后感觉很不错，在这样的地方来说，服务设施环境都可以算一流，藏式标间很有异域风情，可以床好硬，睡的不舒服艾，晚上很冷，要盖两条被子．早餐还算丰盛，不过没有牛奶，奶粉冲的．,"Shangri -La travels for 3 days and lives here. It may have a low expectation value. After living, it feels very good. In such a place, the service facility environment can be considered first -class. The Tibetan standard room is very exotic.Uncomfortable, it's cold at night, cover two quilts.Breakfast is quite rich, but there is no milk, milk powder is flushed."
1,"虽然外观不是很显眼,不过内部的房间不错,服务也挺好的:)","Although the appearance is not very conspicuous, the internal room is good and the service is good :)"
1,此酒店比较小气，热水和空调有时间限制，就连酒店大厅也是如此，在旅行空闲时享受不到舒适的环境，每次回宾馆后都要进行很多次交涉，对于此事很是失望；不过值得表扬的是，服务态度相当不错，称得上五级水准。,"This hotel is relatively stingy, and the hot water and air conditioner have time limit, even the hotel lobby is the same. When traveling freely, you ca n’t enjoy a comfortable environment. After returning to the hotel, you have to negotiate many times.It is worthy of praise that the service attitude is quite good, which is called level 5."
0,环境非常恶劣，没有空调，房间昏暗潮湿。保证以后再也不去住了！！！,"The environment is very bad, there is no air conditioner, and the room is dim and humid.Guaranteed to stay again in the future!IntersectionIntersection"
1,地点较好，周围有餐馆、超市等设施，适合出长差住宿。房间和价格基本能接受。我的要求是能睡好，安全就好，它可以达到。后来比较了类似的酒店，价钱贵了点。,"The location is good, there are restaurants, supermarkets and other facilities around, suitable for long -distance accommodation.The room and price are basically acceptable.My requirement is to sleep well, just be safe, it can meet.Later, a similar hotel was compared, and the price was a bit expensive."

1,酒店有点旧，但是房间本身很干净。服务很好。早餐30元，东西还是挺多的，值得去吃。相对来说，酒店一楼餐厅80多元的晚饭就一般了一点。不好吃也不难吃，就那么回事情。,"The hotel is a bit old, but the room itself is very clean.The service was excellent.30 yuan for breakfast, there are still a lot of things, it is worth eating.Relatively speaking, more than 80 dinner on the first floor of the hotel is a bit average.It's not delicious, it's not difficult to eat, just like that."
0,如果你是用携程订的，他们会告诉你不要给携程讲住过酒店。这个酒店就是便宜，便宜无好货也是有道理的。下次不会去住了宾馆反馈2008年5月12日：您好，我是如家七斗星沙坪坝店店助，非常抱歉给您留下如此不好的印象，我为您受到的如此遭遇给您真诚的道歉。因为我店前期正在进行人员调整，前台服务员都是新招的员工，由于我们对他们的培训不够，以至于服务员在工作中的服务很不到位，确实犯了很多错误，经过这一个月的严格培训，现在酒店的服务水平已有大幅提升，各种工作已有很大进步，非常欢迎您再次入住我们酒店，相信这次肯定会留下美好的印象，真诚的邀请您。最后再谢谢您给我们提出意见，没有您这样的客人，我们的服务将不能提高，非常感谢。,"If you order Ctrip, they will tell you not to give Ctrip to the hotel.This hotel is cheap, cheap and good goods also make sense.I will not stay in the hotel next time to feedback on May 12, 2008: Hello, I am a home for the Qidou Xingxing Shapingba Store, I am very sorry to leave such a bad impression on you.You sincerely apologize.Because the staff is being adjusted in the early stage, the front desk waiters are newly recruited employees. Because we have not trained enough training, the waiter's service at work is not in place.Training, the service level of the hotel has been greatly improved, and various tasks have made great progress. You are very welcome to stay in our hotel again. I believe that this time will definitely leave a wonderful impression and sincerely invite you.Finally, thank you for your opinion. Without you, our service will not be improved without you. Thank you very much."
1,忍不住说两句，这里的性价比的确很高，院内幽静、安全，走廊也十分安静，透着私密性，房间中配备吹风机、小闹钟、台历，还有免费咖啡、矿泉水以及擦鞋服务，感觉很贴心。我住的是古典大床间，但床不是很大，“古典”不知体现在何处，另外周边200米内似乎没有早点铺，或许因为春节期间全关门了。,"I can't help but say a few words. The cost performance here is indeed very high. The courtyard is quiet and safe, and the corridor is very quiet. It is private. The room is equipped with a hair dryer, a small alarm clock, a desk calendar, and free coffee, mineral water and shoe shoe service services.It feels very intimate.I live in the classical large bed, but the bed is not very large. The ""classical"" does not know where it is reflected. In addition, there seems to be no early shop within 200 meters around. Perhaps it is closed during the Spring Festival."

0,"我以携程名义预定如家快捷酒店,从2008年4月8号入住到15号退房共住了一星期,一日151元的房价是不贵,但是15号我大约中午12:25左右办理结帐退房,如家快捷酒店却说我没有在中午12点整之前结帐,因超过如家快捷酒店规定的时间,所以要加收半日的房费76元,当时我愣了一下,并跟店家力争说明,为何入住时怎么不向我说明清楚规定?再来我是订房至15号,为何15号中午12点之前不能用电话提前通知我退房时间?如果我超时30分钟必须要加收房费,按照比例原则如家却要收半日的房费也太离谱了！他们解释说:因为我是透过携程仲介订房,所以公司规定就是如此,他们也无法改变,如果是如家的会员订房有一小时的弹性时间。听见如家酒店的解释,我是深感如家酒店根本不注重消费者的权益,只注重他们自己的利益,就因我是在网上透过携程仲介订房,更让人有变相加价的感觉,再来如家酒店对自己的会员和对其他合作单位订房的会员权益有这么大的差异呢?四星或五星酒店也没有这么收费法吧?","I booked Rujia Express Hotel in the name of Ctrip.

The house price of 151 yuan a day was not expensive, but I was handled at about 12:25 noon on the 15th.After checking out the account, Rujia Express Hotel said that I did not check out before 12 noon. Because it exceeded the time prescribed by the Rujia Express Hotel, I had to charge a half -day room fee of 76 yuan. At that timeWhy don't you explain to me clearly when you enter? I will reservation until the 15th, why can't I notify me in advance before 12 noon on the 15th?The proportion principle is too outrageous to charge half a day!They explained: Because I reservations through Ctrip agencies, the company's regulations are so, and they cannot change. If a member of Rujia's family booking, there is an hour of elasticity.After hearing the explanation of Rujia Hotel, I feel that I do n’t pay attention to consumers' rights and interests at all. I only pay attention to their own interests. Because I book a house through the network through the Internet, it makes people feel more disguised.Is there such a big difference in the hotel's rights and interests to the membership of their members and other cooperative units? There is no such charge method for four -star or five -star hotels, right?"
1,标准三星水平，地毯不错，只是距离外滩的距离比较远。,"Standard Samsung level, the carpet is good, but the distance is far from the Bund."
1,"因为是蜜月旅行,所以酒店免费将园景房升级到5层的超级海景房，可以看到美丽的维多利亚湾，而且还有一瓶好酒相送。房间很干净，也很大，酒店服务也不错。虽然酒店不在市中心，但酒店的班车很方便，每半个小时一般往返尖沙嘴。其实，从酒店出去，就有sasa和bodyshop，也有一个购物中心，到达的第一天，就可以进行简单购物了。","Because it is a honeymoon travel, the hotel will upgrade the garden view room to the 5 -story super -view room for free.

1,环境比较不错，做为柳州本地升级上来的四星酒店来说，还是比较不错的！并且服务员的态度也是非常好的，在房间中拨打国内长途免费，这是只有柳州地区才有的！较为有特色！,"The environment is relatively good.

1,经携程定的浪漫情人夜度假产品，6月20日中午12点入住蜜月套房，中午12点30分到达酒店、办理好入住手续才被告知房间未搞卫生，需要一小时、问前台接待是否留电话给他，搞好卫生通知一声，得到冷淡的回答：一小时后自已来问吧！没办法只好在西餐厅苦苦的等待，等到1点30分到前台询问：另外一位接待的感到奇怪怎还没能给入住，打电话问后答复还需要20分钟才能搞好，1点50分终于可以入住了。进入房间感到有点热就打开空调、调到22度，冲个凉休息一下，睡了一会感到房间还是那么热，一看空调、调节器定的22度显示屋内温度28度，打电话到管家部、答应叫工程师过来看看，等了10分钟工程师来了，说了一句：不好意思，我们是中央空调，现在全部设定的温度是27-28度，晚上就会好点，真难受！这就是五星级酒店，晚上上半夜的温度是25度、早上8点钟再看是24度，大家想象一下，6月20日是《夏至》是全年最热的日子，住在这样的五星级宾馆是不是拿钱来受罪啊！酒店大堂是豪华，西餐厅的套餐是不错，可是前台的接待和酒店为了省电所设定的温度真的太差劲了，原定第二天入住豪华客房，也只能取消赳快离开了…,"The romantic lover night vacation product of Cai Ying, stayed at the honeymoon suite at 12 noon on June 20, arrived at the hotel at 12:30 noon, and went through the check -in procedure before being told that the room was not hygienic.Give him the phone, make a good notice, and get a cold answer: Let's ask yourself one hour later!There was no way to wait in the western restaurant.

1,很好的一个酒店。比路桥的南苑e家性价比要高的多。早餐非常丰富！超值！座便居然是带清洗的，我住过的酒店这是独一份！出门正赶上下雨，向前台借了一把伞，居然不要任何担保，这份信任让人感动！椒江、路桥、黄岩地区我肯定是作为首选了。补充点评2007年12月20日：光表扬，忘记批评了！酒店的空调不制热，问了前台，结果到我退房也没给我结果。还有个好消息，酒店换床了！据说被子也要换。那就更完美了！,"A good hotel.It is much higher than the Nanyuan E of Luqiao.Breakfast is very rich!Value!The seats are actually cleaned.

0,第一次接触速8酒店，感觉比较失望。相比以往接触过的如家、7days、锦江之星等连锁经济酒店，感觉速8无论从硬件到软件都还很有差距。房间小得出乎想象，设施也比较陈旧。服务人员的态度尚算和善，但还是比较呆板僵硬，丝毫没有体现出全球连锁酒店员工的职业素养。,"For the first time to contact the speed 8 hotel, it felt disappointed.Compared with the chain economic hotels such as such as home, 7DAYS, and Jinjiang Star in the past, there is still a gap between speed 8 from hardware to software.The room is too small, and the facilities are relatively old.The attitude of the service staff is still good, but it is still rigid and rigid. It does not reflect the professional literacy of the global chain hotel employees."
1,酒店交通方便，环境也不错，正好是我们办事地点的旁边，感觉性价比还可以，以后还会考虑入住该酒店。,"The hotel is convenient and the environment is good. It happens to be next to our place of service. It feels that it is okay to be cost -effective. In the future, you will consider staying in the hotel."
0,说句实话，我没有想到这次携程太叫我失望了，我一直都很相信你们，可能是你们企业现在做大了，对我们这些一直都默默支持你们的客户开始疏忽了，但是对一个以服务性质为龙头的企业来说。你们已经渐渐的丢弃的不仅仅是一群客户而是你们企业的文化和企业的精神，如果这样下去对一个像你们这样以服务才能取得市场经济优势的企业；在市场经济竞争这么激烈的情况，这样生存下去都将是一个致命伤啊，重视。我最后一天住的是你们推荐的景德镇开门子大酒店，是我所住全国挂牌最差的四星级酒店，不仅仅是他的硬件设施和服务都无法恭维，我简直是无言，临走我给他们酒店留了言，这样的价格，这样的服务怎么还能挂牌4星，当地的旅游局是怎么去复查他们的级别的，你们携程太不负责任了，怎么可以把这样一个酒店随便就推荐给客人，房间的地毯有水，整个房间的周边地毯全部是白色的粉末，卫生间的设施还不如我们在婺源住的一个200的自己找的一个酒店的设施，不经意的都可以看到很多剥落的墙纸，去游泳还要换上他们的桑拿服，其实一楼就可以直接进去，问过才知道桑拿是承包出去了，晕！！！客房要他们送几个一次性拖鞋说要另外收费，天，我这是第一次在一个四星级酒店第一次听到这样的收费项目，交涉以后没有收，不说了，大家不信就去试一次吧！！！唯一觉得欣慰的是酒店大堂的服务够3星标准。携程啊携程，你们要重视啊！,"To be honest, I did not expect that this time Ctrip told me to be disappointed. I have always believed in you. Maybe your company has become bigger now. The customers who have always supported you have been negligent.For enterprises with a leading service.You have gradually discarded not just a group of customers but the culture of your enterprise and the spirit of your enterprise.Survive will be a fatal injury, pay attention to.The last day I lived in the Gate of Jingdezhen opened the Gate Hotel you recommended. It is the worst four -star hotel in the country where I live in. Not only his hardware facilities and services cannot be complimented, I am speechless.I left their hotels, how can such a price be listed in 4 stars, how can the local tourism bureau review their level, and you Ctrip is too irresponsible. How can you just take such a hotel casually?It is recommended to the guests. The carpet in the room is water. The surrounding carpets of the entire room are all white powder. The facilities of the bathroom are not as good as the facilities of a hotel we found in a 200 ourselves in Wuyuan.The peeling wallpaper, go swimming and put on their sauna. In fact, you can go directly on the first floor. After asking, you know that the sauna is contracted, dizzy!IntersectionIntersectionThe rooms asked them to send a few disposable slippers to say that they need to charge another fee.Try it once!IntersectionIntersectionThe only thing that I feel gratified is that the service of the hotel lobby is enough for 3 -star standard.Ctrip, Ctrip, you must pay attention to it!"
1,12月7日入住3号楼豪华标间。酒店规模挺大，也比较气派。房间还不错，干净卫生，配套也算齐全，只是没有配盒式纸巾，印象中四星以上的酒店都有的。物有所值，推荐。,"Check in the luxury room No. 3 on December 7.The hotel is quite large and more elegant.The room is not bad, clean and hygienic, and the supporting facilities are complete, but there are no box -type paper towels. There are hotels above four stars.It is worthwhile, recommended."
1,性价比高的酒店，距离地铁近，邻华师大，环境好。,"The cost -effective hotel is close to the subway, the neighboring China Normal University, and the environment is good."
0,10月5号到6号，只住一天，中午12点左右到的宾馆，竟然房间还没有收拾，屋里一股臭味，酒店理由是人员不够，收拾不过来~~无语！2点才弄好，建议大家选择别的酒店，顺便说一句，一次性拖鞋10元一双还有酒店出门边上好像是BTV的餐厅，自助30一位，绝对超值，单点就不用了，又贵量又少。,"From October 5th to 6th, just stayed in the hotel at about 12 noon. The room had not yet packed up. There was a smell in the room. The reason for the hotel was not enough personnel to clean up ~~ Speechless!It is not ready at 2 o'clock. It is recommended that you choose another hotel. By the way, a one -time slippers are 10 yuan a pair and the hotel is a restaurant on the side of the hotel. It seems to be a buffet 30.It's expensive and less."
1,房间设施和卫生还可以，但不幸的是酒店2楼还是3楼是歌厅，即使在6楼，夜里也可闻歌舞声，另外就是晚上有骚扰电话。,"The room facilities and hygiene are okay, but unfortunately, the second floor of the hotel is a singing hall. Even on the 6th floor, there can be song and dancing at night. In addition, there are harassment calls at night."
0,简单的说:1、酒店设施确如携程所说，是新装修的，可以说是嘉峪关市比较好的酒店，位置也很好，在市中心；2、服务太差。一是所有房间都上不了网，这和携程网上的说明不一致；二是因为房间全部是东西向的，我们住西边的房间，虽然是六月份，但到晚上依然很热。就要求服务员开空调，结果服务员先说空调在维修，我们因为实在热的不行，就提出要退房。结果他们又说空调好了。结果开了不到2小时，我们又被热醒了，原来服务员又把空调关了。而且，由于空调主机就放在楼顶，一开空调，顶层的噪声也特别大，折腾了我们一夜没睡好，第二天我们就赶紧退房搬到了对面的一家商务酒店，价格差不多，很不错。强烈建议其他旅友要注意,"Simply put: 1. The hotel facilities are indeed as new decoration as Ctrip said. It can be said that it is a better hotel in Jiayuguan City. The location is also very good, in the city center; 2. The service is too poor.One is that all rooms cannot be available on the Internet, which is inconsistent with the explanation of Ctrip.Ask the waiter to turn on the air conditioner. As a result, the waiter first said that the air conditioner was repairing. We proposed to check out because it was really hot.As a result, they said that the air conditioner was better.As a result, less than 2 hours, we were awakened again, and the waiter turned off the air conditioner again.Moreover, because the air conditioner host is placed on the top of the building. As soon as the air conditioner is turned on, the noise on the top floor is also particularly large. We tossed that we did not sleep well overnight. The next day we hurriedly check out a business hotel on the opposite side.good.It is strongly recommended to pay attention to other travelers"
1,喜欢~下次还去~,I like it ~ I will go next time ~
1,该酒店的环境真的很不错，贵宾楼的房间挺舒服，宾馆的服务也挺好的，坐车好像不是很困难，要出租车时打个电话给服务台，很快就叫到车了．下次到黄石还想住这个酒店！,"The environment of the hotel is really good. The room of the VIP building is very comfortable, and the hotel's service is also very good. It seems that it is not difficult to take a car. When you want to taxi, call the service desk and soon call it.Next time I arrived in Huangshi, I still want to stay in this hotel!"
1,住过很多次了，房间很大，性价比比较高。缺点是对常客的习惯没有档案不能提供更体贴的服务。房间地毯的清洁差一些。电视的可选台太少了，应该可以在房间准备一份楼下澳葡街的菜牌，这样对客人更方便，也可以成为酒店的卖点。其他方面比较满意。,"I have lived many times, the room is very large, and the cost performance is relatively high.The disadvantage is that there is no more considerate service for the habit of frequent customers.The cleaning of the room carpet is worse.There are too few optional tables on TV. You should prepare a table of menu and Portuguese Street in the room. This is more convenient for guests and can also become the selling point of the hotel.Other aspects are more satisfied."
1,酒店也推出套票，内容与携程相同。携程套票价格并无优势，但增加了豪华房套票的选择。由于用了抵用券，携程豪华房与酒店高级房套票价格一样。SPA房环境不错，有泰式风情。套票仅含背部按摩，手法不错但时间短。四肢按摩需要加钱（88元/人），且不含头部、胸部，要按得再加钱。沐足中心提供沐足+推拿的套票，98元/人/3小时，比SPA超值许多。酒店游乐项目丰富，观光电梯不错，人工沙滩有特色，仙湖很大且风景很了，踩脚踏船一个小时都不能走个来回。酒店服务尚可，服务人员有礼貌。房间很失望，即使是豪华房也极普通，就三星水准。房间隔音不佳。西餐厅不大但早餐丰富、中餐厅祈福轩味道佳分量足还不贵，渔人码头一般。沿湖向外走出有家仙湖半岛食肆，如果早到还可坐在湖边位置，边吃饭边赏湖景，很惬意。推荐咸鸡、虎皮青椒焖豆角、椒盐骨！总之，托酒店和携程的福，三天两晚端午假期过的较尽兴，玩法丰富不枯燥，还吃到酒店送的粽子。PS.酒店一至三楼的楼梯有点绕，要有耐心，哈哈！补充点评2008年6月10日：酒店玩法较丰富，水上活动、康体设施及摆摊游戏都很多。我和先生二人三天两晚的端午假期，总花费应不足二千元，以这个价钱来说，是个不错的短期悠闲度假的选择！,"The hotel also launched a package, the content is the same as Ctrip.The price of Ctrip tickets has no advantage, but it has increased the choice of luxury house tickets.Due to the use of coupons, Ctrip luxury houses are the same as the hotel's high -end house ticket price.The SPA room has a good environment and has a Thai style.The package contains only back massage, with good techniques but short time.Limb massage needs to add money (88 yuan/person), and does not contain heads and chests. Press and add money.The Mu Foot Center provides a package of foot+massage, 98 yuan/person/3 hours, which is much more value than SPA.The hotel's amusement project is rich, the sightseeing elevator is good, the artificial beach is unique, the fairy lake is very large and the scenery is very very beautiful.The hotel service is acceptable, and the service staff is polite.The room was disappointed. Even luxury rooms were extremely ordinary, just Samsung.The room sound insulation is not good.Western restaurants are not large, but they are rich in breakfast, and the Chinese restaurant has a good taste.Walking out of a fairy lake peninsula restaurant along the lake. If you can still sit by the lake early, you can sit and enjoy the lake view while eating.Recommended salted chicken, tiger pepper green pepper bean horns, salt and pepper bone!In short, the blessings of the hotel and Ctrip have been happy during the Dragon Boat Festival for three days and two nights. The gameplay is rich and not boring.PS. The stairs on the first to third floor of the hotel are a bit around, be patient, haha!Supplementary comment on June 10, 2008: The hotel has rich gameplay, and there are many games, the waterfall facilities, and the stall games.My husband and I have a total cost of less than 2,000 yuan for three days and two nights. The total cost should be less than 2,000 yuan. In this price, it is a good short -term leisure vacation choice!"
1,非常不错的酒店，房间虽然不大但很精致，落地玻璃墙感觉视线宽阔。酒店服务也很到位，客房服务也很周到。购物、出游交通极为方便。下次去还会选择该酒店。,"Very good hotel, although the room is not large but exquisite, the floor -to -ceiling wall feels wide.Hotel services are also in place, and guest room services are also very thoughtful.Shopping and travel transportation is extremely convenient.Next time you go, you will choose the hotel."

0,"酒店开业较早,硬件设施老化严重,1天之内在楼层中没有找到服务员","The hotel opened earlier, and the hardware facilities were seriously aging. No waiter was found in the floor within 1 day."
1,房间还是比较大的。也比较整洁。这在亳州应该是很好的。跟其他内地宾馆一样，我觉得服务有待提高。打电话问总机开车到他们宾馆怎么走，他们直接告诉我们不知道。晚上8点多在2楼餐厅吃饭，点菜的小姐不是很耐烦，有些菜都没在菜单上，上菜的速度也不快。不过，感觉菜的味道还不错。,"The room is still relatively large.It is also clean.This should be very good in Bozhou.Like other mainland hotels, I think the service needs to be improved.They called and asked how to drive to their hotel, they directly told us not to know.Eat at the restaurant on the second floor at more than 8 pm. The lady who ordered the food was not very impatient. Some dishes were not on the menu, and the speed of serving was not fast.However, the taste of dishes is not bad."
1,这次预定的是468元的房间（无窗），房间的灯光不够亮，（有好几个灯是坏的）。所以很不习惯。尤其是早上觉得太暗了。建议要预定如入住此酒店，要提前预订。因为酒店每层只有一间带窗（468元）。或可预定前面1号楼的房间。,"This time it is a room of 468 yuan (no window). The lights in the room are not bright enough (several lights are bad).So I am not used to it.Especially in the morning, I felt too dark.It is recommended to book in this hotel, and book reservations in advance.Because the hotel has only one window (468 yuan) on each floor.Or you can book a room in the first 1 building."
1,"帮朋友订过,大家反映还不错,住宿条件满好的.房价不贵,早餐品种还算丰富,中午自助相当便宜,建议有机会可以去尝尝.下次还是会住的.","If you have booked it for your friends, everyone reports that it is not bad. The accommodation conditions are good. House prices are not expensive, and the breakfast varieties are rich. Self -service at noon is quite cheap. It is recommended to have the opportunity to try it. Next time, you will still live."
1,环境优雅，但蚊子剧多，光被我打死的就有二三十支，漏网者中尚有吞舟之鱼。酒店有接机服务，但所派来的司机向我推荐次日包车一日游，只需150块。然次日方知，此纯为一圈套也，耽误我诸多时间，可气。另外，早餐极差，牛奶是用奶粉冲的，而且连奶粉都舍不得放，稀得跟刷锅水似的。,"The environment is elegant, but there are many mosquitoes. There are twenty or thirty beaten by me.The hotel has a pick -up service, but the driver sent to me recommends charter a day trip to me the next day, only 150 yuan.However, the next day knows that this is purely a circle, which delays me a lot of time and can be angry.In addition, breakfast is extremely poor, milk is rushed with milk powder, and even milk powder is reluctant to put it, it is as scarce as brushing water."
1,"还可以,不过第一次入住的时候没有送水果,这次送了,不过第二天把我第一天存的水果换了,虽然房务中心帮我换了两个苹果,不过一个坏的,不过总体还可以,听说马上要涨价了,因为听说评上了四星级,哎","It's okay, but I did not give the fruit when I stayed for the first time., But overall, I heard that the price is about to increase, because I heard that the four -star level has been reviewed, hey"
0,感觉不好，房间太旧而房价太贵，早餐也很差！,"It doesn't feel good, the room is too old, the house price is too expensive, and the breakfast is poor!"
1,"酒店整体环境感觉不错,服务态度好,除了卧室太小,房间内的两个床挨得太近,几乎可以滚到一块外,整体感觉都不错.","The overall environment of the hotel feels good and the service attitude is good. Except that the bedroom is too small, the two beds in the room are too close, and they can almost roll over a piece. The overall feeling is good."
1,房间格局非常好，让人有家的感觉，很舒适，服务也很到位，只是可能面对的消费群以外企人员（听服务生说外国人外国人）居多，饭店餐饮的准备方面较单调。隔音也不错，只是床似乎质量差了些，翻个身就会有吱吱呀呀的声音，这个让我睡得不是很舒服。另外有点遗憾的是，入住当天，工程部的来装卫星电视，确定对方装完后，我就挂上请勿打扰的牌，准备休息，可没几分钟，刚上床，门铃又响起了，这让我有些郁闷，请勿打扰似乎不该是摆设。其他都非常好，下次应该还会选择入住。,"The room pattern is very good, it feels like home, comfortable, and service is in place. It is only that the consumer groups may face foreign enterprises (listening to waiters and foreigners foreigners), and the preparation of restaurants and drinks is relatively monotonous.The sound insulation is also good, but the bed seems to be worse, and there will be a squeaking sound when I turn it over. This makes me sleep very comfortably.Another regret is that on the day of check -in, the engineering department came to install satellite TV. After confirming that the other party was installed, I would hang on the cards that do not disturb.Make me a little depressed, do not disturb if it doesn't seem to be a furnishings.The others are very good, and you should choose to stay next time."
0,设施老化，紧靠马路噪音太大。晚上楼上卫生间的水流声和空调噪音非常大，无法入眠，跟总台反映后，服务员姗姗来迟，强调就是如此。建议入住开发区安庆大酒店和市区人民路的锦江之星,"The facilities are aging and the road is close to the road.In the evening, the water flow and air -conditioning noise in the bathroom were very noisy and could not fall asleep. After the reflection of the head station, the waiter was late, emphasizing that this was the case.It is recommended to stay at the Star of Jinjiang, Anqing Hotel in the Development Zone and the People's Road in the city"
1,有点吵，晚上吵的我都睡不着觉了，不过酒店环境还算新，,"It's a bit noisy, I can't sleep at night, but the hotel environment is quite new,"
1,我是6月5-6日住的，主楼园景双人房，对酒店非常满意，设施还算新，房间够大，布置也不错，大堂够气派，服务也好，酒店外就是白鹭洲风景区，一出酒店就是湖，非常舒服，而且地段也不错，10元就能到中山路，送的自助早餐不错。如果下次去厦门，我也会再住这里的。,"I lived on June 5-6, and the main building garden scenery is very satisfied with the hotel. The facilities are new, the room is large enough, the layout is good, the lobby is full of style, and the service is good.It is the lake when it is out of the hotel, which is very comfortable, and the location is good. You can get to Zhongshan Road at 10 yuan. The buffet breakfast is good.If you go to Xiamen next time, I will live here again."
0,服务还可以。房间奇差，我住的是商务楼层，味道特浓，空调像大马力鼓风机，只能开窗睡觉，整夜与蚊共舞（我是凌晨入住的）。还要表扬一下，携程的客服，当天不知道为什么，几乎所有南宁的酒店都没有大床房，客服还是很有耐心帮我联系好几家酒店。,"The service is okay.The room was poor. I lived in the business floor. The taste was very strong. The air conditioner was like a Malaysian drum fan. I could only open the window to sleep.Also praise, Ctrip's customer service, I do n’t know why, almost all the hotels in Nanning do n’t have a large bed, and the customer service is still very patient to help me contact several hotels."
1,由于没有标准房，给换了间有约层的房间，感觉还不错，就是早餐差了一点。,"Because there is no standard room, there is a room where there is an appointment. It feels good, but the breakfast is a bit worse."
1,酒店门口时条单行道，外出有些不方便！其他还行,"At the door of the hotel, there is a single way, and it is not convenient to go out!Other other"
1,房间环境还行，还有液晶电脑，晚上还有水果，就是周围购物要走点路，整体还行,"The room environment is okay, and there are LCD computers. At night"
1,地点和位置很好，晚上比较安静，设施较全。对于一般的自助游来说比较合适。,"The location and location are very good, the at night is relatively quiet, and the facilities are relatively complete.It is more appropriate for general self -guided tour."
1,"从现在眼光看一般了,房间舒适度还行,床不错,卫生间算普通的了,关键价格偏高.","From now on the eyes, the comfort of the room is okay, the bed is good, the bathroom is ordinary, and the key price is high."
1,"这次我入住的是该酒店的旧楼,总体感觉还可以,就是装修太旧了.酒店的位置不错,出门过马路就是华强北步行街,逛街方便.我入住的那天酒店生意清淡,可以看出跟深圳同类酒店相比,该酒店已经落伍了.","This time I stayed in the old building of the hotel. The overall feeling is OK, that is, the decoration is too old. The location of the hotel is good. When you go out and cross the road, it is Huaqiangbei Pedestrian Street.Compared with similar hotels in Shenzhen, the hotel has been outdated."
1,房间还是蛮宽敞和干净的，早餐也不错，特别喜欢房间的落地窗，可惜上网收费不封顶，有点落伍了。,"The room is quite spacious and clean, and breakfast is also good. I especially like the floor -to -ceiling windows in the room. Unfortunately, it is a bit outdated."
1,虽然是老酒店，设备倒是很齐备，价格也合理。地点十分方便：旁边是大马路解放路，往南一直走就到车站，往北直走可到铁塔。酒店四周有难以计数的手机店，要缴通话费或买储值卡都很方便。设备齐全：连220V转110V的转接插座都有。自助早餐：是当地风味的中式餐点，内容丰富。服务态度：前台、客房服务、餐厅等人员都很和善，主动尽力为旅客提出帮助。人员服务态度真可比五星级。真要找出待改进的地方，就是浴室狭窄了点。,"Although it is an old hotel, the equipment is very ready and the price is reasonable.The location is very convenient: next to Da Da Road Jiefang Road, go south and go to the station, go north to the north can reach the tower.There are difficult to count mobile phone stores around the hotel. It is convenient to pay a call fee or buy a storage card.Complete equipment: Even 220V to 110V's transfer sockets are available.Buffet breakfast: It is a local Chinese meal with rich content.Service attitude: front desk, guest room services, restaurants and other personnel are very kind and take the initiative to help the passengers.Personnel service attitude is comparable to five -star.Really find out where to be improved is that the bathroom is narrow."
1,"上周末刚去杭州游玩回来,住的是这家新侨酒店.也是从携程订的,我的感受是:1)酒店位置真的很不错,离西湖非常近,而且在解放路上,又方便购物又方便找路.力顶!2)房间不知道该如何评论,我订了一间为大床房,在7楼,另一间是标准间,在16楼.感觉上7楼的房间比16楼的标准间要来得旧一点,我是说装修和设施的感觉,但是7楼的大床房反而倒比16楼的标间要贵.这个可能是房型条件所约束了的吧?3)门口还是有较多的人上来兜售西湖一日游包车,茶叶等等,很烦.4)酒店旁边的永和服务质量超差,叫了东西等了很久也不来,东西也做的粗糙不好吃.等去跟他们交涉的时候,他们的态度还很不耐烦.可能附近就这么一家快餐类的点心店吧,没有KFC和麦当劳.5)自驾车在酒店有免费的停车,很好.总之,我比较满意,特别是地段和免费停车的服务.下次如再去杭州,有机会的话还会住这家酒店.宾馆反馈2008年7月25日：尊敬的宾客，非常感谢您选择入住我们酒店并提出了那么多宝贵的意见。您提出的第三点意见，饭店非常重视，也已让安全部加强管理工作，尽量避免在酒店门口出现这种现象。至于房间问题，应该和装修风格有关系，而价格的确是根据房型来定的。您提到的KFC和麦当劳，其实饭店周边是有的，都在延安南路上，步行约5分钟。您下次入住我们酒店时，如有这方面的问题，可向总台服务员咨询，我们将随时为您提供帮助。","I just went back to Hangzhou last weekend and lived in this Xinqiao Hotel. It was also ordered from Ctrip. My feelings are: 1) The hotel location is really good, very close to West Lake, and on the road of liberation, it is convenient for shopping.It is also convenient for finding the road. Power Ding! 2) The room does not know how to comment. I booked one as a large bed room, on the 7th floor, the other is the standard room, on the 16th floor. I feel on the 7th floor.The standard room of the building must be older. I mean the feeling of decoration and facilities, but the large bed room on the 7th floor is more expensive than the standard room on the 16th floor. This may be restricted by the room type conditions? 3) At the doorThere are still many people who come to sell the one -day car, tea, etc. of the West Lake, very annoying .4) The quality of Yonghe's service next to the hotel was super poor.. When they negotiate with them, their attitude is still impatient. Maybe there is such a fast -food snack shop nearby, there is no KFC and McDonald's. 5) There are free parking in the hotel for self -driving.I am more satisfied, especially the service of the location and free parking. If you go to Hangzhou next time, if you have a chance, you will stay in this hotel. Hotel feedback on July 25, 2008: Dear guest, thank you very much for choosing to stay in our hotelAnd have made so many valuable opinions.The third point of view you put forward, the hotel attaches great importance to it, and has also allowed the Ministry of Safety to strengthen the management work and try to avoid this phenomenon at the door of the hotel.As for the room problem, it should be related to the decoration style, and the price is indeed determined according to the room type.The KFC and McDonald's you mentioned are actually around the restaurant. They are on Yan'an South Road for about 5 minutes.When you stay in our hotel next time, if you have any questions, you can consult the waiter in the general station. We will help you at any time."
1,酒店的位置一般，双塔中的一个竟然和写字楼共用一部电梯。环境服务都是高水准，早餐不错。,"The location of the hotel is average, and one in the double tower has an elevator with the office building.Environmental services are high levels, and breakfast is good."
0,酒店房间很小，成三角形－－卫生间设施陈旧低档服务态度差：服务员敲门象高利贷索帐，当我向酒店要一床厚被时，拿来的竟然是没有被罩，且粘满头发，令人作呕！后想起索要酒店袋子装东西－－竟然没有！！！后来拿了一个用过的塑料袋！房间邻街而且很冷！向其服务员说明后－－他竟然慢慢的说：＂这不是便宜嘛～＂说的那么自然！１１０一个房间还便宜！房价能打折但是服务一定不能打折！－－下次去郑州一定不会入住该酒店－－以上言论仅代表个人观点不针对第三方我对携程网的服务还是比较满意的,"The hotel room is very small, and it becomes a triangle -the old low -end service attitude of the toilet facilities is poor: the waiter knocked on the door of the usury lending account. When I asked the hotel with a thick quilt, the brought was not covered and covered with hair.People vomit!Later, I thought of asking for the hotel bag to install things -there was no!IntersectionIntersectionLater I took a plastic bag!The room is adjacent to the street and it is very cold!After explaining to his waiter -he said slowly, ""Isn't this cheap ~"" Said so naturally!110 rooms are cheap!House prices can be discounted but the service must not be discounted!——In the next time you go to Zhengzhou, you will not stay in the hotel -the above remarks only represent the personal point of view."
1,我到宜宾来办事都是喜欢住这个宾馆的，房间比较宽敞，服务相当周到，酒店的餐饮方面是非常好的，在餐厅点菜吃饭是很享受的，或许有人会说这个宾馆离市区比较远，因为宜宾比较脏乱，我们都是特地选择这个宾馆以求得干净与清净。,"When I come to Yibin to do things, I like to live in this hotel. The room is relatively spacious and the service is quite thoughtful. The hotel's catering is very good. It is very enjoyable to order in the restaurant. Maybe someone will say that this hotel is comparable to the city.Far, because Yibin is more dirty, we all choose this hotel to make cleanliness and purity."
1,我还是比较喜欢德州的凯苑温泉度假村便宜148元安静不会有电话打扰温泉也很好只是在开发区里城里远了点,I still like the Kaiyuan Hot Spring Resort in Texas. It is cheap for 148 yuan. There will be no call to disturb the hot spring.
1,"房间不错,这是我每次选择住在这里的原因.早餐不好,品种少,而且味道也不好.地理位置一般般.但总体的性价比好可以.","The room is good. This is why I choose to live here every time. The breakfast is not good, the variety is small, and the taste is not good. The geographical location is average. But the overall cost performance is good."
0,卫生设施太差，毛巾又黑又硬，下水道堵塞，床垫不好，睡上去不是很舒服。觉得服务态度还可以。对面就是长途汽车站，出租车蛮多的，出行还是很方便。,"The sanitary facilities are too poor, the towels are dark and hard, the sewer is blocked, the mattress is not good, and it is not very comfortable to sleep.I feel that the service attitude is okay.Opposite is the long -distance bus station. There are a lot of taxis, and travel is still very convenient."
1,位置好，服务不错；房间也不错；不过酒店的大堂和硬件离4星还是有点距离的,The location is good and the service is good; the room is also good; however
1,房间确实不错，床很大，早餐也很丰富．前台值班人太少，只有一到两个人值班，办理入住和退房时间比较长．,"The room is really good, the bed is large, and the breakfast is rich.There are too few people on duty at the front desk, only one or two people on duty."
1,价格适中，装修还可以。早餐尚可。物有所值,"The price is moderate, and the decoration is okay.Breakfast is okay.Value"
1,1、环境相对较安静，房间设施和整体效果很一般；2、早餐可吃的选择性不好，感觉东西倒是丰富、但可吃的比较少；3、房门的隔音效果不好（好象是很多酒店的通病）。,"1. The environment is relatively quiet, and the room facilities and overall effects are very average;It is a common problem for many hotels)."
0,说是4星的，居然没有设置无烟房，实在是无语。宾馆反馈2008年4月28日：尊敬的宾客，非常感谢您入住七星商务酒店！本酒店10楼为无烟楼层客房，楼层及客房均设有明显无烟楼层标志。我们诚挚地期待您下次光临我们酒店，我们将尽量满足您的订房需求。,"It is a 4 -star, and there is no smoke -free house, which is really speechless.Hotel feedback on April 28, 2008: Dear guests, thank you very much for staying in the Qixing Business Hotel!On the 10th floor of the hotel is a smoke -free floor room, with obvious smoke -free floors logos on floors and guest rooms.We sincerely look forward to your next visit to our hotel, and we will try to meet your reservation needs."
0,没有比这个更差劲的房间了，近火车站。服务一般般,"There is no worse room than this room, near the railway station.Serving"
1,总体环境不错服务也很好细节上处理的不错,The overall environment is good. The service is also very good. The details are handled well.
1,"房间干净整齐,服务员态度很好,不过餐厅一般.给我的早餐券上的套餐与餐厅的套餐不符","The room is clean and neat, and the waiter attitude is very good, but the restaurant is average. The package on my breakfast coupon does not match the set meal of the restaurant."
1,又涨价了！价格极端不稳定，不在携程订了，直接去前台。,"The price has increased again!The price is extremely unstable, and it is not booked in Ctrip, and goes directly to the front desk."
1,房间还可以，服务看得出是力求达到好，但总是差一点。不过这个特惠价的房间感觉还是不错的。有免费洗衣粉提供，这是第一次见到，看来客房部下功夫了。建议领导者多出去看看同类型的酒店设施会有很多启发。浴缸下水很慢，淋浴超过十分钟就要考虑停水等待它慢慢流走，如果一味痛快洗澡就意味着脚脖子被泡沫淹掉。赶紧改善吧～,"The room is okay. The service can see that it is good to achieve good, but it is always almost.But this special price room feels good.It is provided by free laundry powder. This is the first time I have seen it. It seems that the guest room department has worked hard.It is recommended that leaders go out and see more about the same type of hotel facilities.The bathtub is very slow. For more than ten minutes of the shower, it is necessary to consider stopping the water and wait for it to flow away slowly.Hurry up ~"
1,"四月间两次入住盐阜宾馆,都是在三号楼,感觉还行,位置很好.房间内的设施还行,比较大,但没有送餐的菜单(点的餐价格味道还是不错的),空调好像调温不够好,","Two times in the Yanfu Hotel in April, they are all in Building No. 3. It feels good and the location is good. The facilities in the room are okay.), The air conditioner seems to be not good enough,"
0,性价比就算可以，但地点有点背，很多出租车不太认识，又是单行路所以交通不是很方便。但考虑到价格因素，这家店还可以。就是房间带个窗户是露在走廊里，没窗帘隔音不好。所以私密性不是很好。,"Even if the price / performance ratio is okay, the location is a bit back. Many taxis do not know much, and it is a single way, so traffic is not very convenient.But considering the price factor, this shop is okay.It is that the room is exposed to the corridor without curtain sound insulation.So privacy is not very good."
1,早餐一般。2次去住都碰上有会议，看起来酒店生意很好啊。,"Breakfast is average.Two times, I met a meeting. It seems that the hotel business is very good."
1,服务态度很好，但就是做事拖拉。地段位置还比较方便。,"The service attitude is very good, but it is to drag.Location is relatively convenient."
1,定的景观房，但给出的房间基本没什么景观，两间都是这样，也懒的找前台再去理论，下次要住定标房就可以了。酒店的其他服务还是很好的。,"The designated landscape room, but the room given is basically no landscape, both of which are like this, and they are lazy to find the front desk and then go to the theory.The hotel's other services are still very good."
1,很好，这次入住酒店帮我免费升级为商务间，说是给携程的年终优惠，意外地满意。宾馆反馈2008年1月16日：感谢您对大连银帆宾馆的满意和支持！商务间是比基础房型豪华间高两个级别的全新房型，目前推出年终回馈498元商务间升级活动，希望大家更喜欢我们的新房间、新银帆！银帆宾馆欢迎您！,"Very good, this time I stayed in the hotel to help me upgrade to a business room for free, saying that it was a year -end discount for Ctrip, which was unexpectedly satisfied.Hotel feedback on January 16, 2008: Thank you for your satisfaction and support for Dalian Yinfan Hotel!Business room is a new room type of two levels of high -level luxury rooms. At present, the year -end rewards 498 yuan business room upgrade activity. I hope everyone likes our new rooms and new silver sails!Welcome to Yinfan Hotel!"
1,"房间设施不错,服务没问题,早餐也不错,就是打车难,不过,还是直的住,有一点,前台动作较慢,前台服务还要加强","The room facilities are good, the service is okay, and the breakfast is also good. It is difficult to take a taxi."
0,"这个酒店，隔音太差，都是用木板隔的。有纯净饮用水口，但是坏了,也不配给免费矿泉水。房间设置也是不好的。我的同事房间淋浴口竟然不出水。奉劝大家不要去住。","In this hotel, the sound insulation is too poor, all of which are separated by wooden boards.There are pure drinking water mouths, but it is broken, and it is not assigned to free mineral water.The room settings are also not good.The shower port of my colleague's room was not water.I advise everyone not to live."
1,新装修过了，液晶壁挂电视，很不错。不过，酒店热水采用温泉，水不是很大，而且有些粘乎乎的感觉，成为房间唯一的美中不足。自助餐，可能由于便宜的缘故，办的时间一长，客人来得多了，但是质量和服务却下降许多了。,"Newly renovated, LCD wall -mounted TV, very good.However, the hot water in the hotel is hot spring, the water is not very large, and it is a bit sticky, becoming the only beauty in the room.Self -service service may have been in the same time because of cheap, and the guests have come much, but the quality and service have decreased a lot."
0,6月26日予定7月2日入住的房间1、6月27日得到确认。2、7月2日早上来电说给我们房间升级。3、办理入住，却把我们放到了离开海边很远的天津工人疗养院，曰：有会议，没有房间，周围事工地、房间霉味严重、离海500米。原来这就是升级！3、很官僚的机关作风。以上就是经历。,"On June 26th, the rooms that stayed on July 2 were confirmed on June 27.2. The call in the morning on July 2 said to the room upgrade to our room.3. Check in, but put us in the Tianjin workers' nursing home far away from the seaside. It is said: There are conferences, no rooms, and the surrounding affairs sites, room moldy, and 500 meters away from the sea.It turns out that this is upgrade!3. The style of the bureaucracy.The above is the experience."
1,这家YMCA非常好，还主动帮我们升级房间，住起又棒又舒适，地点也很方便，服务又好，号称香港物美价优第一流的YMCA，值得大家推荐。,"This YMCA is very good. It also takes the initiative to help us upgrade the room. It is great and comfortable to live. The location is very convenient and the service is good. The YMCA, which is known as the first -led price of Hong Kong, is worth recommending."
0,"非常不满这酒店，配不上5星。第一,客房服务员没有水平,房卡出问题，叫了20分钟仍没有人出来开门。第二,电掣跳闸..也等了15分钟才有人上来。第三,服务员没有礼貌,说话太不象话,前台也有些接待人员完全不懂操作。第四,也就是最不满意的,就是身为5星级的酒店，门口那些出租车司机胡乱开价,我们就像水鱼被人宰...我们说开价太贵,他们竟然说从5星级出来,讨价还价,会影响我们身份..这是什么道理?害得我们找不到车...这是我住的第一次遇到这样的5星级酒店,出现这样没有水平的配套。垃圾...........补充点评2007年12月10日：还有床太不象话了，睡的时候床垫竟然可以感觉到弹簧的铁丝…睡得很不舒服","I am very dissatisfied with this hotel, not worth 5 stars.First, the guest room waiter is not level. There is a problem with the room card. After 20 minutes, no one came out to open the door.Second, the galloped trip .. I waited for 15 minutes before someone came up.Third, the waiter is not polite, speaks too much, and some receptionists at the front desk do not understand the operation at all.Fourth, the most dissatisfied is the 5 -star hotel. Those taxi drivers at the door are randomly opened.Come out, bargaining will affect our identity. What is the truth? It makes us unable to find a car ... This is the first time I lived in such a 5 -star hotel. There is no level of supporting facilities.Trash ......... Supplementary comment on December 10, 2007: There is still a bed that is too unreasonable. When you sleep, you can feel the spring of the spring ... sleeping very uncomfortably"
1,08年2月份入住的大床房，非常满意。的确是5星的水平，当时的价格也低。下次有机会还会去。,"The large bed room stayed in February 2008 was very satisfied.It was indeed a level of 5 stars, and the price was low at the time.I will go next time."
1,因为见客户的需要，只住了一次，因为以前都是住５星的而且很新的，所以这次去感觉没那么好了．很多方面还需要改进,"Because I saw the customer's needs, I lived only once, because I used to live 5 stars and very new, so I felt that I didn't do it this time.Many aspects need to be improved"
0,住了特价的房间，实在是差的没法说了，房间小得完全出乎意料，像个剩余的角落留出来的空间弄了这么一个房间。还有停车场，实在不方便，而且地下三层，而且非常的陈旧，去停车场的电梯怕怕。第一次遇到这么差的停车场。下次不再去，永远也不去。宾馆反馈2008年8月4日：尊敬的客人您好，首先感谢您对酒店的评价，对于您在酒店的遭遇我们深表歉意，酒店除了特价大床房之外还有其他多种房型可供您选择，对于停车如您遇到困难可向前台与酒店安保部门联系，我们会第一时间为您解决。我们还是希望您能再次光临，在下次入住之时会给您一个不一样的感觉！,"I lived in a special room, and I couldn't say it. The room was completely unexpected, like a room left like a remaining corner.There is also a parking lot, which is really inconvenient, and the underground is three floors, and it is very old. The elevator to the parking lot is afraid.The first time I encountered such a poor parking lot.I won't go next time, never go.Hotel feedback on August 4, 2008: Dear guests, first of all, thank you for your evaluation of the hotel. For your encounter in the hotel, we apologize. In addition to the special large -scale bedroom roomIf you choose, if you encounter difficulties, you can contact the hotel security department with the front platform. We will solve it for you as soon as possible.We still hope that you can come again, and you will give you a different feeling at the next time you stay!"
1,酒店位置不错，近皇岗口岸，房间也还好，床比较舒适，就是有些小。,"The hotel location is good, near Huanggang port, the room is also good, the bed is more comfortable, but it is a bit small."
0,这种酒店居然是五星，不知道怎么评的。服务意识差，我入住酒店时，提了两个大箱子进去，门迎居然动也不动。以次充好，我订的是大床房，给我的是两张房拼到一起的，居然就叫大房床了，空间小得可怜，投诉前台，无果；于是投诉到携程，最后长级。旧，这一点我就不说了，别人已经都写了。吃饭要很长时间，要了一个果盘，一个简单的果盘，吃过饭一个小时才上来。总之，下次不会再住了。,"This hotel is actually five -star, I don't know how to comment.The service awareness was poor. When I checked in the hotel, I mentioned two large boxes in, and the door welcomed.If you charge this time, I booked a large bed room. What I gave me was to fight together. It was called a large bed bed.Gong.Old, I won't say this, others have already written.It takes a long time to eat, it takes a fruit plate, a simple fruit plate, and I have eaten for an hour to come up.In short, I won't live again next time."
1,服务人员态度很好，房间干净，网络速度可以。作为不到300元的四星酒店，还是物有所值的。不过，有骚扰电话。值得推荐。,"The attitude of the service staff is very good, the room is clean, and the network speed is okay.As a four -star hotel less than 300 yuan, it is still worth it.However, there are harassment calls.Recommended."
1,"酒店境和服度亦算不,但房空太小~~不宣容太大件行李~~且房格可以~~中餐的心不太好吃~~要改善之~~~~但算平宜~~可接受~~西餐格都很好~~但吃的味道一般且令人等得太耐了~~要改善之~~","The hotel's realm is also good, but the room is too small ~~ I do n’t declare too much luggage ~~ And the room is OK ~~ The heart of Chinese food is not delicious ~~ It is necessary to improve it ~~~~~~ Acceptable ~~ Western food is very good ~~ But the taste of eating is average and it is too resistant to it ~~ I want to improve it ~~"
0,"这酒店太旧了,大厅看上去还可以.房间的设施成旧不堪!卫生间的马桶真的都不走水的.早餐太一般了.要去入住的朋友要有思想准备,期望值不要太高.400多一晚说实话不太值!!","This hotel is too old, and the lobby looks okay. The facilities in the room are unbearable! The toilet in the bathroom is really not water. Breakfast is too average. Friends who want to stay in are prepared for thought, and the expectations should not be too high.It is not worth the truth about 400 a day !!"
1,酒店位于居民小区里面，晚上很安静，根本感觉不到这是一家位于北2环和3环之间的酒店，比较干净，酒店房间也比较大，早餐品种太少，质量一般般！,"The hotel is located in the residential community. It is very quiet at night. I ca n’t feel that this is a hotel located between the North 2 and 3 rings. It is relatively clean, the hotel room is relatively large, the breakfast varieties are too small, and the quality is general!"
1,"酒店比较老,但是设备维护的还是不错.服务不错,比较细心周围,晚上回来开了夜床,感觉很好.楼下商场据说算济南最好的，感觉不错~~`下次还住这里","The hotel is older, but the equipment is well maintained. The service is good, the service is more carefully, and I came back to open the night bed at night. It feels good. It is said that the downstairs mall is said to be the best in Jinan."
1,我们在酒店用的是亲子游套餐。酒店和周边环境很好，服务人员热情有礼。非常满意。饮食价廉物美。下次若有机会，我们会再来该酒店。,"We use parent -child travel sets in the hotel.The hotel and the surrounding environment are very good, and the service staff is enthusiastic.Very satisfied.The price of diet is cheap.If there is a chance next time, we will come to the hotel again."
1,很不错，大堂很豪华，甚至太豪华了。房间很大，卫生间很好。就是早餐差了一点。为什么菜不再多一点呢？早餐很重要。,"Very good, the lobby is luxurious, even too luxurious.The room is large and the bathroom is very good.It is a bit worse for breakfast.Why no more dishes?Breakfast is important."
1,地理位置优越，交通方便，饭店环境好，服务优良，洗衣迅捷。,"Good geographical location, convenient transportation, good restaurant environment, good service, and fast laundry."
1,"晚餐是房间叫餐的,价格不贵,速度也较快.房间很大,床也大,感觉不错.","Dinner is called meals, the price is not expensive, the speed is fast. The room is large, the bed is large, and it feels good."
1,我和LD总共住了7天6晚，每天有2块巧克力送，酒店的早餐很好。服务员很热情，只要你出去，回来后房间就打扫。不管出去几次，这点很好，很负责！床很大，枕头也是超大的，很舒服！总体感觉不错！没有不满意的地方！,"I lived with LD for a total of 7 days and 6 nights. There were 2 chocolates every day. The breakfast in the hotel was very good.The waiter is very enthusiastic. As long as you go out, the room will be cleaned after returning.No matter how many times you go out, this is very good, very responsible!The bed is very large, the pillow is too large, very comfortable!It feels good overall!No dissatisfaction!"
0,价格不低，档次不高，环境糟糕，大厅很小，房间一般，早餐难吃，感觉一般！,"The price is not low, the grade is not high, the environment is bad, the hall is small, the room is average, the breakfast is difficult to eat, it feels average!"
1,为客户订了3次房，感觉不错。下次还是会选择该酒店。,"I booked a room 3 times for customers, and it feels good.The hotel will be selected next time."
1,*房间很不错，服务很好，就是位置偏点，在机场到市区的路边，打车到江北商业圈起步价。*早餐不错。,"*The room is very good, the service is very good, that is, the location is too much. At the roadside from the airport to the city, take a taxi to the Jiangbei commercial circle to start the starting price.*Breakfast is good."
1,"各方面都还行.只是可能因价格便宜,客人素质较差.常有在走廊上大呼小叫.",It is okay in all aspects. It may be because the price is cheap and the quality of the guests is poor. It is often shouted in the corridor.
0,酒店位置比地址说明上的偏多了，接近市郊，路边连个明确的牌子都没打出，失望。酒店外观还算过得去，大堂却很一般（有点像旅社的大堂），走廊和房间的装修都较陈旧，和携程发布的图片相去甚远。洗漱用品配备简陋，大概也就是个三星的级别。同等价位，比起曾经住过的天河购物中心附近的广州皇家国际饭店无论装修还是服务，甚至连自助早，都要差很多。订房的时候总想不起皇家国际饭店的具体名字，才定了这个饭店，真是悔啊。以后到广州不会再选择这里，绝不~~,"The location of the hotel is more than that of the address description. Near the suburbs, there was no clear brand on the side of the road and disappointed.The appearance of the hotel is still available, but the lobby is very average (a bit like the lobby of the hostel). The corridor and the room decoration are older, and it is far from the pictures released by Ctrip.Washing supplies are rude, which is probably a Samsung level.At the same price, compared to the Guangzhou Royal International Hotel near the Tianhe Shopping Center where once lived, regardless of whether it is decorated or service, it is much worse than that of self -service.I ca n’t remember the specific name of the Royal International Hotel when I reservations. I ’m determined that this hotel is really regretful.I won't choose here in Guangzhou in the future, never ~~"
1,我预定了大床间，可是所谓的大床只有1.5米宽，房间倒是很大。值得推荐的是自助餐，酒店客人50元/人，还是不错的。但餐厅服务员难得见到笑容，而且不太理睬客人的招呼，不好。,"I booked a big bed, but the so -called large bed was only 1.5 meters wide, and the room was very large.It is worth recommending buffets. The hotel guests are 50 yuan/person, which is still good.But the restaurant waiter rare to see a smile, and ignored the greetings of the guests. It was not good."
0,10多年来住过的近百家3星酒店中，这家酒店的服务、房间、餐饮简直是“好”的无话可说！！！向大堂经理反映问题，大堂经理的答复是“去315投诉吧”（入住当天是3月12日），真强悍！！！,"Of the nearly a hundred 3 -star hotels that have lived in for more than 10 years, the service, room, and catering of this hotel are nothing to say!IntersectionIntersectionReflecting the question to the lobby manager, the lobby manager's answer is ""Go to 315 to complain"" (the day of the check -in is March 12), so powerful!IntersectionIntersection"
0,1、内部装修尚可，但周围环境差，房间小，所以房间价格偏高，不划算。2、双人房间的床只有大约1米宽。感觉很不好，像童床。3、早餐标价竟然56元，而且品种很少。如果房间不包早餐，千万别去，抢钱一样。中餐、午餐均不开，想吃饭，那就顶着太阳往远处找吧。4、最近因为工作原因，跑过很多城市，住过不少酒店，这是偶遇到的惟一一家上网收费的中档酒店（可能是偶孤陋寡闻了）。每天36大元，简直不可理喻。加房费超过400块了，对于这样的房间有点离谱。5、房间空调声音太大，而且效果不好，不是一般的不好。不知道其他房间怎样。6、一个插曲：俺入住时打开房门，过道竟放一铁架，内装一正在运转的压缩机在轰鸣，正好把过道堵上。俺只好把行李放在走廊，电话通知服务员来把它拿走，结果竟然通知了三次、等了10分钟才来人把机器拖走，而且一句道歉的话都没有。7、电视机2-18几乎都是国外频道，日语居多。感觉不爽。补充点评2007年7月3日：有点笔误：应该是：中餐、晚餐均不开,"1. The interior decoration is acceptable, but the surrounding environment is poor and the room is small, so the room price is high and not cost -effective.2. The bed in the double room is only about 1 meter wide.It feels bad, like a bedding.3. Breakfast price is 56 yuan, and there are very few varieties.If the room does not include breakfast, don't go, grab money.Chinese food and lunch are not opened. If you want to eat, then look at the sun to find.4. Recently, due to work reasons, I have run through many cities and live in many hotels. This is the only mid -range hotel charged on the Internet that I have encountered (maybe I was ignorant).36 yuan a day is unreasonable.The increase in the house is more than 400 yuan, which is a bit outrageous for such a room.5. The sound of air conditioning in the room is too loud, and the effect is not good, not generally bad.I don't know what other rooms are.6. A episode: When I move in, I opened the door of the room, and the aisle was placed with an iron frame. The interior was running in the interior, which was stunned, and it just blocked the aisle.I had to put my luggage in the corridor, and the call notified the waiter to take it away. As a result, I notified it three times and waited for 10 minutes before they dragged the machine away, and there was no apology.7. TVs 2-18 are almost foreign channels, most of them Japanese.It feels uncomfortable.Supplementary review July 3, 2007: A little error: It should be: Chinese food and dinner are not opened"
0,地方恶偏，早餐可以比美招待所，服务员素质巨差，坚决不去第二趟,"The place is evil, and breakfast can be more bad than the US reception."
1,总体感觉还行，最值得称道的是不断的改进。最初没有提供浴袍，后来也提供了。后来也提供了免费的矿泉水，不知是否下次提供免费的水果吧？这样就像一个四星级酒店了,"Overall feeling is okay, the most commendable is continuous improvement.I did not provide a bathrobe at first, and it was later provided.Later, free mineral water was also provided. I wonder if the free fruit will be provided next time?This is like a four -star hotel"
0,所谓高级大床房，超级无量小。洗脸盆是在卧室里的，淋浴房也是在卧室里的。一大早还没睡醒就有人使用电动钻施工修理。价格偏高，携程价毫无优势，只比前台价便宜9元，而且其他的客人所付房前均比携程低。,"The so -called high -end large bed room is super infinite.The washbasin is in the bedroom, and the shower room is also in the bedroom.Someone used electric drills to build it before waking up early in the morning.The price is high, and the price of Ctrip has no advantage. It is only 9 yuan cheaper than the front price, and the house paid by other guests is lower than Ctrip."
1,早餐比较差，别的都还好啦。离香洲汽车站满近的，步行不到10分钟也就到了。这点满方便的。,"Breakfast is worse, everything else is fine.It is close to Xiangzhou Bus Station, and it will arrive in less than 10 minutes.This is convenient."
1,前台态度一般，效率较佳，房间虽略显陈旧但干净整洁，设施完备，蒸气浴不错。性价比还是值得一去的,"The attitude of the front desk is average, and the efficiency is better. Although the room is slightly old but clean and tidy, the facilities are complete, and the steam bath is good.The cost -effective is still worth going"
1,房间很干净。虽然小，但是由于有心理准备，也觉得不错。到奥运站走10分钟左右就到。缺点就是附近都是工厂区，回来得晚的话没有什么地方能吃东西。总的来说，还是值得去住的。,"The room is very clean.Although it is small, it feels good due to psychological preparation.Go to the Olympic Station for about 10 minutes.The disadvantage is that there are factory districts nearby. If you come back late, there is no place to eat.Overall, it is worth living."
1,"比较高的性价比,环境服务都不错.68的自助餐也还不错,每人给10块钱的抵现券,58/人.就是不知道有没有停车场,大厅门口的停车位非常有限.宾馆反馈2008年7月31日：感谢您选择国宾大酒店入住，并对酒店予以认可。酒店负一层有专门的停车场，门前、后院及负一停车场都能供您停车使用。期待您的再次光临！祝生活愉快，工作顺利！","The high cost performance, the environmental service is good.

The front, backyard and negative parking lot can be used for you to park.welcome next time!I wish you a happy life and a smooth work!"
0,"位置稍偏,好在曲阜本来地方就不大.房间设施一般,较陈旧.","The location is slightly quite small, but it is not large that the place in Qufu was originally large."
1,前台的服务很不错，快捷、周到、让人感觉很好。房间环境还可以，就是床垫太差，躺在上面能感觉到弹簧，该换了。,"The front desk service is very good, fast, thoughtful, and feels good.The environment of the room is okay, that is, the mattress is too poor. You can feel the spring lying on it, which should be changed."
1,我是帮朋友定的，他是第一次去香港，他的评价是：比一般的标间好象小一点，房间的隔音不是很好，服务还算不错。交通是很方便，下楼就有地铁，但是961元的价钱好象高了点，下次再去情愿再住的远点价钱便宜，反正坐地铁住远点也就10分钟的时间够了,"I was settled by a friend. He went to Hong Kong for the first time. His evaluation was: it seemed smaller than the normal standard room. The sound insulation in the room was not very good, and the service was pretty good.The transportation is very convenient. There is a subway when you go downstairs, but the price of 961 yuan seems to be a bit high."
0,总体感觉很差！房间设施、服务，还有自助早餐非常差（品种少，本人曾问服务员怎么没有荤菜肉菜，答复：鸡蛋不是荤菜吗？）,"The overall feels bad!Room facilities, services, and very poor buffet breakfast (there are few varieties, I have asked the waiter why there is no meat dishes, and the response: Isn't eggs be amaranth?)"
1,"本次入住的是豪华房,床很大而且很舒适,房间面积也很大,灯光协调,落地玻璃窗视野宽广,可以看到海景,隔海对面就是香港.交通也很便利,服务人员非常周到,挺细心的,前台及楼层服务员的态度都很好,以后来深圳都会住。","This time I stayed in a luxurious room, the bed was very large and comfortable, the room area was very large, the lights were coordinated, the floor -to -ceiling glass window vision was wide. You can see the sea view. The opposite of the sea is Hong Kong.Careful, the attitude of the front desk and floor waiters is very good, and will live in Shenzhen in the future."
0,"房间有点旧,应该要重新装修,不然将会走下坡","The room is a bit old and should be renovated, otherwise it will go downhill"
1,环境确实不错，吃喝玩乐一应俱全，足不出户就可以享受，不过周边环境太差，除了酒店，其他没什么看头。有可能是日本人多还是有日本股份，房间有很多日文，还有一层楼是用日式做的房间（没有房，是TATAMI式的）。在那里吃过西餐和粤菜，都很好，价钱也便宜。服务也蛮好的，性价比很高，值得推荐。,"The environment is really good. Eating, drinking, and fun are all available. You can enjoy it without leaving home, but the surrounding environment is too poor. Except for hotels, there is nothing to look at.It may be that there are many Japanese still have Japanese shares. There are many Japanese in the room, and there are rooms made of Japanese -style (no room, which is TataMi).I have eaten Western and Cantonese cuisine there, and the price is cheap.The service is also quite good, the cost performance is very high, it is worth recommending."
1,B套房的2个床怎么那么小，只有90厘米（2月9日花了1000元，有点不值）。菜色味道还可以，风景也可以（雪景不错）。,"Why is the two beds in the B suite so small, only 90 cm (spent 1,000 yuan on February 9th, a bit worth).The dishes are okay, and the scenery is also available (the snow scene is good)."
1,总体还可以，交通购物比较方便，设备在宜宾算是还可以了。早餐实在太差，去了3次，每次1周。。。去到第二次也就不能在那吃了。。。每天都一样，品种还那么少。。。恩，晚餐的套餐也就1种。。。,"Overall, transportation and shopping is more convenient, and equipment is okay in Yibin.Breakfast is too bad, goes 3 times, each time for 1 week.EssenceEssenceYou can't eat there for the second time.EssenceEssenceEvery day, there are so few varieties.EssenceEssenceWell, there is also one set of dinner.EssenceEssence"
1,"此次入住感觉不错,销售部服务到位,大堂经理能理解客人的需要,做出相应的措施,下次还要入住....","This time I feel good, the sales department's service is in place, the lobby manager can understand the needs of the guests, take corresponding measures, and stay in the next time ..."
1,"非常好!订的是标房,入住当天升级为豪标.房间干净,服务热情.如果房间的窗户能打开(透透气),就更好!","Very good! Booking a standard room, upgrade to the bid for the day of check -in. The room is clean and the service is enthusiastic. If the window of the room can be opened (breathless), it is better!"
0,我要求里写了要安静的房间。。谁知道那天住在6楼，外面的风，凄惨的吹着，声音很大，一个小时才入睡。让酒店换房间。他们说，酒店周围没有树，每间房间声音都很大。。赫赫，这里理由么？看来下次，起风的时候就不能去住了。,"I asked for a quiet room.EssenceWho knew that the day of living on the 6th floor, the wind outside, the miserable blow, the sound was loud, and I fell asleep an hour.Let the hotel change the room.They said that there were no trees around the hotel, and every room was loud.EssenceHehe, is the reason here?It seems that next time, it will not be able to live when the wind is in the wind."
1,"很棒的艺术酒店5－6日外出踏青,一行入住珠海中邦商务酒店。这酒店开业几年了、给住客的感觉却仍旧很新鲜，最近还被评为中国首批“艺术主题特色酒店”,从中邦的内刊了解到业主更计划扩展规模---在附近兴建一座新的艺术酒店。3年前，我曾以这个建筑在情侣中路的偶遇于写过一篇文字，2年前也曾往杭州探访过这个酒店的设计师---由室内设计师,平面设计师和舞美设计师组成的,很棒的一个新锐设计团队。","The great art hotel went out on the 5-6 days, and went to Zhuhai Zhongbang Business Hotel.This hotel has opened for a few years, but the feeling of giving guests is still very fresh.

Two years ago, I also visited the designer of this hotel in Hangzhou-the interior designer, graphic designer and Wumei designerA great emerging design team formed."
1,酒店环境不错哦，在市中心，但是很安静．因为占地面积很大（保安说酒店有250个车位orz~~）．和一般的酒店不一样，闽西宾馆有６栋楼，可能是价位不同的原因吧．因为这次是自费的，所以选了比较便宜的５号楼．房间还好了，倒是边上９号楼前的小花园很讨人喜欢；还有５号楼后面的农家屋，葡萄架后是古色古香的矮平房，很有＂曲径通幽＂的味道～～特别要表扬下５号楼的服务员小妹，人很好哦～我笔记本坏了，她带我去６号楼商务中心上网（住客都是免费的～）还帮我找了个技术员修理笔记本～多谢哈～～,"The hotel environment is good, in the city center, but very quiet.Because it covers a large area (security said that the hotel has 250 parking spaces orz ~~).Unlike ordinary hotels, there are 6 buildings in the Western Ministry of West, which may be the reason why the price is different.Because this time it was at their own expense, I chose the cheaper Building 5.The room is okay, but the small garden in front of Building 9 is very flattering; there is also the farmhouse behind Building 5, and the grape frame is an antique dwarf house.~ In particular, I want to praise the waiter in Building 5, and the person is very good ~ My notebook is bad. She took me to the business center of Building 6 to go online (the residents are free ~) also helped me find a technician to repair it.Notebook ~ Thank you, thank you ~~"
1,感觉卫生还可以，交通方便，价格也便宜，就是房间没窗户.,"It feels that hygiene is okay, convenient transportation, and cheap price, that is, there are no windows in the room."
1,"这家酒店位置,房间性价比都不错的.但不知是不是由于客人多,服务自然下降.携程的客人好象在这里不太受欢迎.每次入住,要不是订的大床间没有,要不是房间没有,要不是还没有打扫出来.而且不能积会员卡的分.前台说是上面规定的,也没有什么依据.补充点评2007年12月9日：这家酒店的服务越来越差,酒店设施也旧了,大不如从前.以后不住了.","The location of this hotel is good at cost performance. But I do n’t know if there are many guests and the service naturally declined. Ctrip's guests seem to be not very popular here. Each time I checked in, if it ’s not in the big bed, or if it was not or not, it was not or not. There is no room, if it has not been cleaned yet. And the division of the membership card cannot be accumulated. The front desk is said to be above, and there is no basis for replenishment on December 9, 2007: The service of this hotel is getting worse and worse, the hotel is getting worse and worse, the hotel The facilities are also old, it is worse than before. I can't help it in the future."
1,酒店地理位置在古城区最繁华的十全街上，环境非常好，很有园林特色，让人感到很舒服很惬意！前台入住和退房的速度也很快，服务人员很友善，有问必答！房间也很有特色，墙上刻有金色的诗词，听说每个房间的诗词都不同呢！下次还会选择这里！,"The geographical location of the hotel is on the most prosperous street in the ancient city. The environment is very good and has garden characteristics, which makes people feel comfortable and comfortable!The speed of check -in and check -in at the front desk is also very fast. The service staff is very friendly and must answer questions!The room is also very distinctive, with golden poems engraved on the wall. I heard that the poems in each room are different!I will choose here next time!"
0,订的豪华标间，738元的价格，住过的同等对比是最差的。周边环境除了一地铁口没有其它，餐厅不行，周边也找不着吃的。房间小，住了两天还有一天晚上没水，宽带收费40，打印贡献了几十个10元。绝对不值。,"The luxury bidding room, the price of 738 yuan, the same contrast that has lived is the worst.Except for the surrounding environment, there is no other subway entrance, the restaurant is not good, and the surroundings can not be found.The room was small, and there was no water for two days to live for two days. Broadband charged 40, and the printing contributed dozens of 10 yuan.Definitely not worth it."
1,房间很大，环境不错。云台山风景也好的。就是当心遇上非正规导游的：（,The room is large and the environment is good.The scenery of Yuntai Mountain is also good.Just meet an informal tour guide in the heart: ((((((
1,未入住前，看了上面的点评还是有些不安的。入住后感觉还可以，在芜湖这个地方，说实在的能住到这样的宾馆应该说是不错了。以后去芜湖还会选择该酒店的。,"Before checking in, I was still a little uneasy after watching the review above.It feels okay after check -in. In Wuhu, it should be said that it is good to be able to stay in such a hotel.In the future, I will choose the hotel in Wuhu."
0,"酒店前台小女孩子服务太次,态度很差.好象没干过这行.建议经理好好管理管理.酒店位置好,别的就没有什么可以赞扬的了.","The little girl at the front desk of the hotel is too much, and the attitude is very poor. It seems that I have never done this. It is recommended that the manager manage it well. The location of the hotel is good. There is nothing to praise."
1,好。。。房间的梳子非常好，现在家里一直用。。下次还得入住，把免费的梳子拿回家。。哈哈哈哈哈。。。地理位置不好，很安静，还算比较好叫出租车，但是周边餐饮基本没有，在一楼餐厅吃了碗西红柿鸡蛋面。。。还不错。。,"good.EssenceEssenceThe combing of the room is very good, and now I have been using it at home.EssenceI have to stay next time and take the free comb home.EssenceHahahahaha.EssenceEssenceThe geographical location is not good, very quiet, and it is relatively easy to call taxis, but there is basically no surrounding catering. I ate a bowl of tomato egg noodles on the first floor restaurant.EssenceEssencenot bad.Essence"
1,不是特别满意位置不太好但价格比较合理去了才知道，他是3星级的，外表有点旧旧的,"It's not particularly satisfactory, but the price is relatively reasonable. I know that he is 3 -star. The appearance is a bit old."
1,环境。房间设施都可以，只是在早餐时服务员素质一般，可能是附近农村找来的，连外国住客最基本的英语都听不懂，很遗憾。,"environment.The room facilities are fine, but the quality of the waiter is average during breakfast. It may be found by nearby rural areas. Even the most basic English English of foreign residents can't understand it. It is a pity."
0,1.酒店的服务不太好，而且酒店的卫生条件令人担心。2.换了两个房间床单上都有血迹。3.酒店服务员对出现这种情况没有合理的解释，还指责客户没有看清楚。,"1. The hotel's service is not very good, and the hygiene conditions of the hotel are worrying.2. There are blood stains on the sheets of two rooms.3. The hotel waiter has no reasonable explanation of this situation, and accuses customers of not seeing it clearly."
1,服务和房间都挺不错的，早餐也很丰富，下次还会选择入住。,"The service and room are very good, and the breakfast is also very rich. I will choose to stay next time."
1,由于是从上海转机回东京，所以又在这里住了一晚。不知道为什么，感觉房间好像比上回小了一些，由于是周末，被告知是特价放，但是不带早餐了。难道说周末的时候，酒店员工休息，为了减少工作负荷压力，就不给早餐了么？如果还是和平是一样的房间环境和单早的话，个人认为价格还是很已被接受的，毕竟上海市个大地方，啥都不便宜呢,"Since I returned from Shanghai to Tokyo, I lived here for another night.I do n’t know why, I feel that the room seems to be smaller than last time. Because it was a weekend, the argument was that it was special, but no breakfast was.Does it mean that during the weekend, the hotel employee rests. In order to reduce the pressure of work load, will you not give breakfast?If there is still the same room environment and early alone, I personally think that the price is still accepted. After all, it is not cheap in Shanghai."
0,不能兑现预订的酒店是全世界最差的酒店，譬如这家万里路国际青年酒店。补充点评2008年1月14日：订好了的，到了酒店说没房。……,"The hotel that cannot be reached is the worst hotel in the world, such as this Wanli Road International Young Hotel.Supplementary comment on January 14, 2008: I booked it, and I said there was no house at the hotel.Nympho"
0,"房间的格局在风水中属败相,卫生间马桶堵塞,无奈的一晚!!!","The pattern of the room is defeated in Feng Shui, the toilet toilet is blocked, a helpless night !!!"
1,群山环绕之中的温泉酒店，空气、水质都是没话说的，但酒店的服务细节还很不到位。因为没有公共交通直达，自驾车比较方便，否则需要叫路边的私车送达。很适合度假的地方，要是长住可以多打折就好了。,"The hot spring hotels surrounded by mountains, air and water quality are nothing to say, but the service details of the hotel are not in place.Because there is no direct public transportation, it is more convenient to drive by car, otherwise you need to call the roadside private car.It is very suitable for vacation. If you stay long, you can discount more."
1,"我住过不少上海和北京的如家酒店,但上海浦东的张江和美酒店是我住过的如家酒店中我见过的最好的一家,房间宽大、干净，楼下餐厅的饭菜也不错，尤其是10元钱的早餐，决不比四星级酒店差，因在开发区，交通不太方便，周边也没有什么服务设施，所以这里适合来开发区出差的人住，比较安静。","I have lived in a lot of hotels in Shanghai and Beijing, but Zhangjiang and Hotels in Pudong, Shanghai are the best one I have seen in the Rujia Hotel I have lived in. The rooms are wide and clean.It is a 10 yuan breakfast, which is no longer worse than a four -star hotel. Because in the development zone, traffic is not convenient, and there are no service facilities around the surrounding area. Therefore, it is suitable for people who travel to the development zone to live in a quieter."
0,"这是我住过最差最差的酒店,夜里十一点服务员们在楼道大声喧哗聊天,其中两个服务员为谁干的活多活少还吵了起来,早上六点服务员就敲门要求搞卫生,我晕....环境差得不是一星半点,甚至不如我在坝上草原的农家院干净,建议携程对其提供的酒店都要进行实地考察一下,别辜负我们对携程的信任!","This is the worst and worst hotel I have lived. At 11 o'clock in the night, the waiters talked loudly on the corridor. Two of them were quarreling for who did more lives.Sanitary, I am dizzy .... The environment is not a little bit worse, and it is even as clean as me in the farmhouse in the grassland. It is suggested that Ctrip must conduct a field inspection of the hotels provided by it, don't live up to our trust in Ctrip!"
1,由于延安路上在进行轨道交通的施工，所以交通情况不是很好，一开始叫车都不知道能不能在延安路上叫。刚进去感觉不是很好，有股味道，房间内也是。豪华标间没有介绍的30平米，有点小，布局还不错。工作人员还是蛮热情的。补充点评2008年8月13日：房间里面的床貌似不是非常干净，第一个晚上脚脖子那边就起了好多红块块，超级痒，这点让我有点后怕。,"Because the construction of rail transit on the Yan'an Road, the traffic was not very good. At first, I didn't know if I could call Yanan Road.I didn't feel very good when I just entered, it has a stocking, and so is the room.The 30 square meters introduced in the luxury standard room is a bit small and the layout is not bad.The staff is quite enthusiastic.Supplementary comment on August 13, 2008: The bed in the room seems not very clean. The first night of the nipples, there were a lot of red pieces, super itchy, which made me a little scared."
1,非常感谢携程的服务。因为酒店与携程之间的优惠活动，才有这样440元可以入驻豪华房间这样的非常实惠的价格。而且酒店的服务也很到位。将近半个月的入住，给我留下了非常好的印象。虽然以前也住过该酒店，但住的是不同的房型，这次的评语适用于17楼的豪华房间。,"Thank you very much for your service.Because the preferential activities between hotels and Ctrip can there be such a very affordable price such as 440 yuan to settle in luxury rooms.And the hotel's service is in place.For nearly half a month, I left me a very good impression.Although I also lived in the hotel before, I lived in different room types. This time the comments are suitable for luxury rooms on the 17th floor."
1,酒店很新，离市中心也不错远，以这个价格在杭州住这样的房间，物超所值。不错！,"The hotel is very new, and it is also far from the city center. It is worthwhile to live in such a room in Hangzhou at this price.good!"
0,网路修了2个小时没修好，换房时告知没有房间，明明刚到的客人没有预定都能给商务大床房，怎么我们金卡会员反而没有？换了一间，没有窗户的，没给闷死。强烈要求换房，找来经理，态度很好，马上给换了有窗户的。前台的做法让人很失望。以前一直住这里，下次会改其他酒店。,"After two hours of repairing the Internet for 2 hours, I told that there was no room when changing the house. Obviously, the guests who had just arrived could give a large business bed room. Why did our gold card members not?After changing one, there were no windows, not dying.Strongly asked to change the house, I found the manager, and the attitude was very good. I immediately changed the window.The approach of the front desk is very disappointing.I used to live here, and I will change other hotels next time."
1,性价比高，服务挺好，有房可延迟退房，对于坐晚班飞机离港的游客是非常有利的．只是希望早餐收费可以和CTRIP一样，80元的自助餐还是有吸引力的．另，打的到广九东铁太贵，建议打到金钟坐地铁．,"The price is high, the service is very good, and there is a house to delay the check -out. It is very beneficial to tourists who leave the evening flight from Hong Kong.I just hope that breakfast charges can be like CTRIP, 80 yuan buffet is still attractive.In addition, it is too expensive to hit the Guangjiu East Railway. It is recommended to hit Jinzhong to take the subway."
0,"地点偏僻,比较难找到.出租车司机都不知道这个酒店的.早上的自主餐没有什么东西的,用餐环境就在一个走廊上,环境比较差.一张地图要10元钱.",The location is remote and it is difficult to find. The taxi driver does not know the hotel. There is nothing in the morning meals. The dining environment is in a corridor. The environment is relatively poor. A map costs 10 yuan.
1,装修后还不错，房间很干净，大床房很舒适。打印很贵,"After the renovation, the room is very clean, and the large bed room is very comfortable.Printing is expensive"
0,"2月10日刚刚住了,先定的2号楼的房间,进去一看吓了一跳!""号称挂牌四星,简直不敢想,就连招待所都不如!天花板的三角板吊顶是用胶带纸粘住的!赶紧加假换房,住了一号楼,还看的过去,大概相当于二星级!还有一点不满的是,房间里的毛巾特别破旧,跟招待所的毛巾有的一比!总之,我是不会再住了.","I just lived on February 10th. The first -fixed room of Building 2 was startled at a look at it! ""It is said that the listing four -star, I can't even think about it, even the hospitality is not as good as!Stick! Hurry up to change the house and live in the first building. It is probably equivalent to the two -star! There is also a little dissatisfaction. The towels in the room are particularly worn.In short, I won't live anymore."
1,很不错，前台彬彬有礼，房间干净整洁，出门就是客运中心，走到美食林和休闲场所都很方便。注意，听当地人说报国寺的美食林东西整整是峨嵋市里美食林的两倍，我们逛了逛，服务也怪怪的，就到对面峨眉山大酒店的仙林小厨和避风港分别解决了肚子问题，毕竟那里看起来正规些。整个峨嵋景区的管理还是很好的，明码标价，服务也不错，值得推荐。,"Very good, the front desk is polite, the room is clean and tidy, and it is the passenger transportation center. It is very convenient to walk to the food forest and leisure places.Note that the locals said that the food forests of the Pao Guo Temple were twice the food forest in Emei City. We went shopping and the service was weird.Belly, after all, it looks more formal.The management of the entire Emei Scenic Area is still very good, the price is clearly marked, the service is good, it is worth recommending."
0,这是在携程能找到的、汕尾最好的酒店。没办法,This is the best hotel in Shanwei that can be found in Ctrip.no way
0,"一个字,差啊,冷啊,暖气没有.空调太差!","One word, bad, cold, no heating. The air conditioner is too bad!"
1,本人是第一次去襄樊，记得那天到襄樊已经是10月3号凌晨三点多，我通过携程定的是10月3号的房，酒店不知道我这么早就到，当晚没有房间了，前台服务人员很热情，通过请示值班经理，后来将值班经理休息的房间腾出来给我住，也是一个大床间，房间很大。并且到4号凌晨退房，也没多收房价。房间里还有免费水果并且晚上回来床上还会放一朵玫瑰花，显得非常温馨。下次去襄樊我还会住那儿，因为性价比高，酒店能处处为客人着想。,"I was going to Xiangfan for the first time. I remember that I had arrived at Xiangfan at 3 am on October 3 that day. I set the room on October 3 through Ctrip.The service staff at the front desk was very enthusiastic. By asking the manager of the duty class, the room where the duty manager had rest was free to live for me. It was also a large bed with a large room.And check out in the early morning of the 4th, and did not collect more house prices.There are free fruits in the room and a rose will be placed on the bed at night, which looks very warm.Next time I go to Xiangfan, I will still live there, because the price is high, the hotel can think of guests everywhere."
1,"我是8月1日入住该酒店的,来香港主要为了SHOPPING,所以从地点来讲,酒店算是在较偏的位置,但觉得对得起我订的价格HKD550元/晚.房间很干净,而且我所入住的半海景房真的能看到很宽阔的海景,感觉很不错,卫生间很阔落,非常舒服.唯一欠缺的就是电视机,安置在床的侧面,看起来不是很方便,不过还好啦,反正不是为了看电视.交通方面,我没有遇到多大问题,只是那天来回上环,中环,酒店很多回,觉得酒店确是离购物点远了点.一般来说我从酒店出门就是看准它提供的SHUTTLEBUS的时间出发到港铁站(即中环站)转乘,回来则是搭到上环再转电车(俗称叮叮).因为沿路都有海景,感觉很是挺惬意的．对于订房我还有一点要补充：就是一定要提早定啊，我是一直在比价才选了８月１日出发（当然那几天还是动漫节则更一举两得），后来我接近８／１再查看时，价格已经变成１千多了，酒店是海鲜价因此深有体会．","I stayed at the hotel on August 1st. I came to Hong Kong for Shopping. From the point of view, the hotel is in a relatively biased position, but I feel that the price I ordered is HKD550 yuan/night. The room is very clean, and my officeThe semi -sea view room where you can see a very wide sea view can be seen. It feels very good. The bathroom is very wide and very comfortable. The only lack of lack is the TV, which is placed on the side of the bed.Anyway, it is not to watch TV. In terms of transportation, I have not encountered much problems, but I went back and forth that day to the ring, Central, and the hotel many times. I think the hotel is indeed far away from the shopping point. Generally speaking, I go out from the hotel to see it.The time it provides ShuttleBus is transferred to MTR Station (that is, Central Station), and when I come back, I will take it to Shanghai and then transfer to tram (commonly known as Ding Ding). Because there are sea views along the road, it feels very comfortable.I have to add one more to reservation: I must settle early. I have always chose to start on August 1st (of course, the Anime Festival is more than two birds). LaterAt this time, the price has become more than 1,000, and the hotel is a deep understanding."
1,房间比较大，就是马路噪音有点大，双层玻璃只要开一点点就受不了了。宽带1小时10块有点太黑了，这年头宽带还收费。以前也在西藏大厦住过，感觉前台服务比以前好些了。二楼的饭菜太一般了。整体还可以。,"The room is relatively large, that is, the noise of the road is a bit big, and the double -layer glass can not stand it.The broadband 1 hour is a bit too dark, and the broadband is still charging this year.I have also lived in the Tibet Building before, and I feel that the front desk service is better than before.The meal on the second floor is too average.Overall."
1,前台服务很好。我们去时，正好是退房高峰，大堂经理主动跑来帮我们处理。去乘电梯时，我们走错方向，她又追来提醒我们。用餐在底楼的自助餐，非常合算，88元午餐不含服务费。早饭在同一地方，也还好，用餐环境不错。就是咖啡机设置不合理，一杯咖啡是整整一大杯，量太大，而且没有留下空间加糖和奶。如果要浓缩咖啡，最好直接要服务员做给你。餐具很多是宜家的。,"The front desk service is very good.When we went, it happened to be the peak of check -out. The lobby manager took the initiative to help us handle it.When we went to the elevator, we went the wrong direction, and she chased us again.The buffet of dining on the bottom floor is very cost -effective. 88 yuan lunch does not include service fees.Breakfast is in the same place, it's okay, the dining environment is good.That is, the setting of the coffee machine is unreasonable. A cup of coffee is a large cup, which is too large, and there is no room for sugar and milk.If you want to condense coffee, it is best to make the waiter directly for you.Many tableware are IKEA."
1,洗了衣服本挂在洗手间的，等外出回来，已经拿架子挂在阳台上！满意服务态度一流，看到的全是笑脸！开心房间虽然设施老化，但很干净！安心海景不错！爽,"After washing the clothes, he hung on the bathroom. When he came back, he had already hanged on the balcony with a shelf!Satisfied service attitude is first -class, all you see is smiling!Although the room is aging, it is very clean!Good heart sea view is good!Cool"
0,酒店前台服务差，对待客人不热情。号称携程没有预定。感觉是客人在求他们，我们一定得住。这样的宾馆下次不会入住！,"The hotel's front desk service is poor, and it is not enthusiastic about treating guests.The claims to Ctrip are not reservations.It feels like the guests are asking them, we must live.Such a hotel will not stay next time!"
1,"住的是268的转角房.整个酒店的感觉还不错,在南阳已经不错了.可能是房间比较小的缘故,卫生间门不关的话,房间里会有一点气味.结帐的时候前台表示不能修改清单的内容,得去商务中心重新打印要花5块钱,这个比较不方便,其他酒店都可以免费改的.早餐很一般,不像4星级的.总的来说,还是推荐的.","I live in the corner room of 268. The whole hotel feels good. It is already good in Nanyang. It may be because the room is relatively small. If the bathroom door is not closed, there will be a little smell in the room.The content of the list, you have to go to the business center to print 5 yuan. This is inconvenient. Other hotels can be changed for free. Breakfast is very average, unlike 4 stars. In general, it is recommended."
1,总体感觉还不错。位置很中心，去商业区很方便。上次晚到还提供了升房。就是客房协调出了一些问题，升上去的一间房居然里面还有行李，可见内部沟通有问题。如果时间早还没问题，只是那时已经很晚，当事人总会有不舒服的地方,"feels pretty good in general.The location is very central, and it is convenient to go to the business district.Last night, I also provided a house lift.That is, the rooms have coordinated some problems, and a room that is raised in actually has luggage inside. It can be seen that there are problems with internal communication.If the time is not wrong, it is already late at that time, and the parties will always have uncomfortable places"
1,10月3日入住的该酒店，前台免费升级到了行政间，感觉酒店服务不错，不过旅游城市假日期间有点贵但比起杭州同星级的酒店价格还是有优势的！！以后还是会入住该酒店！,"The hotel where the hotel stayed on October 3rd was upgraded to the administrative room for free at the front desk. It feels that the hotel service is good, but it is a bit expensive during the holidays of the tourist city, but it is still advantageous than the price of the same star hotel in Hangzhou!IntersectionI will stay at the hotel in the future!"
1,西双版纳是个美丽的度假胜地，酒店就价格而言也物有所值，提供的早餐种类繁多且服务态度良好。我想借贵宝地提出一个建议，西双版纳的山林草木众多，植被繁茂，有少数民族居于山野，却不知火势猛于虎，常见他们将烟头之类随便丢弃于山林，更有甚者，我们在傣皇宫的猴山上看到当地的民俗表演中有一项是过节放高升，现在正是旱季，森林防火更是重中之重，若因疏于防范而酿成大祸，会给国家人民带来莫大的损失，望当地政府引以为鉴！,"Xishuangbanna is a beautiful resort. The hotel is also worthwhile in terms of price. There are many types of breakfast and good service attitude.I want to borrow a suggestion to make a suggestion. There are many forests and plants in Xishuangbanna, and the vegetation is lush. There are ethnic minorities living in the mountains, but they do not know that the fire is fierce than the tiger. It is often discarded the cigarette butt and the like.One of the local folk performances on the Monkey Mountain of the Palace is that the holidays have been high. Now it is the dry season. Forest fire prevention is even more important.The loss, hope the local government has learned!"
1,"因为要到那附近办事,只有定了这间酒店,,这次的服务明显比我上一次来的要好了.希望再接再励","Because I have to do anything nearby, I have only settled this hotel. This time, the service is obviously better than I came last time. I hope I will continue to encourage"
1,地点一流，房间设施比较陈旧，价格也越来越高了。好象携程的优势越来越不明显了。,"The location is first -rate, the room facilities are old, and the price is getting higher and higher.It seems that Ctrip's advantage is getting more and less obvious."
1,位置不错，在磁湖风景区，不巧湖北大雪，没有机会出去走走。交通稍稍不便，确实只是适合自驾车的客人，打车比较难，只能等送客过来的车，前台虽然帮助叫车，但是能叫到的机会不大。房间还不错，够得上四星标准，不过贵宾楼和主楼距离有点远，宾馆也没有安排接送什么的，雨雪天很麻烦，看来是服务还是不上档次呀！,"The location is good. In the Magnetic Lake Scenic Area, there is no chance to go out and walk around.Traffic is slightly inconvenient. It is really only suitable for self -driving guests. It is difficult to take a taxi. You can only wait for the car to send the guests. Although the front desk helps to call the car, the opportunity you can call is not great.The room is not bad. It is enough to go to the four -star standard, but the distance between the VIP and the main building is a bit far away. The hotel has not arranged a pick -up. It is very troublesome to rain and snow."
0,"此店是本人住过10余家北京如家中最贵的,所以我们满怀希望的过去.的确,进门就是很大气的大堂,但是也只有这点勉强能算优点.进入房间,不言而喻,是老酒店改的,完全没有如家应有的温馨感觉,设施陈旧并未完全翻新.最要命的来了,一只一圆硬币两倍大的蟑螂爬到我们同事的腿上,顿时,一个五大三粗的山东大汉被恶","This shop is the most expensive in the home in Beijing who has lived in more than 10 homes, so we are full of hope. Indeed, entering the door is a very atmospheric lobby, but only this can be regarded as an advantage.It was changed by the old hotel, and there was no warm feeling that the facilities should have. The old facilities were not completely refurbished. The most terrible one came. The cockroaches with twice the round coins climbed to our colleagues' legs.Shandong Dahan was evil"
1,酒店位置还不错，周围设施也比较方便，周围小吃还挺多，基本上来说是一个适合住宿的地方。缺点是门童不太好，基本上没有什么礼貌用语，也没有眼色帮客人拿行李或者叫出租车。,"The hotel location is not bad, the surrounding facilities are more convenient, and there are quite a lot of surrounding snacks. Basically, it is a place suitable for accommodation.The disadvantage is that the door children are not very good. Basically, there are no polite words, and they do not help guests take their luggage or taxi."
1,好非常好房间再大点就更好了送餐的服务员还不错,"It's very good, the room is better, it is better, the waiter for meals is not bad"
0,"位置比较怪,旁边是个菜市场,味道就...到达的时候下雨,所以前台有点混乱,等了10分钟左右,态度倒还好,房间蛮好,舒服.就是走廊的味道是我对这家店的印象降到底了,套","The location is relatively strange. There is a vegetable market next to it. The taste is raining when it arrives, so the front desk is a bit confusing. After waiting for about 10 minutes, the attitude is good, the room is pretty good, comfortable.The impression of the store has fallen to the end, set"
1,"很安静,无打扰,房间挺大,比较舒服,前如服务当然好了,热情得不得了,我看韩国文化气息很重,周围环境不错,走个十分钟去东山宾馆就可以到海边,但吃喝玩乐就比较远了,","Very quiet, no disturbance, the room is quite large, more comfortable.

1,这次住的是02号房间，卧室是单独的。电视在卧室里，餐厅客厅合一。这可能是真正的一房一厅。设施都比较新。但电视没有04号房间的大。我最喜欢的是卫生间。布局合理，干湿分开。下次还会住,"This time I lived in Room 02, and the bedroom was separate.The TV is in the bedroom, and the restaurant living room is united.This may be the real one -bedroom and one hall.The facilities are relatively new.But TV is not as big as room 04.My favorite is the bathroom.The layout is reasonable and the wet and wet is separated.I will live next time"
0,2月11日入住下午2点前到达的，我与友人共四人，预定了两间大床房，到达时，前台共有4位服务员，在我们之前有一位服务员在帮一个一家三口办理checkin，其余三位服务员呆立旁边，我对她们说能否帮我办理checkin，答曰：等待。这种办事方式已让我非常不爽，终于办完checkin后，服务员把房卡交给了门童，门童无视我们地上9个大包，拿着卡就往里冲，我们当场滴汗，将门童唤回，才心不甘情不愿的帮我们拿了两个包。房间在3号楼三楼到底的两间，此楼非常安静，安静的让人毛骨悚然，楼很旧，周边有一废弃的工厂。房门是绿色的木板门，到底的那间房门感应是坏的，直接用钥匙的。房间很大，很空旷，电视很模糊，卫生间很小，是淋浴房，设施很简陋，与前台服务员标榜的四星酒店相去甚远。总之，这个酒店的第一印象就给我们非常不好不舒服，但是，接下来发生的事就更让人崩溃了。打开水龙头，流出来的水很黄很脏，两间房都是如此，致电前台，前台让我们致电客房部，于是再致电客房部，答曰：上午刚冲洗了水箱，把水龙头开十分钟不要关，过一会会好的。于是我们开了足足二十分钟，依然不见好转，再次致电客房部询问怎么回事，客房部说把水龙头关掉吧，现在太多客人都把龙头开着，水一直在流动，沉淀物沉淀不下来了，我问什么时候才会好，她说过两个小时会好的。于是我们就关了水龙头出门逛鼓浪屿去了，3点半出门的。晚上7点多我们回了酒店，打开龙头，水依然是黄色的，致电前台，前台说她们前台那边的水也是黄色的，不知道什么时候会好，让我致电客房部。致电客房部，客房部说工程队在抢修了，说是水管坏了，我问那么什么时候才能修好？对方直接挂断了我的电话，本来就已经非常不爽了，不能洗手，不能烧水，而且前台和客房部接电话的都态度十分不耐烦，现在还挂我电话，顿时偶就火大了，又一个电话打回客房部，质问为什么挂我电话，对方竟然百般抵赖，问她到底什么时候能修好能用水，对我说她现在去问工程部，稍后就给我回音。于是我又开始了漫长的等待，一刻钟后依然没有回复，此时我们已对酒店感到非常的失望，对他们的服务感到非常的不满，我便致电了携程，将大致经过向携程述说了一遍，希望携程能致电该酒店进行调和，谁知接线小姐竟然对我说，您应该与酒店进行联系，我不明白是接线小姐没有听清我的话，还是只是在照本宣科，我已经和你清楚的说了与酒店交涉了许多次，对方始终在各部门推卸责任，整整一天都没有修好水管，最后，我对接线小姐阐明了携程、鼓浪别墅酒店以及客户三者间的利害关系以及责任关系，那位小姐终于明白事理，对我说会致电酒店让他们联系我给我一个答复。几分钟后，携程致电给我说已与酒店取得联系，稍后酒店会联系我。又是十分钟的等待，酒店没有任何人联系过我们，于是我再次致电携程，当然换了一位接线小姐，当然还是少不了利害关系及责任关系的教育，小姐也对我说会致电酒店让他们联系我给我一个答复。几分钟后，携程再次致电我，让我等待酒店联系。数分钟后，前台打来电话，和我说水管在抢修中，马上就会修好了，我问那么大概还要多久，我马上要出去吃饭了，回来后能修好吗？对方说肯定能修好，我说那万一修不好呢？对方说没有万一的，我说不可能的，万一没修好怎么办？对方终于说万一没修好那就给你们换房，我说记住你说的话哦。然后我们就出门吃饭了。在吃饭的时候正巧遇上一个酒店的游客，我问他们水能不能用，他们说水很好没问题啊，我问他们是几号楼的，他们说2号楼。两小时后回到酒店，打开龙头，冷水已经恢复正常，但是热水依然是黄水，并且时不时出现断水现象，致电前台，找到那位前面与我通话的小姐，要求换房，那个小姐说人家的水都好了亚，为什么你们的还是黄水啊？感觉好像我们在欺骗她一样的，我说那你自己过来看，然后她就说要去查一下有什么房间，我说你们2号楼的水是好的吧，她说1号楼2号楼都是好的。那么言下之意就是就我们3号楼的水不好咯，而且上午就开始不好，明知水质有问题还安排我们入住，真是忒过分了！！！过了一会她打来说2号楼有个两室一厅的套房，问我要吗，我说是什么样的床，她说一个大床，一个单人床，我说那你叫我们四个人怎么睡啊，她说那她再去查查有什么房间。又过了一会她打来说一号楼有个海景标房，二号楼还有个一室一厅的小套房，明明有房间，就想蒙我们，我说我要看房间。然后我们就到了前台，到了前台，她有开始质疑我们的水质，总觉得我们在没事找事，拜托，都已经11点，第二天还要赶飞机，你不想睡我们还想睡觉来！！！真是忒过分了这个服务质量！！！让她去房间自己检验又不肯。终于，最后那两间房还算正常，虽然设施依然不能用四星来衡量，上海的二星估计都比它好，最后总结鼓浪别墅酒店，酒店非常老，设施陈旧，环境阴森，服务态度极其恶劣的差，办事效率极其低，非常崩溃！！！补充点评2008年2月25日：忘记说了，那两间大床房还号称是豪华房,"I arrived before 2 pm on February 11. I had four people and my friends and scheduled two large beds. When they arrived, there were 4 waiters at the front desk. Before we, a waiter helped to checkin for one family of three.The remaining three waiters stood next to them. I said to them whether they could help me check up checkin and answer: Wait.This way of doing things has made me very uncomfortable. After finishing checking, the waiter handed the room card to Men Tong. The door boy ignored the 9 large bags on the ground and rushed in the card.Tong recalled that he was unwilling to help us get two bags.The room is on the third floor of Building 3. This building is very quiet, quiet and creepy. The building is very old. There is an abandoned factory around.The door is a green wooden door. In the end, the door of the room is bad, and the key is directly.The room is very large, very empty, the TV is very vague, the bathroom is small, it is a shower room, the facilities are very simple, and it is far from the four -star hotel advertised by the front desk.In short, the first impression of this hotel gives us very uncomfortable, but what happened next made people even more collapsed.Open the faucet, the water flowing out is very yellow and dirty. Both rooms are the same. Call the front desk. The front desk allows us to call the guest room department, so I called the guest room department and answered: I just rinsed the water tank in the morning.Guan, it will be good after a while.So we drove for 20 minutes, and we still didn't improve. I called the guest room department again to ask about what was going on. The room department said that the faucet was turned off.If you don't come down, I will ask when it will be fine. She said it will be fine for two hours.So we closed the faucet and went out to go to the Cuangyuyu, and went out at 3:30.At 7 o'clock in the evening, we returned to the hotel and opened the faucet. The water was still yellow. Call the front desk. The front desk said that the water on the front side of the front desk is also yellow. I don't know when it will be good. Let me call the guest room department.Call the guest room department. The room department said that the engineering team was repairing it, saying that the water pipe was broken. I asked when to repair it?The other party directly hung up my phone. It was already very unhappy. I couldn't wash my hands or burn water. The front desk and the guest room department were very impatient. I still hung me up.Another phone call back to the guest room department and asked why he hung up on the phone, and the other party relied in all ways to ask her when she could repair and use water. She told me that she would ask the engineering department now, and then replied to me later.So I started a long wait, and I still didn't reply after a minute. At this time, we were very disappointed with the hotel and very dissatisfied with their services. I called Ctrip.I hope that Ctrip can call the hotel to reconcile. Who knows that the wiring lady said to me, you should contact the hotel. I don’t understand whether the wiring lady did not hear me.After negotiating with the hotel many times, the other party has always shown responsibility in various departments, and has not repaired the water pipe for a whole day. Finally, I clarify the interested relationship and responsibility relationship between Ctrip, Guluo Villa Hotel and customers.Ms. Qi finally understood the matter, and told me that he would call the hotel to ask them to contact me to give me a reply.A few minutes later, Ctrip called me that I had contacted the hotel, and the hotel would contact me later.It was a ten -minute wait. No one had contacted us in the hotel, so I called Ctrip again. Of course, after changing a wiring lady, of course, there is still an education that is indispensable.Contact me with a reply.A few minutes later, Ctrip called me again and asked me to wait for the hotel to contact.A few minutes later, the front desk called and told me that the water pipe would be repaired immediately. I asked how long it would take for so long. I was going to go out for dinner. Can I repair it after I come back?The other party said that it can be repaired. What should I say if it is not good?The other party said that there was no case, I said it was impossible. What if I didn't repair it?The other party finally said that if I didn't repair it, I would change the house for you, and I said to remember what you said.Then we went out for dinner.When I was eating, I happened to meet a hotel tourists. I asked them if they could use water. They said that the water was good. I asked them that they were from Building No. 2.Two hours later, I returned to the hotel and opened the faucet. The cold water has returned to normal, but the hot water is still yellow water, and the phenomenon of water break from time to time appears. Call the front desk and find the lady who talks to me in front of me.The water is good, why are you still Huangshui?It feels like we are deceiving her. I said that you came to see it yourself, and then she said that I would check what room. I said that the water in Building No. 2 is good. She saidIt's all good.Then the implication is that the water in our Building 3 is not good, and the morning is not good. Knowing that there is a problem with the quality of the water, we are arranged for us to stay. It is really too much!IntersectionIntersectionAfter a while, she said that there was a two -bedroom and one -living house in Building 2. Do you ask me what kind of bed? She said a big bed, a single bed, I said you call usHow can four people sleep, she said she went to check what room.After a while, she said that there was a sea -view room in Building 1, and there was a small suite with one room and a living room on Building 2. Obviously there was a room, so I wanted to cover us. I said that I want to see the room.Then we arrived at the front desk. At the front desk, she began to question our water quality. I always felt that we were nothing to find. Please, it was 11 o'clock, and the next day we had to catch the plane. You do n’t want to sleep. We do n’t want to sleep!IntersectionIntersectionIt's really too much of this service quality!IntersectionIntersectionLet her go to the room to test and refuse to.Finally, the last two rooms were normal. Although the facilities still could not be measured by four -star, the two stars in Shanghai are estimated to be better than it. Finally, the Guluo Villa Hotel is very old, the facilities are old, the environment is gloomy, the service attitude is extremely attitude.The bad difference, the efficiency is extremely low, and it is very collapsed!IntersectionIntersectionSupplementary comment on February 25, 2008: Forgot to say, those two large beds are also known as luxury rooms"
0,感不太像酒店，像旅。。。毛巾什麽的都比,"I don't feel like a hotel, like a brigade.EssenceEssenceTowels are more than"
0,看照片觉得还挺不错的，又是4星级的，但入住以后除了后悔没有别的，房间挺大但空空的，早餐是有但没有可以吃的东东，环境是好但天气太冷，总之我以后不会再住那里。,"I feel pretty good to see the photos, and it is 4 -star, but after staying, I regret nothing but the room is quite large but empty. The breakfast is something that can be eaten. The environment is good but the weather is too cold. The weather is too cold.In short, I won't live there in the future."
0,之前和你们电话反映了，2个问题。1，不接受携程客户用信用卡。你们和酒店负责人确认后，给我的回答是pos机坏了，所有卡不能用，其实根本不是：她们亲口跟我说了多次，因为携程预定的所以不能用，退房结帐时，亲眼看见别人用卡支付。而且，在我退房时，又有新来的2人由于携程预定被拒绝用卡预授权。难道你们宁愿被人骗么，或者和酒店有勾结，不相信你们客户反映的问题？这样，携程会倒闭的。2，结帐时，由于携程客户，不能提供消费明细，发票没有问题。最终临时做了一个给我们。他们解释，由于给携程报帐什么的原因，不能提供。你们之间有什么交易我不管，但不要影响我公司报效要求明细呀。不解决这些问题，很难用携程网了。请重视。,"I reported with you before, 2 questions.1. Do not accept Ctrip customer credit card.After you confirmed that the person in charge of the hotel, the answer to me was that the POS machine was broken, and all cards could not be used. In fact, they were not told me many times because of Ctrip's scheduled.See others with cards to pay with cards.Moreover, when I got out of the room, two new people were pre -authorized by Ctrip to be rejected by Ctrip.Do you would rather be cheated, or collude with the hotel, do n’t believe in the issues that your customers reflected?In this way, Ctrip will fail.2. During the checkout, because Ctrip customers cannot provide consumption details, there is no problem with the invoice.Eventually, I made a temporary to us.They explained that due to the reasons for reporting to Ctrip, they could not be provided.I don't care about any transactions between you, but don't affect the details of our company's reporting requirements.It is difficult to use Ctrip.com without solving these problems.Please pay attention."
1,酒店的硬件不错，房间相当新，大堂有气派，招待国外客人很合适，虽然位置离市中心远了一点。假如前台的服务态度多一点热诚会更理想。,"The hotel's hardware is good, the room is quite new, the lobby is full of energy, and it is very suitable for foreign guests to entertain foreign guests, although the location is a bit far from the city center.If the service attitude of the front desk is more enthusiastic, it will be more ideal."
0,旁楼的房间千万不能住，房间太差，洗手间居然发现蟑螂，价格也不便宜，很不爽，主楼的房间到还可以,"The rooms in the side building must not live, the room is too bad, the toilet actually finds cockroaches, the price is not cheap, very uncomfortable, the room in the main building is okay"
1,"很好..一如既往的好.除了贵点.地段和服务都是一流的.第一天我只是睡前喝了口水而已,第二天就发现新送来的矿泉水放到了床头--本来是放在桌子上的补充点评2008年4月18日：对了,酒店的下午茶,强烈推荐,小点心好吃得紧.居然有我爱吃的冷火腿做配菜的小饼干,太意外了.似乎是360+15%/2人?","Very good .. As always good. Except for the expensive, the location and the service are first-class. On the first day, I just drank saliva before going to bed. The next day I found that the newly sent mineral water was placed on the bedside-originallyIt is a supplementary comment on the table April 18, 2008: By the way, the afternoon tea of the hotel is strongly recommended, the small dim sum is delicious. There is actually a small biscuits I like to eat with side dishes.Is it 360+15%/2 people?"
1,"大堂显得太小,服务周到细致,我下次一定会在入住.",The lobby looks too small and the service is thoughtful and meticulous. I will definitely stay in next time.
0,定了两间一样的房，一间有宽带，一间没有？为什么？有宽带的一间，上网有时能上，有时上不了，急死活人！卫生间房顶漏水，房间里没有任何饮料，问服务员要饮料，回答必须现金结账，不可以挂房帐，岂有此理？,"There are two same rooms, one with broadband, one?Why?There is a broadband, sometimes I can go online, sometimes I ca n’t get on, and I am anxious to die!The bathroom roof is leaking, and there is no drink in the room. Ask the waiter to drink, answer the cash checkout, you can't hang the house, how can this be?"
0,很失望，不知道那四颗星是怎么得来的。住的单人标间，328，房间很小。一直有流水的声音，可能是暖气?隔音也很差，我房间隔壁是服务生房间，一大早就开始活动，分配工作什么的，吵醒我，再也没机会睡着。房间的小冰箱里只有可乐，晚上想喝啤酒的要注意了，自己带。早餐种类不少，就是餐厅太冷了，因为我去晚了？早餐也都凉了。,"I was disappointed, I don't know how the four stars came.The single -person standard room, 328, the room is very small.There has always been a sound of flowing water. Maybe it is heating? The sound insulation is also very poor. My room is the waiter's room next to it. I started activities early in the morning.There is only cola in the small refrigerator in the room. If you want to drink beer at night, you must pay attention.There are many types of breakfast, that is, the restaurant is too cold, because I am late?Breakfast is also cold."
1,房间非常好，水也不像网上说的忽冷忽热。总体感觉很舒服。早餐非常丰盛。,"The room is very good, and the water is not as cold and hot as said on the Internet.It feels very comfortable overall.Breakfast is very rich."
1,我是帮两位外国客人定的江景房。客人的回馈还是不错的。我看了其他客人有的评点不是很好，可能还是江景房比较能保证质量。,I am a Jiangjing room set by two foreign guests.The feedback of the guests is still good.I read that some of the other guests are not very good. It may be that Jiangjingfang can ensure the quality.
0,"强烈不推荐靠马路的房间特别是单人间,因为整个房间除了凌晨1点到5点是稍安静的以外其他时间都是在刺耳的噪音中.虽然挂5星却有2星的房间和最差的服务.以后再不会入住.","It is strongly not recommended that the rooms that rely on the road, especially the single room, because the entire room except 1 to 5 am is a slightly quieter in other times in the harsh noise. Although it is hung 5 stars, there are 2 stars and the worst room and worst.Services. I won't stay in the future."
1,2楼的标准间非常非常好，房间很大，床很舒服，隔音也不错，空调足够暖，卫生间尤其棒，非但大而且浴缸是个木桶，泡了半个小时舒服极了。但是温泉性价比不高，池子比较少，游泳池的水也太冷了。倒是那个室外的，虽然不大，但是我去的那天正好下着雪，所以感觉很好。早餐一般，倒是一楼的中餐厅的东西不错，价格不贵味道却很好，量也比较足。,"The standard room on the second floor is very, very good, the room is very large, the bed is very comfortable, the sound insulation is good, the air conditioner is warm enough, the bathroom is particularly good, not only large but also a wooden barrel, soaked for half an hour.However, the hot spring is not cost -effective, the pool is relatively small, and the water in the swimming pool is too cold.It was that outdoor. Although it was not big, the day when I went, it was snowing, so it felt good.Breakfast is average, but the Chinese restaurant on the first floor is good, the price is not expensive, but the amount is very good, and the amount is sufficient."
1,我十一期间入住到瑞和园，先把最坏的缺点透露给驴友（免得还没看到最后就翻页了）：隔音效果极差！每间房窗外都是走廊，而且木制结构的房屋稍有动静就整个楼都在响！遇到没素质的客人，他们就在走廊大呼小叫不亦乐乎！服务员劝导多次也无济于事！或是半夜古城大部分商户关门，客人才回来，叮叮咣咣的上楼，关门，洗澡声吵的你必须等到别人可能都睡了才能入睡。一旦你先睡，半夜必被吵醒！半夜没被吵醒，第二天也会有起的早的人像千军万马一样冲出房门把你吵醒！！！在外旅游身体多有不适和变化，休息极为关键，正样才能保证第二天精神饱满而愉快的出行，反正我住了4天，天天都被吵的头疼！！！去之前以为那里很大，其实不然，就是主人自家的房子，用做宾馆就显的很小了（听服务员说瑞和园正在别处盖新房）。进入屋内不久，服务员就热情的送上一盘小点心和一壶开水，很是贴心～若是有饮水机就更好了！屋内不大但很干净，厕所有淋浴房显得上了层档次，但是洗澡时总调不到适宜的温度。。。。。。白天大家都出去玩，院子里倒是安静，行程安排不满的驴友可以静静的坐在院里，碰上老外还可以练练外语～～祝大家玩的开心吧：）,"I stayed at Ruihe Park during the eleven period, and first disclosed the worst shortcomings to donkeys (I don't have to see the page before I saw it): The sound insulation effect is very poor!Each room window is a corridor, and the wooden structure of the house is slightly moved and the whole building is rang!When they encountered no quality guests, they shouted at the corridor!The waiter persuaded many times to help!Or in the middle of the night, most merchants in the ancient city closed, the guests returned, Ding Ding's upstairs, closed the door, and you had to wait until others might fall asleep to fall asleep.Once you sleep first, you will be awakened in the middle of the night!I was not awakened in the middle of the night, and the early people who would have the early days will rush out of the door like thousands of horses to wake you up!IntersectionIntersectionThere are many discomforts and changes in traveling outside, and the rest is extremely critical. Only can you ensure that the spirit is full and happy the next day. Anyway, I lived for 4 days, and I was noisy every day!IntersectionIntersectionBefore going, I thought it was very big. In fact, it was not, it was the owner's own house, and it was very small to use it as a hotel (listening to the waiter that Ruihe Garden was building a new house elsewhere).Shortly after entering the house, the waiter sent a plate of snacks and a pot of water enthusiastically. It was very intimate ~ It would be better if there was a water dispenser!The house is not large but very clean. The shower room of the toilet looks like a layer, but the total temperature is not appropriate when bathing.EssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEveryone goes out during the day. The yard is quiet. The dissatisfaction of the schedule can sit quietly in the courtyard. When you encounter foreigners, you can also practice foreign languages ~~ I wish you all a happy play :)"
1,比较旧了，但整体感觉还行。服务也还可以。,"It's old, but the overall feeling is okay.The service is okay."
1,总的来说还不错，在漳州地区属于较有档次的酒店了。地理位置也好，对面有海鲜排档。说个不足：早餐的服务不好，六个服务员只有两个干活，其余在聊天，声音很大。希望改进！,"In general, it is not bad. It is a more grade hotel in the Zhangzhou area.There is a geographical location, and there are seafood stalls opposite.Said: Breakfast service is not good. There are only two waiters in the six waiters. The rest are chatting, and the sound is loud.Hope to improve!"
0,位置比较好卫生条件也还行就是房间太小高级大床房的大床还不如一般酒店的标间的床而且床实在是睡的不是很舒服,"The good location is better, and the large bed in the room is too small in the high -end bedroom."
1,酒店确实不错。出行也方便。自助晚餐没有去吃，不知道如何。早餐就餐环境不错，但是有人在里边吸烟，不爽。服务员不热情，没有主动提供热饮，比如茶或咖啡等等。住的A，不知道其他两栋怎么样。房间舒服，但是宽带似乎不太好用，经常莫名其妙断线。下次还会入住。补充点评2008年7月8日：哦，对了，值得一提的是，１５％的服务费问题。我那天去得比较晚，２点过没吃午餐，就去了２楼的西餐厅，吃了一个咖喱牛肉饭，很不好吃。牛肉我基本没动，老，而且没味道，相信收盘子的人看到了。咖喱汁也稀稀的，不成功。耗时３０多分钟，里边的土豆并没有很熟。希望改进。１５％的服务费，得有服务，如果借鉴国外的做法，再结帐单上，有一栏小费，如果客人觉得好，就写上一个数字，奖励给酒店，比这种强行收取来的好。所以这里要扣分。,"The hotel is really good.It is also convenient to travel.I did n’t eat the buffet dinner, I do n’t know what.The meal environment is good for breakfast, but some people smoke inside, unhappy.The waiter is not enthusiastic and does not actively provide hot drinks, such as tea or coffee.Living A, I don't know how the other two buildings are.The room is comfortable, but the broadband seems not easy to use, and it is often inexplicable.I will stay in the next time.Supplementary review July 8, 2008: Oh, by the way, it is worth mentioning that 15 % of service fees.I went late that day. I didn't have lunch at 2 o'clock. I went to the western restaurant on the second floor and ate a curry beef rice. It was not delicious.I basically didn't move beef, old, and tasteless.The curry sauce is also sparse and unsuccessful.It took more than 30 minutes, and the potatoes inside were not very familiar.Hope to improve.15 % of the service fee must have services. If you learn from foreign practices, there will be a tip of the bill on the bill. If the guests feel good, write a number and reward the hotel, which is better than this forcibly charged.So you need to deduct points here."
1,酒店的园林很漂亮，中式园林很大，只是没人保养，都是蛛网，唉，5星酒店啊，怎么管理的。酒店有很大的室内游泳池，还有儿童池，训练池，排场不错，想必维持费用也很高。酒店大堂里有很多石雕，很漂亮。标房房间够大，够5星。服务员也是微笑服务，但总感觉不自然，5星的标准还要加强培训啊。早餐总类不是很多，单够一般的选择了。酒店位置到镇上步行15分钟，稍微偏了点。总体印象不错。,"The hotel's garden is very beautiful, and the Chinese gardens are very large, but no one is maintained, it is a cobweb, alas, 5 star hotels, how to manage it.The hotel has a large indoor swimming pool, as well as children's pools, training pools, and good row, presumably the cost is also very high.There are many stone carvings in the hotel lobby, which is very beautiful.The benchmark room is large enough to 5 stars.The waiter is also a smile service, but it always feels unnatural, and the standard of 5 stars must be strengthened.There are not many breakfast categories.The hotel was walking for 15 minutes in the town, and it was a little bit tilted.The overall impression is good."
1,"酒店环境不错,但离森林国家公园需步行20分钟,稍远.补充","The hotel environment is good, but it takes 20 minutes to walk from the Forest National Park, slightly far."
0,确实不太像三星的，不知道信阳其他三星酒店怎么样。补充点评2008年3月13日：家具比较老旧，不太喜欢，而且空调也不太好。,"It really doesn't look like Samsung. I don't know how to do other Samsung hotels in Xinyang.Supplementary comment on March 13, 2008: The furniture is old, I don't like it, and the air conditioner is not very good."
1,这家酒店总体感觉不错，房间挺大的，酒店位置也好，就是服务员反应比较慢。。。。。。，态度还行，就是能不能解决，什么时间能解决，总应该有个明确的答复吧，无语！！！,"This hotel is generally good, the room is quite large, and the hotel location is better, that is, the waiter responds slowly.EssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceThe attitude is okay, whether it can be solved, when can it be solved, there should always be a clear answer, speechless!IntersectionIntersection"
0,"入住单人大床标准间:给人感觉很陈旧,浴室的门漆都掉了;毛巾是很破的,虽然没用,但觉得真是少见啊;晚上入住还看不太出来,白天的时候发现原来地毯也是很脏;晚上从十点多开始到半夜两三点,过道不时有喧闹声打闹声,个人猜想是入住隔壁的游客,更过分的是还有人撒酒疯乱敲房门,而酒店居然没有人来制止,直到我们打电话联系总台.","Standard room in the single -player bed: It feels very old, and the door paint of the bathroom has dropped; the towels are very broken. Although it is useless, it is really rare; I don’t see it at night.It turns out that the carpet is also very dirty; from ten o'clock in the evening to two or three o'clock in the middle of the night, there are noisy sounds from time to time. I guessed that they were staying at the next door.No one came to stop the hotel until we called the head station."
1,五星级酒店肯定是各方面都很好的，下次还要预定这里,Five -star hotels must be very good in all aspects. I have to book here next time
1,8月份在赛格尔住了几天，住过208元的商务间和238元的豪华单人间，感觉如下：优点：1、地理位置很好，走路至解放碑不到5分钟；2、服务较好，换房服务及时，可以延到下午2点退房；3、房间面积很大（在拐角的商务间面积相比要小些）。缺点：1、房间装修一般，木地板，虽然面积不小，但让人感觉装修品位很差；另外电视相比房间面积太小，躺在床上看电视看不清楚；2、总共有33层楼，却只有4部电梯，等电梯时间太长；3、酒店7楼餐厅饭菜种类较少，味道一般，还不提供送餐服务；4、卫生间很小，淋浴的喷头很差，洗澡不舒服；5、房间吧台小吃价格比其他酒店偏贵，洗衣费也偏贵（相比解放碑附近我住过的其他酒店）。总体来说这家酒店一般，不过从房价和地理位置综合考虑，我给它打3.5分。,"I lived in Siegel for a few days in August. I lived in a business room of 208 yuan and a luxurious single room of 238 yuan. It feels as follows: advantages: 1. The geographical location is good, walking until the liberated monument for less than 5 minutes;It is better, and the house changing service can be extended in a timely manner to check out at 2 pm;Disadvantages: 1. The decoration of the room, the wooden floor, although the area is not small, it makes people feel that the decoration is very poor; in addition, the TV area is too small than the room, and it is not clear to watch the TV on the bed. 2. There are 33 floors in total.There are only 4 elevators, and the time for the elevator is too long; 3. The types of restaurants on the 7th floor of the hotel are small and the taste is average, and the food delivery service is not provided.5. The price of snacks in the room bar is more expensive than other hotels, and the laundry fee is also expensive (compared to other hotels I have lived near Jiefangbei).Generally speaking, this hotel is average, but from comprehensive consideration of house prices and geographical location, I scored 3.5 points."
0,先说优点：装修是新的，房间很大，房间灯光、家具都不错，达到3星水平。山庄所处位置风景优美，整体布局设计体现了一定的水平。再说缺点：管理水平跟农村招待所差不多。一大早空调就没电了，原来是服务员在外面关了房间的开关，打电话之后服务员才把开关打开。早上9点不到，有客人退房，服务员持对讲机在楼道里用能吵醒整个楼层任何甜梦的声音在跟前台对讲，把整个山庄最可贵的宁静搅扰得荡然无存。最后是最要命的：温泉的水根本看不出是温泉，脏的简直就是山脚下湖里头抽上来的湖水。虽说可以随时调温，可是任你泡你看着那一池你专用的浑浊的温泉水，谅你也不敢泡久！宾馆反馈2006年12月29日：感谢您选择颐和温泉度假山庄，享受美好的假期。我们很重视您提的宝贵意见，同时做了相应的调查。关于房间空调电源一事是由于当天早上有一位客人在温泉区泡温泉的时候将路边的灯泡不小心打烂，造成电路湿水而自动断电保护的，这也是对客人安全的一个保障。酒店客房区内采用现代最新的电路技术，由电房总控制，所以在酒店房间及门口是没有电源开关设施的。酒店是不会，而且不允许任何人，在正常情况下关闭已有客人入住的房间的所有设施。颐和温泉度假山庄的温泉是属于极热型的氡温泉，氡温泉为无味，颜色相对淡黄，为了更好的配合按摩效果，我们在每个温泉池都采用浅棕色，浅黄色等的鹅卵石为铺垫，故此经过光线的折射会给客人“不干净”的错觉。您可以放心的使用，体会温泉带来的美好享受。服务员不正确使用对讲机的行为属于个别偶尔现象，当然，也是我们管理的一个疏忽，就该事情，我们已经对其进行相关教育。再次感谢您对我们提出的宝贵意见和建议，我们会努力改进每一个细节，让大家度过一个美好而难忘的假期。,"First, the advantages: the decoration is new, the room is large, the room lights and furniture are good, reaching a 3 -star level.The location of the villa is beautiful, and the overall layout design reflects a certain level.Besides the disadvantage: management level is similar to the rural guest house.Early in the morning, the air conditioner was out of power. It turned out that the waiter turned out the switch of the room outside. After calling, the waiter turned on the switch.Within 9 o'clock in the morning, there were guests checking out. The waiter held a walkway in the corridor to wake up any sweet dream of the entire floor in the front desk to talk to the front desk, and disturbing the most precious tranquility of the entire villa.In the end, the most terrible: the water of the hot spring does not see the hot spring at all, and the dirty is simply the lake pumped from the lake at the foot of the mountain.Although you can adjust the temperature at any time, you can soak you, watch the turbid hot spring water you dedicated to that pool, you dare not soak for a long time!Hotel feedback on December 29, 2006: Thank you for choosing Yixi Hot Spring Resort Villa to enjoy a beautiful holiday.We attach great importance to your precious opinions and make corresponding investigations at the same time.Regarding the room air -conditioning power supply, it was due to a guest who accidentally smashed the light bulbs on the roadside during the hot spring in the hot spring in the hot spring area, causing the circuit to automatically power off the electric water, which is also a guarantee for the safety of the guests.The latest modern circuit technology in the hotel room area is controlled by the total electric room, so there is no power switching facility in the hotel room and door.The hotel is not, and no one is allowed to close all the facilities in the room where the existing guests staying in the room.The hot springs of the Yihe Hot Spring Resort are extremely hot hot springs. The hot spring is tasteless and the color is relatively pale yellow. In order to better cooperate with the massage effect, we use light brown, light yellow and other cobblestone in each hot spring pool.To pave the way, the illustration of the light will give guests the illusion of ""unclean"".You can use it safely to experience the beautiful enjoyment brought by the hot spring.The behavior of the incorrect use of the intriguing of the waiter is an occasional phenomenon. Of course, it is also a negligence we managed. As far as we have, we have conducted related education.Thank you again for your valuable opinions and suggestions. We will strive to improve every detail and let everyone have a beautiful and unforgettable holiday."
1,"酒店的环境很不错,空气也好,房间的设施总体还行,就是卫生间在楼下,半夜起来上厕所实在不方便要走到楼下.酒店比较远一定要有自驾车才能进去.","The environment of the hotel is very good, the air is good, and the facilities in the room are generally okay, that is, the bathroom is downstairs, and it is not convenient to go to the toilet in the middle of the night. It is really inconvenient to go downstairs. The hotel must have a self -driving car to enter."
1,"名不副实,说是""准5星"",充其量准4星.基本设施(家具,洁具,电器)陈旧,而且落后,大概90年代中期水平.毛巾黑且硬.","The name is not true, and it is said to be ""quasi -5 stars"", and the amount of 4 stars at best. Basic facilities (furniture, sanitary ware, electrical appliances) are old, and they are backward."
0,简单的家具，墙上的颜色非常漂亮，设施还可以说不陈旧，但是房间里总有一股烟味以及油漆味。并且楼顶是个培训学校，晚上还有上课铃声。并且还蛮吵。在那个地方能有这个价格，确实便宜。,"Simple furniture, the color of the wall is very beautiful, and the facilities can be said to be not old, but there is always a smoke and paint flavor in the room.And the top of the building is a training school, and there are also ringtones at night.And quite noisy.It can be cheap in that price."

0,"先说好的:地段在闹市区中心,房间也还可以,价格比较便宜,含在188房价里的早餐也可以.不好的:门口是单行道,不知道怎么开车进去,最后逆向行驶进去了,有个警察拿着摄象机在拍,不知道有没有中彩.停车的地方很少,对停车的客人总台和保安的态度很差,朝大街的房间很吵,对面商场的大喇叭太刺耳,卫生间洗澡水很难调,淋浴四周就一个半拉浴帘遮挡,一洗澡卫生间里都是水.","Let's talk about it first: The location is in the center of the downtown area, and the room is okay. The price is cheaper. Breakfast containing in 188 house prices is also possible. Not good: The door is a single road, I don’t know how to drive in, I don’t know how to drive in. I don’t know how to drive in.There is a police officer holding the camera to shoot. I do n’t know if there are any Chinese lottery. There are very few places for parking.

1,刚从三亚回来，在寰岛住了一个晚上，房间刚进去因为是阴面的关系，有点霉味。但是相对于亚龙湾其他酒店的价格来说，还是很具有性价比的！宾馆的服务很好，门口的门迎每次见我们都给我们问好，并把行李一直送到房间里面。酒店离海边很近，走路也就是两分钟。旁边就是亚龙湾海底世界的入口，住在这里方便一些觉得亚龙湾吃东西很贵的人，因为酒店门口西临有个员工餐厅，一份饭也就6元，还不错！比起其他地方动辄几百元的餐费还是很划算的！总体来说寰岛是亚龙湾最具有性价比的酒店了！,"I just returned from Sanya and lived for one night in Huandao. The room had just entered because it was a shade, a little moldy.But compared to the price of other hotels in Yalong Bay, it is still very cost -effective!The hotel's service was very good. Every time the door was greeted, we asked us well and sent our luggage to the room.The hotel is very close to the beach, walking for two minutes.Next to the entrance to the Underwater World of the Yalong Bay, living here is convenient for those who think Yalong Bay is very expensive, because there is an employee restaurant at the west of the hotel, a meal is 6 yuan, which is not bad!It is still cost -effective than the meal costs of hundreds of dollars in other places!In general, Huanfan is the most cost -effective hotel in Yalong Bay!"
1,总体感觉还不错，唯一的不足就是酒店给我的房间不在主楼，而且正对电梯大门，晚上感觉有些吵，窗户打开面对的是一个垃圾场，无法开窗比较煞风景，可能通过携程预定的酒店都给安排这种房间，不过在香格里拉能住到这样的酒店已经算不错了，据导游讲这可是当地市政府办的酒店，平时开会都会安排住这里，还订不到房呢，在这里除了天界神川就属龙凤祥还行了。,"The overall feeling is pretty good. The only shortcoming is that the hotel's room for me is not in the main building, and it is facing the elevator door. It feels a little noisy at night. The window opens to face a garbage dump.They are arranged for this kind of room, but it is good to be able to stay in such a hotel in Shangri -La. According to the tour guide, this is a hotel run by the local city government. Usually, the meeting will be arranged here.Shenchuan, Tianjie, is OK."
1,酒店环境比我想象的好，房间也非常干净。我住的是400一晚的。早餐时间比较短，睡过头了就没有去吃。但是古色古香的环境还是不错的。,"The hotel environment is better than I think, and the room is very clean.I live in 400 a night.The breakfast time is relatively short, and I do n’t eat when I sleep too much.But the antique environment is still good."
0,房价要四百多，但感到非常失望，陈旧，脏，比锦江之星还差。以后肯定不会再去了。这样的硬件设施和服务怎么吸引客人呢。,"House prices are more than four hundred, but I feel very disappointed. Old, dirty, worse than the star of Jinjiang.I will definitely not go again in the future.How to attract guests such hardware facilities and services."
1,酒店同意到两点钟退房还不错，早餐很差希望改进，上网很容易断线，服务还可以,The hotel agrees to check out at two o'clock. The breakfast is very poor and hope to improve. It is easy to disconnect the Internet.
0,我们7人同行，订了2间标房，1间三人房，到酒店入住时告知三人房与两间标房分别在两幢楼的，三人房checkin的时候又告知房间有问题，还要给了我们两间标房，房间内设施齐全，但是洗澡水放出来就象泥水，要放15分钟才干净，楼内服务台没有服务人员，总体感觉不是很满意。,"Our seven people walked together, ordered 2 standard rooms and one three -person room. When I went to the hotel, I told the three -person room and the two tidal rooms in the two buildings.It is also necessary to give us two benchmarks. The facilities in the room are complete, but the bath water is like mud water. It takes 15 minutes to clean. There is no service personnel in the building in the building. The overall feeling is not very satisfied."
1,通过携程预定了一间政要套房。入住当天（7月23日）我们一家四口加个保姆共五人，在十点半左右就到达了酒店门口。虽然说我们预定的套房还没打扫干净但很快的又给我们安排了另一套，服务非常好。从大堂到房间需要乘坐电瓶车，虽然进出要坐电瓶车，但只要拨打0号叫车，车子很快就到了还是挺方便的。有车的能自己开车，走路到大堂其实也不远，但夏天太热了还是坐车好。房间很干净不大但也不算太小，两房两厅一卫还有厨房。对我们5口人来说也正好。中午就迫不及待的跳到酒店的室内泳池里游泳。感觉水有点凉了但还是在里边泡了将近两小时才起来。回到房里果盘已送到了。在这里要吃海鲜很方便，酒店对面有海鲜大排档。到了晚上这里好热闹哦。早上的自助餐只给了两位，所以还得给保姆买一份88元，两个小孩（5岁和2岁）共58元。早餐88元一位感觉有点贵了，食物有待改进。希望下一次来会更好！总体来说对于选择了上海豪生棕榈滩大酒店我是很满意，下次再来还会入住这家酒店。,"A dignitaring suite was scheduled through Ctrip.On the day of staying (July 23), we had five nanny and a nanny in a total of five people, and arrived at the hotel door at about 10.30.Although we said that our scheduled suite has not been cleaned up, but we will arrange another set for us quickly, and the service is very good.From the lobby to the room, you need to take a battery car. Although you need to take a battery car in and out, as long as you call No. 0 to call the car, it is very convenient to get the car soon.If you have a car, you can drive by yourself. It is not far from walking to the lobby, but it is better to take a car in summer.The room is very clean but not too small. There are two rooms, two halls, and a kitchen.It is just right for us 5 people.I couldn't wait to jump to the hotel's indoor pool to swim at noon.It felt like the water was a bit cold, but it was soaked in it for nearly two hours.The fruit plate in the room has been delivered.It is convenient to eat seafood here. There are seafood stalls across the hotel.It's so lively here at night.In the morning, there were only two buffets, so I had to buy a nanny of 88 yuan, and the two children (5 years old and 2 years old) had a total of 58 yuan.Breakfast is 88 yuan a bit expensive, and food needs to be improved.I hope it will be better next time!Overall, I am very satisfied with the choice of Shanghai Haosheng Palm Beach Hotel. I will stay in this hotel next time."
1,"帮朋友定的,他们很满意,苏州园林特色.下次还会住.","They are satisfied with friends, they are very satisfied, Suzhou garden features. I will live next time."
1,入住豪华房，房间很大，但是有些设施显得有些陈旧。拖鞋很舒服。淋浴房漏水。还送水果，很不错。酒店的送餐不错，价格不算贵，量也挺多，味道也不错。checkout的速度很慢！,"Staying in luxury rooms, the rooms are large, but some facilities seem a bit old.Slippers are very comfortable.The shower room leaks.It also gives fruits, very good.The hotel delivery is good, the price is not expensive, the amount is quite a lot, and the taste is good.Checkout is very slow!"
1,山西去过没几次，但是感觉上最好的就是这个酒店。前台比较满意，浴室很干净。,"I have been to Shanxi a few times, but the best thing I feel is this hotel.The front desk is relatively satisfactory and the bathroom is clean."

1,4月12日住了一天，感觉还可以。是先前住在政协宾馆的，设施太差了，卫生条件也不好，才换到国贸来的。但是价格也有差距啊，政协420国贸820,"I lived on April 12 for a day, and I felt okay.It was previously living at the CPPCC Hotel. The facilities were too poor and the sanitary conditions were not good.But there is also a gap in the price. CPPCC 420 International Trade 820"
1,真是一个度假的好地方，那环境绝对棒极了！我们住的是标房，房间装修倒也一般，但打开阳台的门往外一看----眼前是青山湖的万顷碧波和悠悠群山。扑面而来的是无比清新的空气。俺和LP带着BABY坐在阳台上，看看外面的美景、泡一杯清茶，真有点乐不思蜀。这么好的房间居然只要200！只是不包早，包早每人再加20。我们在餐厅吃了个58的老鸭煲当晚饭，两个人都吃不完，那味道比杭州城里的红泥都要地道。下次，我们要约上几个兄弟好好来度假！补充点评2007年2月25日：俺们是从杭徽高速青山湖出口下的，又走了一段S102省道，过了一个隧洞。这条路比从临安出口下来离酒店要更远些，但可以经过千狮桥，还可以在千狮桥上停下来拍青山湖的照片。此外，还能节约5元钱(:,"It's a good place for vacation, the environment is absolutely great!We live in the benchmarking room, and the room decoration is also average, but the door of the balcony is opened to look out ---- There is the thousands of hectares of blue waves and mountains in Qingshan Lake.It was extremely fresh air.I and LP sat on the balcony with baby and looked at the beautiful scenery outside and made a glass of tea.Such a good room is only 200!It's just that you do n’t include it early, and you will add 20 per person early.We ate a 58 old duck in the restaurant for dinner. Both of them couldn't eat it. The taste was more authentic than the red mud in Hangzhou.Next time, we want to make a few brothers to come on vacation!Supplementary comment on February 25, 2007: We were under the exit of Qingshan Lake, Hangzhou and Hui High Speed, and took another section of S102 Provincial Road, and passed a tunnel.This road is farther away from the hotel from Lin'an, but it can pass through the Qianshi Bridge, and you can also stop on the Qianshi Bridge to take photos of Qingshan Lake.In addition, it can save 5 yuan (::"
1,酒店老一些没睡到大床外其馀都表现不错柜台人员服务很好早餐普通,The rest of the hotel does not sleep outside the big bed.
1,华君酒店也可以说就是公寓式酒店。酒店交通还是比较方便的，距离八佰伴，东昌路地铁站以及陆家嘴金融区都不太远。看过以前住客的点评，觉得现在酒店的服务要好很多，大概是节前客人比较少吧？！前台办理入住手续很快，且很热情。客房服务也不错。只是房间看上去有点旧，早餐一般，感觉不值68元。不过作为一般出差的选择还是可以的。希望旺季价格不要涨得太多，否则没法报销啦！,"Huajun Hotel can also be said to be an apartment -style hotel.Hotel transportation is still more convenient. It is not too far away from the eighth, Dongchang Road Metro Station and Lujiazui Financial Area.After watching the comments of the residents before, I think the service of the hotel is much better now. It is probably that there are fewer guests before the holiday?IntersectionThe front desk is fast and enthusiastic.The room service is also good.It ’s just that the room looks a bit old. Breakfast is average, it feels worth 68 yuan.However, as a general travel choice, it is still possible.I hope the price of the peak season will not rise too much, otherwise it will not be reimbursed!"

Our hotel is currently replacing water heaters. The construction problem is the construction of the Shenzhen Metro Project.Bring you inconvenience, we apologize!Thank you for your comments!"
1,入住的时候免费升级到行政楼层，房间硬件条件很好，要比万豪的设施好。但是遇到了大家都遇到过的，酒店的服务达不到五星级的水平。1、当天下午入住，洗了一件衬衣，因第二天早上9点多退房，要求加急并得到当天晚上送回的承诺，但第二天早上九点都未送回。打了两个催促电话以后，才于9点30分将衣服送回；2、退房的时候遇到的问题还是和洗衣服有关。在携程上订房的时候，看到可以赠送不超过78元的洗衣服务。我加急洗衬衣的费用为52元，但酒店前台工作人员要求我支付加急服务费。一再声称可以洗一套衣服，但洗一件的加急费不在这个范围内。由于要赶着去机场，就没有和携程确认，我便支付了18元的加急洗衣费。后酒店前台工作人员电话联系酒店销售部工作人员后，才明确酒店与携程的协议内容，后退给我该费用。总共退房时间超过了20分钟。所以觉得酒店硬件设施确实不错，但内部培训及沟通需要加强。,"When checking in, it is free to upgrade to the administrative floor. The hardware conditions in the room are very good, which is better than Marriott's facilities.But when everyone has encountered it, the hotel's service does not reach the level of five -star.1. In the afternoon of the day, I washed a shirt. Because I got out at 9 o'clock the next morning, I was required to be in a hurry and got the promise to return that night, but I did not return it at 9 am the next morning.After making two urging calls, the clothes were returned at 9:30; 2. The problems encountered when checking out are still related to washing clothes.When I was reservation in Ctrip, I saw a laundry service that can be given not more than 78 yuan.The fee for my urgency to wash the shirt is 52 yuan, but the front desk staff of the hotel asked me to pay the urgent service fee.Repeatedly claimed to wash a set of clothes, but the urgency fee of washing is not in this range.Because I had to go to the airport, I did not confirm with Ctrip, and I paid the urgent laundry fee of 18 yuan.After the staff of the hotel contacted the staff of the hotel's sales department, the front desk of the hotel made it clear that the agreement between the hotel and the Ctrip was clear, and the cost was retired.The total check -up time exceeded 20 minutes.Therefore, it is really good to feel that the hotel's hardware facilities are really good, but internal training and communication need to be strengthened."
0,"设施服务都一般化,性价比不高,在郑州的知名度太小,连出租车司机都不知道,不值得推荐","The facilities services are generally different, and the cost performance is not high. The popularity in Zhengzhou is too small. Even taxi drivers do not know."
1,第一次到兰州市区过夜，通过电话在携程网预定了友谊宾馆。这是一家原市委的招待宾馆，看建筑应该是有历史了。我入住的是嘉宾楼，标准间的设施还算可以，干净整洁。房间主要的缺点是电视比较老旧，电视台也比较少，信号不好，但是对于我基本不看电视也不算很大的问题。床单的素白以及卫生间的洁净还是让我对房间总体感觉不错。出了宾馆大门，附近就是繁华的商业街，尤其是菜根香和金鼎牛肉面非常不错，往西不远处敦煌路口东南大厦的三层，有一个很不错的网吧。宾馆对面是省博物馆，周边的环境总之很繁华便捷。,"For the first time, I went to Lanzhou City to spend the night, and I booked a friendly hotel at Ctrip.com through the phone.This is an entertainment hotel of the former municipal party committee. It should be a history of seeing the building.I stayed in the guest building, and the facilities in the standard room were okay, clean and tidy.The main disadvantage of the room is that the TV is older, there are fewer TV stations, and the signal is not good, but it is not a big problem for me not to watch TV.The plain white and the cleanliness of the sheets still make me feel good about the room.Out of the door of the hotel, there are bustling commercial streets nearby, especially Cai Genxiang and Jinding beef noodles are very good. There is a very good Internet cafe at the three floors of the southeast building in Dunhuang Road to the intersection of Dunhuang.Opposite the hotel is the Provincial Museum. The surrounding environment is bustling and convenient."
0,设施一般，比较旧。环境比较吵。二楼有个餐厅，人员往来较杂。退房时，清理房间的服务员竟然诬告用了什么洁牙水，晕！真是荒唐，令人气愤！估计是这个服务员自己拿了，反过来诬告客人。建议以后不要在房间里摆放那些收费的东西，需要什么客人可以到下面的杂货店购买，否则某些素质不高的服务员自己用了或拿了那些收费用品，搞得客人反倒恼火。,"The facilities are average, which is relatively old.The environment is noisy.There is a restaurant on the second floor.When checking out, the waiter who cleaned up the room even accused the tooth cleaning water, dizzy!It's ridiculous and angry!It is estimated that the waiter took it himself, and in turn, he accused the guests.It is recommended not to place those charges in the room in the future. What guests need to buy in the grocery store below. Otherwise, some waiters with low quality will use or take those charges by themselves, causing the guests to be annoyed."
1,在呼市出差，入住金辉酒店。酒店的房间、设施等相关条件，在300元左右的房价中算不错的。服务员态度很好。估计因为是工行下属的关系吧，酒店里没有那些乱七八糟的人，也没有骚扰电话。最满意的是酒店的地理位置极佳，餐饮、购物、银行、景点全离得很近。下次来呼市还会选择这里。补充点评2008年7月14日：金辉酒店自己的自助餐是38元一位，菜品冷+热+主食大概在20种左右，感觉与38元的价格比较全理。酒店2楼餐厅也可以点菜，如果您是2位以上用餐，就选择点菜吧，菜价不算贵，菜量那是相当的大。服气了。,"On a business trip in Hohhot, staying in Jinhui Hotel.The hotel's rooms, facilities and other related conditions are good in house prices around 300 yuan.The waiter attitude is very good.It is estimated that because of the affiliation of ICBC, there are no mess in the hotel, nor harassing calls.The most satisfied is that the hotel has excellent geographical location, and it is very close to catering, shopping, banking, and attractions.I will choose here next time.Supplementary comment on July 14, 2008: Jinhui Hotel's own buffet is 38 yuan, and the dishes are cold+hot+staple food about 20 types. It feels more reasonable with the price of 38 yuan.The restaurant on the 2nd floor of the hotel can also order. If you have more than 2 meals, choose to order. The price of the dishes is not expensive. The amount of food is quite large.I'm convinced."
0,21日入住，外观还不错。进入房间，发现网口不通，换房。换的房间床头开关是没用的；卫生间龙头冷热水开关方向反的；夜灯正对床，一开刺眼；房间连行李架都没有；最无法忍受的是半夜被严重的油漆味呛醒，无奈凌晨3点出逃换酒店。退房时刷卡系统又不灵了，信用卡预授权取消不了，至今我还冻结了1200元的额度。大堂副理签字免了我们住宿费，坦言新业主刚接手10几天，还在整改装修中。这样的饭店协程不该推荐，至少近期应该明示。,"Check in on the 21st, the appearance is not bad.Enter the room and find that the net mouth is not connected and changed the house.The bedside switch in the room is useless; the direction of the hot and cold water switch of the bathroom faucet is reversed; the night light is facing the bed, and the eyes are stabbed; there is no luggage rack in the room;Wake up, but no choice but to escape the hotel at 3 am.When checking out, the credit card system is not spiritual, the credit card has been authorized to be canceled, and so far I have frozen the amount of 1,200 yuan.The deputy manager of the lobby exempts our accommodation fee, and admits that the new owner has just taken over for more than 10 days and is still being modified.Such restaurant corporations should not be recommended, at least in the near future."
1,位置不错，购物方便，但是房间太小，同等价位在东莞这个地方没有竞争力，服务一般，前台都不懂得英文，酒店也不够大气。,"The location is good and convenient for shopping, but the room is too small. The same price is not competitive in the place in Dongguan. The service is average. The front desk does not know English, and the hotel is not atmospheric enough."
1,酒店地点不错；房间布置不太合理；离五星还有一些差距。,The hotel location is good; the room layout is not reasonable; there are still some gaps from the five -star.
1,比较值，房间东东都比较新。主要是政府人员在此活动。商品部非常贵－－有点宰人！,"Comparison, the rooms are relatively new.Mainly government officials are here.The commodity department is very expensive -a bit slaughtered!"
1,地理位置好，环境不错，房间很大，但是早餐不如过去丰盛，整体感觉不错。特别强调，服务好！,"The geographical location is good, the environment is good, the room is large, but the breakfast is not as rich in the past, and the overall feels good.Special emphasis, good service!"

1,白天在恐龙园游玩过后，12月30号在富都商贸酒店住了一晚，住的是508元的高级双床房，也就是最普通的一种，还不含早餐，这是2007年的周末特价优惠，算是赶了个末班车。在常州这应该是唯一的一个外资管理酒店了，而且Traders还是著名的香格里拉酒店集团下属的品牌，的确是冲着这个才选择的。带着昨晚对香树湾花园酒店的美好印象踏进了商贸酒店大堂，一下子体会到什么叫豪华，电梯lobby金碧辉煌，圣诞的气氛和装饰还没有撤掉，感觉真得很漂亮。前台的帅哥也很敬业，很替客人着想，主动推荐我办一张香格里拉金环会贵宾卡，这样可以免掉同住客人的早餐费用，还是很不错的。儿童是半价的。房间不是很大，但配备了一张舒适的丝绒面带脚凳的沙发椅，很舒服。床垫和枕头也是高品质的，空调很足，洗完澡穿着真丝的睡衣完全感觉不到室外正是0度的严寒，浴室也使同时设置了浴缸和淋浴房。保险柜，床头的闹钟和衣橱里的电熨斗烫衣板充分体现出作为商务酒店的特点，很周到。6楼有健身房和室内恒温泳池，31号一早晨自己到泳池里畅游了一下，29度，不冷，整个泳池只有我一个人，救生员也照样端坐在池边。晚饭没有在酒店吃，而是到酒店不远的通江路上的菜根香酒楼吃的饭，是个特色老饭店。由于酒店地处新区，从商业上讲周围不是很热闹。酒店的早餐品种和品质无疑很不错，通常高星级酒店早餐应有的中西日韩都包括了，所以也没有什么特别的惊喜。总之，满意！,"After playing at the dinosaur garden during the day, I stayed at the Fudu Trading Hotel for one night on December 30. I lived in a high -end double bed room of 508 yuan, which is the most common one.Special offers on weekends are the last bus.This should be the only foreign -funded hotel in Changzhou, and Traders is also the brand of the famous Shangri -La Hotel Group. It is indeed a choice for this.With the beautiful impression of the Xiangshu Bay Garden Hotel last night, I stepped into the Lobby of the Trade Hotel. I realized what is luxurious. The elevator lobby is brilliant. The Christmas atmosphere and decoration have not been removed. It feels really beautiful.The handsome guy at the front desk is also very dedicated, and he is very dedicated to the guests. He actively recommends that I will get a VIP card of the Shangri -La Golden Ring Club. This can avoid the cost of breakfast for the same guests, which is still very good.Children are half price.The room is not very large, but it is equipped with a comfortable velvet surface with a sofa chair with a stool, which is very comfortable.The mattresses and pillows are also high -quality, and the air conditioners are sufficient. After taking a bath, wearing a real silk pajamas do not feel that the outdoor is the severe cold of 0 degrees. The bathroom also sets the bathtub and shower room at the same time.The aircraft, the alarm clock on the bedside and the electric iron in the wardrobe fully reflect the characteristics of a business hotel, which is very thoughtful.On the 6th floor, there is a gym and indoor heating pool. On the morning of the 31st, I went to the pool on the 31st. I went to the pool. It was 29 degrees. It was not cold. The entire swimming pool was only me, and the lifeguard was still sitting on the side of the pool.Dinner is not eaten at the hotel, but a meal for the vegetable restaurant restaurant on Tongjiang Road, not far from the hotel, is a unique restaurant.Since the hotel is located in the new district, it is not very lively in business.Breakfast varieties and quality of hotels are undoubtedly good. Usually, high -star hotel breakfast should be included in China, Western, Japan and South Korea, so there are no special surprises.In short, satisfied!"

1,08.4.28-30号住了两天，感觉该酒店物超所值。干净宽敞，安静，床很舒服。洗澡水很热很大。值得再住。早餐很一般，但针对这个价格还可以了。,"08.4.28-30 lived for two days, and felt that the hotel was worth it.Clean and spacious, quiet, and the bed is very comfortable.Bathing water is very hot.It is worth living again.Breakfast is very average, but for this price is okay."
1,虽然遭遇台风“凤凰”，夜里没休息好，但极佳的位置，很好的服务总算弥补了一下。酒店旧了点，但时时处处能感受得到有一种底蕴。如有机会再去厦门，想体验一下面对鼓浪屿就餐的感觉......,"Although the typhoon ""Phoenix"" did not rest well at night, the excellent position and good service finally made up for it.The hotel is a bit old, but there is a kind of foundation everywhere.If you have a chance to go to Xiamen, I want to experience the feeling of dining for Gulangyu ..."
1,可能是以前总是随团旅游，没享受过很好的服务，但是这家酒店确实很值得推荐，多写一些评论吧。看了携程的评论以后才选择了这家酒店，环境绝对配得上花园这两个字，大堂挂的是四星，住了两晚，本来预定的时间是6月8日14:00入住―6月10日12:00，结果8日早上7点多到了酒店准备存行李，前台的工作人员告之有空房，可以提前入住，并且免费升级了房间（预定的是4楼经济标准间，给调到了2楼经济标准间，价格没变，不知道这算不算是升级服务，呵呵）。酒店整体环境很好，绿化很出色，晚饭后在院子里散步很惬意，酒店门口出租车很方面。出酒店南行大约5分钟即到海岸，出酒店北行见路口右转，街边有很多餐馆，打车到佳世客、家乐福等超市7元起步价+1元燃油费，出行很方便。房间内很整洁，有大床和单人床可以选择，房间内设施包括地板略显陈旧，厕所无浴缸，淋浴水很冲，24小时热水，由于这几天总是阴天，房内潮气很重。服务人员很专业，也很礼貌，入住和退房有人全程带行李（不知道用不用给小费，我是没给，嘎嘎），每天收拾两次，晚上还有免费的水果（两根香蕉+杏），没用到房内的宽带（好象是收费的，记不清楚了）。房间隔音系统不是很好，隔壁半夜时有个警察在打电话，好在我不是间谍，不然惟坊一带的这几天主要的通缉犯估计都抓不到了，哈哈，免费听了一个多小时的电话办案实战。下次有机会还会选择这家，试一试贵宾楼的服务，呵呵！！！有一点很郁闷，我在携程网上预定的经济标准间318元/天（携程价），但是在火车站有个携程站台工作人员给的蓝色的小本子上写的经济标准间是278元/天，没搞明白，是不是第二次再来就是278元/天呢？（在火车站回程的时候发的蓝色的小本子）,"It may be that I have always traveled with the group before, and I haven't enjoyed a good service, but this hotel is really worth recommending. Write more comments.After watching Ctrip's comment, I chose this hotel. The environment is definitely worthy of the two words of Garden. The lobby is hung with four stars. I lived for two nights.At 12:00 on June 10th, at 7 am on the 8th at 7 am, I arrived at the hotel to save my luggage. The staff at the front desk told the empty room and could stay in advance.After the economic standard room on the second floor, the price has not changed. I don't know if this is an upgrade service, huh).The overall environment of the hotel is very good, and the greening is excellent. It is very pleasant to walk in the yard after dinner. The taxi at the door of the hotel is very aspect.It ’s about 5 minutes to go to the coast in the south of the hotel. When the hotel travels north, you can turn right at the intersection. There are many restaurants on the streets. They take a taxi to the supermarket price of 7 yuan in supermarkets such as Jiashi, Carrefour and other supermarkets.The room is very neat, there are large beds and single beds to choose from. The facilities in the room include the floors are slightly old. There is no bathtub in the toilet. The shower water is very flustered.Very heavy.The service staff is very professional and polite. Someone takes care of and check out the whole process (I do n’t know if you use it, I do n’t give it, I do n’t give it, quack), and clean it twice a day. There are free fruits at night (two bananas+apricot), Not used in the broadband in the room (it seems to be charged, I can't remember it).The room sound insulation system is not very good. In the middle of the night, a policeman was calling. Fortunately, I am not a spy.Crossing the case in actual combat.Next time I have a chance to choose this one, try the service of the VIP building, huh!IntersectionIntersectionIt was very depressed. I booked 318 yuan/day (Ctrip in the Ctrip) I booked on the Internet of Ctrip, but there is a blue small book room written by a Ctrip platform staff at the railway station at 278 yuan/God, I did n’t understand, is it 278 yuan/day for the second time?(The blue small book sent when the train station returned)"
0,我是25日预定的单人大床房180元，当我到达前台时，我没有先说我预定的。问单人大床房现在是什么价？回答是168元，当时我很禁愕。我再告诉我的携程预定的。前台小姐只好按168元给我。到了房间表面看看一般，但隔壁房间的不大的说话声让人无法入睡，叫来服务员看了另外2个房间，都是一样的现象。最后只好捂着被子强迫自己睡。,"I was booked 180 yuan for single -person bedrooms on the 25th. When I reached the front desk, I did not say that I booked first.What is the price of a single -person bedroom now?The answer was 168 yuan, and I was banned at the time.I told me Ctrip I booked again.The front desk lady had to give me 168 yuan.When the room was on the surface of the room, it was average, but the not much of the room next door made people unable to fall asleep. The waiter came to see the other two rooms, all of which were the same phenomenon.In the end, he had to cover the quilt forced himself to sleep."
1,环境很好，紧邻太湖二桥，湖景房，房间不错，但不显大，电视节目不够多，还有就是携程的房间贵了，朋友电话直接定房，700元的湖景！,"The environment is very good. It is close to the second bridge of Taihu Lake, the lake view room, the room is good, but it is not large. There are not enough TV shows. There are also the rooms of Ctrip."
0,酒店位置在交通十字路口，服务员一问三不知！该酒店原名叫什么华夏酒店，估计为了吸引顾客，起了个洋名成了“雷梦得。。。。。”，不必住此店了！,"The hotel is located at the traffic crossroads, and the waiter asked three as soon as possible!What is the original name of the hotel called Huaxia Hotel? It is estimated that in order to attract customers, a foreign name has become ""Thunder Dream ..."", so you don't have to live in this shop!"

1,"朋友告诉我，是目前肇庆最好的酒店。值得期待的，因为酒店够大，中餐厅出品不错，房间设置还好，看得出酒店的江湖地位。说说要商榷的地方。370元的房价，按要求付了800远的按金，顺利入住。晚上在大堂吧喝了点东西，半夜一点买单95元人民币，以为可以签单，被告知不行，除非在前台另开消费卡。当晚的部长挺客气的，为我和前台沟通，结果可以登记我的入住按金收据号码然后签单。结果我正在洗澡的时候，电话响了，是前台，他们改变主意了，一定要我到前台开一张消费卡，哎哟！我只好答应我洗完澡后下楼去开一张消费卡。当我正准备穿衣服的时候，电话又响了，说不用了！谢谢！我真的要睡觉了。第二天，我们办好了checkout,到中餐厅吃饭，结果先生有点不舒服，于是我们又重新登记入住，这回，前台也没有问我们是否需要消费卡，只是收800大元按金。当晚，两公婆又在大堂吧喝点东西，打烊时，问是否可以签单，当晚的服务员是这样回答的：“今天晚上你必须付现金！”我早有准备，赶紧拿出65元买单。我发现，这里很多曾千年雪封过的俊男美女服务员，缺少服务行业的职业微笑和礼貌，很纳闷，怎么这里的服务员都不会说“请”“谢谢”等行业用语，虽然，旁边华侨大厦是的装修已经旧一点，但那里餐厅推车仔的阿姨给你端上凤爪、排骨、叉烧包，在你的单上盖印的时候，也微笑说一声“谢谢”，在走廊服务员遇到客人也会说一声“早上好”。","My friend told me that it is the best hotel in Zhaoqing.It is worth looking forward to, because the hotel is large enough, the Chinese restaurant is good, and the room settings are good. You can see the hotel status of the hotel.Talk about the place where you want to discuss.The housing price of 370 yuan paid 800 distances as required and passed away smoothly.In the lobby at night, I drank something, and bought a bill of 95 yuan in the middle of the night. I thought I could sign the order and the argument was not told unless the consumer card was opened in the front desk.The minister was very polite that night to communicate with me and the front desk. As a result, I can register my check -in and receive the bill and sign the bill.As a result, when I was taking a bath, the phone rang. It was the front desk. They changed their minds. I must go to the front desk to open a consumer card, oh!I had to promise me to go downstairs to open a consumer card after taking a shower.When I was about to wear clothes, the phone rang again, saying no!Thanks!I really want to sleep.The next day, we had checkout and ate at the Chinese restaurant. As a result, the gentleman was a bit uncomfortable, so we registered for staying again. This time, we did not ask us if we needed a consumer card, but just received 800 yuan.That night, the two parents -in -law drank something in the lobby. When they snorted, they asked if they could sign the bill. The waiter that night answered this night: ""You have to pay cash tonight!"" I had a preparation and hurriedly took out 65 yuan to pay.I found that many handsome men and beautiful waiters who have been sealed for thousands of years have lacking career smiles and politeness in the service industry. They are very puzzled. How can the waiters here do not say ""please"" and ""thank you"" and other industry terms. Although, the Overseas Chinese Building next to itYes, the decoration is already older, but the aunt of the restaurant traveler will bring you phoenix claws, pork ribs, and barbecued pork buns. When you cover it on your single, he also smiles ""Thank you"".The guests will also say ""Good morning""."
1,7月17日入住的，在携程上定的套餐。总体感觉酒店还是不错的，交通很便利。离时代广场走路最多10分钟，所以坐地铁方便。而且酒店周边公交车也很多，到海洋公园、浅水湾都很便利的！服务也还好，房间比想象中要好正对跑马场。给了2天的矿泉水。酒店的班车大家可以多多利用可以省下很多的时间和脚力下次我们到香港还会入住的！,"For the set meal settled on Ctrip on July 17.Overall feels that the hotel is still good, and the traffic is convenient.It takes up to 10 minutes to walk from Times Square, so it is convenient to take the subway.And there are many bus around the hotel. It is very convenient to go to Ocean Park and shallow water bay!The service is also good. The room is better than the racetrack.Give 2 days of mineral water.Hotels in the hotel can use a lot of time to save a lot of time and foot power. Next, we will stay in Hong Kong!"
0,缺点：1.酒店靠近铁路，晚上睡觉非常吵2.酒店隔音效果非常差，邻居像和自己住在同一个房间3.加床质量很差，非常不舒服4.要求增加一床被子，前台服务员以“我们酒店只有两床备用的被子，已经全部用完”为由拒绝，后经过与酒店经理交涉，才解决问题。优点：1.交通比较方便，距离火车站不远。2.临近淘宝街，人人乐购物超市，比较方便。建议：希望携程将酒店的信息表述的更加详尽，无论是缺点还是优点。,"Disadvantages: 1. The hotel is close to the railway and sleeps at night. 2. The sound insulation effect of the hotel is very poor. The neighbor is like living in the same room as itself. 3. The quality of the bed is very uncomfortable.It was rejected on the grounds that ""our hotel has only two quilts of backups and has been used up"", and later negotiated with the hotel manager to solve the problem.Advantages: 1. The transportation is more convenient, not far from the railway station.2. Near Taobao Street, everyone is more convenient.Suggestion: I hope that Ctrip will express the hotel's information more detailed, whether it is disadvantages or advantages."
1,和大部分如家差不多，就是半夜出酒店的话，外面有很多卖小吃的摊子，不错,"Similar to most of the home, if you are out of the hotel in the middle of the night, there are many stalls selling snacks outside."
0,当地的知名度挺高，出租车司机都知道，大楼顶上高挂民航的招牌；酒店设施有点成旧，入住一小时后，感觉房间内没有什么暖意，用手试了一下取暖器，发现没有热气，于是想与总台联系，但在房间内找了半天，除了在显著位置有按摩中心的电话外，实在找不到总台与客房中心的电话，只得下楼去。还好在电梯内碰到客房服务员。回房间后不久，服务员打来电话说管道老化给换间房，于是带着行李搬家。房间内的设施也很旧，有浴缸，淋浴的水很大，蛮舒服的，毛巾很旧还有破洞。早餐有各式各样的菜，感觉冷冰冰的，吃得很少。因为是下午3点的飞机，跟总台商量可不可以晚一个小时退房，总台小姑娘把头一别说不成！虽然换了房总觉得房间内不够热，得穿很厚的毛衣才行，于是第二天睡觉时又加了一条被子，到半夜就冻醒了，觉得奇怪，去试了一下暖气片，冰凉的。只能披上外衣，半夜3点下到总台，总台小姑娘马上叫来一个小伙子，一看是穿警服的。小姑娘对小伙子说看又来一个叫冷的。然后对我说，，你住的房间窗户大本来就够冷的，给你换间房，还有一样冷的房。问能否换一间窗小一点的，服务员脸一拉说，不行要价钱。这么随便就换房，在订房时协程不是说房间很紧张，没有信用卡担保还不让订，后来留意一下其实入住率极低。没办法只能换房，于是半夜三更收拾起所有的行李，先到总台换房卡，然后再去新的房间，服务员始终带着奇怪的面容看着，没有任何欠意的表示，也许值夜班也无聊，总算有点乐子。到了新房间，还是冰凉的，才发现走廊上有客房中心的电话，打过去，服务员说半夜里酒店把暖气给停了，说除了有备有被子外还有备用毯子可以都盖上。天哪！次日起床后就觉得肠胃冻坏了，咕咕叫，还拉肚子。等到中午退房，总台最显著位置放着按摩中心的广告牌，墙上挂着“四星级酒店”“青年文明号”“吉林省优秀服务单位”等招牌，不由得长叹一声。这肯定是一家民航系统的国营酒店，所以服务意识基本上还停留在“在举目无亲的他乡赏你一个铺你就该感激涕零”的文革时代。对于国营酒店，国家旅游局向来有1～2颗星的水份。,"The local popularity is very high, and the taxi drivers know that the signboard of civil aviation on the top of the building is a bit old. After staying in the room for an hour, I feel that there is no warmth in the room.There was no heat, so I wanted to contact the main station, but I found it in the room for a long time. Except for a phone call in a prominent position, I couldn't find a call from the head station and the guest room center, so I had to go downstairs.Fortunately, the room waiter encountered the room waiter in the elevator.Shortly after returning to the room, the waiter called and said that the pipeline was aging to change the room, so he moved his luggage.The facilities in the room are also very old. There are bathtubs. The shower is very large and comfortable. The towels are very old and there are holes.There are all kinds of dishes for breakfast. They feel cold and eat very little.Because it is a plane at 3 pm, can you check out for an hour with the total number of Taiwanese businessmen?Although I always felt that the room was not hot enough, I had to wear a thick sweater, so I added another quilt when I slept the next day, and I was frozen in the middle of the night. I felt strange.of.I can only put on my coat and go to the head station at 3 o'clock in the middle of the night. The little girl in the head office immediately called a young man.The little girl said to the young man who was cold.Then I said to me, the windows you live in are all cold enough, giving you a room for you, and the same cold room.Ask if you can change a window smaller, and the waiter's face said, not the price.Change the house casually. When booking, the coroutine does not mean that the room is very tight. There is no credit card guarantee and it will not be allowed to book. Later, it is important to pay attention to the low entry rate.There is no way to change the house, so I picked up all my luggage in the middle of the night, went to the main station to change the house, and then went to the new room. The waiter always looked at it with strange faces.It's boring, and it's a bit happy.When I arrived at the new room, I was still cold, and I found that there was a call from the guest room center in the corridor. The waiter said that the hotel stopped the heating in the middle of the night.Oh my god!After getting up the next day, I felt that my stomach was frozen, gurgling, and diarrhea.By the time of check -up, the main station was the most prominent position with the billboard of the massage center. There were signboards such as ""four -star hotels"", ""Youth Civilization"" and ""Excellent Service Unit in Jilin Province"" hanging on the walls.This must be a state -owned hotel of a civil aviation system, so the service awareness is basically staying in the Cultural Revolution era that ""you should be grateful to the nose in the other country where you are not close to you.""For state -owned hotels, the National Tourism Administration has always had 1 to 2 stars."
0,不知道是不是我身边的朋友对酒店都太挑还是真的是酒店环境只是那么好。本来预订几个晚上的，可是他们只住了一个晚上就换了地方。,"I don't know if my friends around me are too picky or really the hotel environment.Originally booking for a few nights, but they changed only one night and changed the place."
1,酒店外墙在装修，门口很小，进入大门后是G层，然后乘电梯到一层Check-in。酒店的房间很小，进门后是一条笔直的单人走道，往里走二步后的左手边是二张紧贴着墙的单人床，中间是一条单人走道，整个房间除了这2条走道，没有其余的行走空间，虽然房间小的可怜，我仍然觉得感觉还不坏，原因一可能是因为房间非常干净，小而干净的房间反而给人一种温馨的感觉，原因二是因为与同在弥墩道的汉普顿相比简直是一个天一个地。酒店离地铁站非常近，步行2分钟，在香港只要能乘到地铁，去任何地方都是非常方便的。到了晚上，酒店附近的广东街会有很多小吃、排档，非常的方便。,"The exterior wall of the hotel is decorated, the door is small, after entering the door is the G floor, and then take the elevator to a layer of check-in.The hotel's room is small. After entering the door, there is a straight single walkway. After walking in two steps, the left hand side is two single beds close to the wall. There is a single walkway in the middle.The aisle, there is no rest of the walking space. Although the room is small, I still feel that it is not bad. The reason may be because the room is very clean. The small and clean room gives a warm feeling.Hampton, who is in Midun Road, is simply one day.The hotel is very close to the subway station. It is very convenient to walk in Hong Kong as long as it can be taken to the subway in Hong Kong.In the evening, there will be a lot of snacks and stalls near the hotel near the hotel, which is very convenient."
0,觉得是住过酒店最差的一家，一楼房间接近地下层，空气不好，而且酒店还在涮漆整修中，油漆气味很难闻....早上七点钟不到，施工人员和服务人员就在走廊上吵到不行....而且，酒店位置很难找，在胡同里！...总之印象超差,"I think it is the worst one who has lived in the hotel. The room on the first floor is close to the underground floor, the air is not good, and the hotel is still in pain.The personnel are so noisy in the corridor .... Moreover, the hotel location is difficult to find, in the hutong!... In short, the impression is super worse"
1,"适合一大家子外出居住,不过最好是有车.公寓的条件是很好的,确实令人满意.","Suitable for a large family to live, but it is best to have a car. The conditions for the apartment are very good, which is really satisfactory."
0,房间奇型怪状，环境一般，厕所超大，床超小，价格较高，送餐居然还要收服务费，要不是如家客满，我才不会去住。,"The room is strange, the environment is average, the toilet is large, the bed is very small, the price is high, and the service fee will be charged. If it is not full of home, I will not live."
1,这次去大理，入住这家酒店，整体感觉很好，白族姑娘服务不错，房间也不错呀！还算干净！交通也方便！！赞一个！！,"This time I went to Dali and stayed in this hotel. The overall feeling was very good. The Bai girl service was good, and the room was good!It's clean!Transportation is also convenient!Intersectiongive it a like!Intersection"
1,房间非常不错，价格也合理。下次去还会入住这里。,The room is very good and the price is reasonable.I will stay here next time.
0,我预订的这个房间是这个宾馆最小的房间，也是我住过的所有酒店中最小的，小到不能再小。没有衣橱，没有茶几，没有浴缸。我一共住5晚，入住第3日半夜1点40分有按摩小姐敲门，打电话到总台投诉，虽说立刻有保安过来，但未得到宾馆任何道歉。,"The room I booked is the smallest room of this hotel, and the smallest of all the hotels I have lived in. It is too small.No wardrobe, no coffee table, no bathtub.I lived in a total of 5 nights and moved in at 1:40 at 1:40 in the middle of the night on the 3rd on the 3rd on the night of the night. I called the Massage Massage and called the head station to complain. Although there was a security guard immediately, I did not get any apology in the hotel."
1,十一入住了春晖，龙熙和度假村，另外也去了九华山庄。九华不是在携程定的，就不说了。一春晖在顺义，交通一般。周围环境还算可以，是农田。但内部环境一般，最起码没有想象的好。施工是一部分原因。度假村的整体设计一般，布局不合理。比如，康体中心设在大门口，而宾馆在最里面。我想这是分期建设的原因，也不好改。,"Eleven stayed in Chunhui, Longxi and Resort, and also went to Jiuhua Villa.Jiuhua was not determined by Ctrip, so I won't say it.Yichunhui is in Shunyi, and traffic is average.The surrounding environment is okay, it is farmland.But the internal environment is average, at least not as good as imagined.Construction is part of the cause.The overall design of the resort is average and the layout is unreasonable.For example, Kang Sports Center is located at the gate, and the hotel is in the innermost.I think this is the reason for installment construction, and it is not easy to change."
1,房间和设施都符合四星标准，不足方面有：1，服务水平一般2，房间里的中央空调噪音极大，像拖拉机3，该酒店4楼的KTV生意火爆，晚上2点还有超级女生和快乐男生的情歌对唱，声音洪亮清晰无比，从晚上11点投诉至2点依然无任何改善。,"The rooms and facilities meet the four -star standard. Insufficient aspects are: 1. The level of service is generally 2. The central air -conditioning in the room is extremely noisy, like tractors 3, the KTV business on the 4th floor of the hotel is hot.The love song of a happy boy, the voice is bright and clear, and it still has no improvement from the complaint from 11 pm to 2 o'clock."
1,"酒店挺不错的,地段也好,门口的服务生也很热情.只是最近在装修,早上八点多就开始敲墙,把我吵醒了,有点影响睡眠.但总体来说还是挺不错的,值得入住.","The hotel is pretty good, the location is good, and the waiter at the door is also very enthusiastic. It is just renovating recently. I started knocking on the wall at eight o'clock in the morning and awakened me.It is worth checking in."
1,checkin和checkout都非常神速。服务员态度很好，回答关于旅游的问题很热情。需要帮助打电话给前台，响应速度也很快。感觉比较亲切～房间干净，落地窗比较敞亮，住高点可以看到维港。房间比较安静。休息得不错～楼下有几个茶餐厅很方便，味道也不错。附近有诺士佛台酒吧一条街，别有洞天。下次还会选择这家酒店。,"Checkin and Checkout are very fast.The waiter has a good attitude and answered the question about travel very enthusiastic.Need to help call the front desk, and the response speed is fast.It feels more kind ~ the room is clean, the floor -to -ceiling windows are relatively bright, and you can see Victoria Harbor.The room is relatively quiet.The rest is good ~ There are a few tea restaurants downstairs, which is very convenient and tastes good.Nearby there is a street in a Nuns Buddha Bar, there are no holes.I will choose this hotel next time."
1,房间地理位置不怎么好，比较背，藏起来一样的，后面就是居民楼，没有任何风景。不过房间很新，服务挺好，适合长期住，比较安静。不过打车池坊都不是很方便的。周围四不靠。,"The geographical location of the room is not very good. It is comparable to the same back. It is the same as the residential building. There is no scenery.However, the room is very new, the service is very good, it is suitable for long -term living and relatively quiet.But the taxi pond is not very convenient.There are no surroundings."
0,房间很小，设施的装修都不如它旁边的姊妹酒店，但其实两家价格相差无几。服务态度比较一般，自助早餐就在一楼酒吧里面，感觉比较差。老实说，到了才发现酒店后面是一片蔚为壮观的坟场，当即想要取消预定，但酒店死活要扣钱（据携程表述），不得已免为其难住了一晚。可怜我这次去香港还和女友一起，我们再也不会住这家酒店了。补充点评2008年7月10日：对了，这家店的门牌也是相当的诡异。也许是我们先看到后面的坟地的原因，上楼之后看所有的房门上都没有门票，正面墙上也没有门牌，我们都不约而同背脊发凉……还好我很快低头发现门牌在……地上的门槛石上，我瀑布汗――太吓人了,"The room is very small, and the decoration of the facility is not as good as the sister hotel next to it, but in fact the price is almost the same.The service attitude is relatively average. The buffet breakfast is in the bar on the first floor, and it feels poor.Honestly, I found that behind the hotel was a spectacular cemetery, and I immediately wanted to cancel the reservation, but the hotel had to deduct money (according to Ctrip), and it was not difficult to stay for one night.Poor I will go to Hong Kong with my girlfriend this time, and we will never live in this hotel anymore.Supplementary comment on July 10, 2008: By the way, the door of this store is also quite weird.Maybe it was the reason why we first saw the graveyard behind. After going upstairs, there were no tickets on the door of all the rooms, and there were no house cards on the front wall.… On the threshold stone on the ground, my waterfall sweat -too scary"
1,酒店地理位,Hotel location
1,太偏僻，不过非常安静，还有酒店为了省钱，居然没开空调，感觉不太好！免费注册网站导航宾馆索,"Too remote, but very quiet, and the hotel did not turn on the air conditioner in order to save money, it feels not good!Free registered website navigation hotel cable"
1,酒店很好，装修得体，服务佳，性价比高。赠送的早餐非常丰富，晚上自助餐及其丰盛，而且品质高。前一天我在索菲特楼顶花了220加15%，吃的东西还不如梅苑，当然风景要好很多，但梅苑只要88。非常适合商务客，自费度假也不错，离西湖有7、8公里，打车有时不太好打，做15路公交可到湖边。,"The hotel is very good, decent, good service, high cost -effective.The free breakfast is very rich, the buffet is rich and rich at night, and the quality is high.The day before, I spent 220 plus 15%on the top of the Sofitt building. The food was not as good as Meiyuan. Of course, the scenery was much better, but Meiyuan only needed 88.It is very suitable for business guests, and it is also good at the self -funded vacation. It is 7 or 8 kilometers from the West Lake. Sometimes it ’s not easy to fight for a taxi. You can get to the lake by bus 15."
1,订的豪华单人间，进房间居然是两张床的标间，到总台交涉说是没有了，差点让我换酒店，最后把豪华套房给我住了，按原来订的价格算，前后时间花了不少。第二天结账刷卡的单子打不出来，据说是纸没装好，看看都打电话给农行了，我就先去办了事，中午回去拿到了。感觉服务人员设备使用方面有欠缺，这么个小设备几个人都搞不定，晕。,"The luxury single room ordered the room is actually the standard room of the two beds. It was gone to the main station and said that it was gone. I almost asked me to change the hotel. Finally, I gave me a luxury suite.It took a lot.The day after the check -in card was not available, it was said that the paper was not installed. Seeing that I called the Agricultural Bank of China. I went to do things first and got back at noon.It feels that the service staff is lacking in the use of equipment. Several people in such a small equipment are unbearable and dizzy."
0,已经多次入住了，但是这次的入住十分不愉快！07-06-8周末到的，加班赶一个文件到了晚上12点多，正准备发邮件，发现网线不通了，于是向酒店反映。结果服务员找到了值班经理来，一会说没有办法，一会说是电信的问题。我说我一定要发这个邮件出去。但是她说没有办法，IT人员回去了。我说是否可以请他回来。她说太晚了。然后就说帮我找个房间上网。我在房间等到1点多，还没有回答，就电话去问。结果那位经理说没有办法知道哪间房还是好的。我很生气！找不到居然也不通知我！让我在房间苦等！最后说可以让我到商务中心去发。这个酒店，或者说这个经理的服务意识也太差了：居然可以把客人折腾得上上下下，而自己的员工可以在家睡觉！看来我是要重新找一个地方了！,"I have stayed many times, but this time I stayed very unhappy!From the weekend of 07-06-8, it was more than 12 o'clock in the evening when I was working overtime. I was preparing to send an email and found that the network cable was unreasonable, so I reported to the hotel.As a result, the waiter found a duty manager, and he said that there was no way, and it was a matter of telecommunications.I said I must send this email.But she said that there was no way, IT staff went back.I said whether he could ask him to come back.She said it was too late.Then I said to help me find a room to go online.I waited at the room until more than 1 o'clock and didn't answer, so I asked.As a result, the manager said that there was no way to know which house was good.I am angry!If you can't find it, you don't notify me!Let me wait in the room!Finally, I can let me go to the business center.This hotel, or this manager's service consciousness is too bad: you can toss the guests up and down, and their employees can sleep at home!It seems that I want to find a place again!"
0,"这个酒店基本就是低价海南旅游团住的那种招待所吧，周围极度荒凉。距离三塔很近，但是在后/侧墙外，距离大门口还有一段距离大约五、六百米。房间不小但是还是用普通球锁＋自己拿钥匙，很久没见过号称四星级但是这样子的招待所了，出门一定要按下屋那的那边，否则你就会彻底大开门一整天了。另外，号称四星，但是结帐时候竟然不能提供消费详单（水单），而且从老总到客务部经理到前台服务员都坚决没听说过住宿酒店给开了发票还要提供水单的。服务业提议拿别的酒店的水单来看看，是否能帮忙打印一下，但是客务部经理说“我们有电脑也有打印机，但是绝对不能给你用来打印！”问道这是代表个人还是酒店时候，答案是代表酒店。――导致我随手摔上了电话――手柄裂开了！至于物品损坏的赔偿，也是随口报价，注：一个普通的市话话机“原价”200大元，而且另外出去买一个座位赔偿是不被允许的！更可笑的是你如果表示罚多了，马上以态度不好而数额加倍，并且“四百块钱少一分钱也别想离开”（一把手,老板的原话）。只好争取好态度，交钱也不要发票来争取到“原价”赔付。早饭有时候是自助，虽然东西不怎么样，但是十来种东西呢，吃饱没问题，但是住客少了就成了份儿饭了（号称桌餐），品种也只有两三样了。承诺和古城内的班车也没准儿，虽然因为是淡季，按照要求原先电话提前一小时联系了，但是还是在原地打了4次催促的电话，等了30分钟车才到（实际酒店到古城距离2km左右）。除了旅行社的低价团，建议大家就还是在古城内众多的酒店住下吧，价格一般是这里的一半，还可以方便地夜游古城。对了，你们谁见过房间不能上网的四星级标间吗？古城里面遍地是WLAN信号，我上网都是背着电脑去古城的。在携程网上投诉后，携程表示考虑下年是否还与这样的酒店签约了，还奖励500分。可惜时间、现金、心情的损失无法弥补。","This hotel is basically the kind of guest house where the Hainan tour group lives in the low -cost Hainan tour group, which is extremely desolate around.It is very close to the three towers, but outside the back/side wall, there is a distance of about five or 600 meters away from the gate.The room is not small, but I still use ordinary ball locks + my own key. I have never seen a four -star room for a long time, but such a hospitality house. You must press the side of the house when you go out.It's right.In addition, it is known as the four stars, but the consumer detailed list (water list) can not be provided at the checkout, and from the old manager to the manager of the official affairs department to the front desk waiter, I have never heard that the accommodation hotel has issued an invoice and provided the water order.EssenceThe service industry proposes to take the water list of other hotels to see if it can be used to print it, but the manager of the Ministry of Mission said, ""We have computers and printers, but you must not use it for you!"" Asked whether this represents individuals or individuals orDuring the hotel, the answer is to represent the hotel.——This caused me to get on the phone -the handle was cracked!As for the compensation of the damage of the item, it is also a casual offer. Note: an ordinary market ""original price"" 200 yuan, and it is not allowed to go out to buy a seat compensation!What is even more ridiculous is that if you have a lot of penalties, you will double the amount with a bad attitude, and ""don't want to leave for four hundred dollars less money"" (the first word, the original words of the boss).I have to strive for a good attitude, and do not invoice to get the ""original price"" compensation.Breakfast is sometimes self -service. Although things are not good, but do a dozen things, there is no problem to eat, but the residents are less (known as table meals), and the variety is only two or three.The promise and the bus in the ancient city may not be possible. Although because it was off -season, the original phone was contacted for an hour in advance according to the requirements, but I still made 4 urged calls in the place and waited for 30 minutes.About 2km).In addition to the low -cost groups of travel agencies, it is recommended that everyone stay in the many hotels in the ancient city. The price is generally half here, and it can also easily travel to the ancient city at night.By the way, have you ever seen the four -star standard room that can't access the Internet?There are WLAN signals everywhere in the ancient city. I go to the ancient city with a computer on the Internet.After Ctrip's online complaint, Ctrip said that considering whether to sign a contract with such a hotel next year, and rewarded 500 points.Unfortunately, the loss of time, cash, and mood cannot be made up."
1,本来订这里是因为它算山上比较便宜的，后来入住发现，比想象中的好很多。起码很干净。就是隔音效果不太好，早上隔壁人去看日出，那个吵啊～～其它的感觉还不错,"Originally, it was because it was cheaper on the mountain. Later, I found that it was much better than expected.At least very clean.The sound insulation is not very good. People next door to see the sunrise in the morning, that noisy ~~ Other feelings are not bad"
1,按照入住同事的说法，可能在马鞍山算不错了，不过不太对得起价格，尤其是早餐比较惨～,"According to the colleagues in the stay, it may be good in Ma'anshan, but it is not worth the price, especially the breakfast is miserable ~"
0,酒店空调有问题!蚊子太多!简直无法入睡!!!服务员的态度还不错的!,There is a problem with the hotel air conditioner! There are too many mosquitoes! I can't sleep !!! The waiter's attitude is not bad!
1,酒店环境很好，别墅每层都很高，宽敞，只是晚上比较冷清，只能到几公里外的博鳌镇上逛逛买点水果什么的．这次去时估计是客人较少，早餐不是自助是分别点的，中式早餐粮食太多（粥，炒面，馒头包子，一些花生米榨菜半个咸鸭蛋），西式的还可以，但不问的话没有主动给咖啡，奶（不知为什么）．酒店所有人员．补充点评2007年11月15日：浴室光线较暗，没有挂衣服的地方．同意前面几位的说法，环境和服务都好，就是内部不能细看．,"The hotel environment is very good. Each floor of the villa is very high and spacious, but it is relatively deserted at night. You can only go to Boao Town a few kilometers away to buy some fruits or something.It is estimated that there are fewer guests when I go, and the breakfast is not separated by self -service. There are too many Chinese breakfast food (porridge, fried noodles, steamed buns, and some peanut rice mustard half of the salted duck eggs).No active giving coffee, milk (I don't know why).All staff of the hotel.Supplementary comment on November 15, 2007: The light of the bathroom is darker and there is no place to hang clothes.Agree with the previous statement, the environment and services are good, but internal cannot be carefully read."
1,酒店位置其实很明显，但因为携程地图不清晰也或者是我不太会找，找酒店费了一点周折，但酒店的各方面设施给了我们安慰，酒店的服务人员都非常有礼貌，无论是前台或在走道上碰到了都不错．床也很舒服。,"The location of the hotel is actually obvious, but because the map of Ctrip is unclear or I don't know how to find it, it is a bit of a bit of discounting to the hotel, but the facilities of the hotel have given us comfort.It is good to meet the front desk or on the aisle.The bed is also very comfortable."
1,"订的是房,房间大.乾净,有气味,通风不错,全.豪的有大床.的是向路的房,好不算太吵.服务:OK.插3次才能用,不得快的就是.打车:到那都很近,站,火站二十元.缺:有椅子被了一洞~早餐不的,希望那一天多可以吃多一....","The room is a room, the room is large, clean, smelling, good ventilation, full. There is a large bed. The room is the road, so it is not too noisy. Service: OK. You can use it 3 times to use it. You must not be fast.That is. Taxi: It's very close, stand, the fire station is 20 yuan. Lack: There is a chair being a hole ~ Breakfast, I hope to eat more than one day ...."
1,和LP一起订的度假，发现三合比较紧俏，于是赶紧下了订单。在三合感觉中国人绝对是“少数民族”估计老外对这个酒店可能比较熟悉，早餐是在酒店外（第一次这种体会，呵呵），出门向左50米（路对面），叫阳光和酒吧。只有第二天早上看到一对中国人，其他全是老外，感觉有点奇怪。早餐内容太少了。酒店内比较别致，很有古城的味道，房间内的家具比较紧凑，不过两个人住应该还好了。热水似乎不行，放了很长时间都是温水。电视奇高无比，晚上看会电视脖子酸，信号也一般。不过如果是体验古城味道，的确是个不错的选择。,"On vacation with LP, I found that Sanhe was relatively tight, so I quickly got the order.It is estimated that foreigners may be more familiar with the hotel in the ""minority ethnic group"" in Sanhe. Breakfast is outside the hotel (for the first time, haha), go out to the left 50 meters (opposite the road), called the sun and the sun.bar.I saw a pair of Chinese only the next morning, and the others were all foreigners, which felt a little strange.The breakfast content is too small.The hotel is more chic and has the taste of the ancient city. The furniture in the room is relatively compact, but the two people should be fine.The hot water does not seem to work, it is warm water for a long time.The TV is extremely high, and the TV neck is sore at night, and the signal is average.However, if it is experienced the taste of the ancient city, it is indeed a good choice."
0,"服务太差了,堂堂的五星酒店房间里竟连一双拖鞋也没有,连一般的小旅馆也不如,调来调去调了一个垃圾酒店,让人太失望了.","The service is too bad. There is even a pair of slippers in the five -star hotel room in the dignified hotel. Even the average small hotel is not as good. It is tuned to adjust a garbage hotel, which is too disappointing."
1,忘了说，那边的无线上网信号不够好，我们每次都要抱着笔记本到总台去，这个问题能不能解决啊，毕竟不如在自己房间上网舒服自在,Forgot to say that the wireless Internet signal over there is not good enough. We have to hold the laptop to the head station every time. Can this problem be solved?
1,前台服务很好，房间很不错，干净宽敞，有一个小小的花园，据说是四星，我订的时候倒没在意这些，但入住后还是蛮喜欢的但一定要住B楼，A楼对大街，喇叭要吵到晚上九、十点。PS：宾馆后面是所谓亚洲第一喷泉，晚上八点开始，居然延续有半个小时，还是挺壮观的,"The front desk service is very good, the room is very good, clean and spacious, there is a small garden. It is said to be four stars. I didn't care about this when I booked it, but I still like it after check -in.On the street, the horn will be noisy until 9 or 10 in the evening.PS: Behind the hotel is the so -called first fountain in Asia. Starting at 8 o'clock in the evening, it lasted for half an hour, which is still spectacular."
0,"酒店位置较偏僻，环境清净，交通也方便，但酒店及周边就餐选择不多;浴场海水中有水草,水亦太浅,不太理想;有A2水上运动中心基地,能进行帆板运动，是亮点;酒店设施陈旧、简陋,清洁一般，但房间面积足够大；早餐不好，更糟糕的是因本人去时有旅行团，人较多，接待能力不足，甚至早餐盘简单冲洗后即重复使用，非常不卫生，我夫人当即拒绝早餐，并表示立即退房（本来预订了2天），另外，晚上加个枕头还要收取清洗费，以前未遇到过。","The hotel location is relatively remote, the environment is clean, and the transportation is also convenient, but there are not many choices of hotels and surrounding meals; there are water plants in the seawater in the bath, and the water is too shallow and not ideal.Highlights; the hotel facilities are old, humble, and clean, but the room area is large enough; the breakfast is not good, and the worse is because I have travel groups when I go.It was very unhygienic. My wife immediately refused to breakfast and stated that she immediately retired (originally booked for 2 days). In addition, I had to charge a cleaning fee at night. I have not encountered it before."
1,第一次在宁海住酒店，印象最深的是服务好，无论在哪碰到服务生都会微笑地打招呼。住的是标房，房间挺大的，但床有点硬，不太舒服，早餐非常一般,"The first time I stayed at the hotel in Ninghai, the most impressed by the service, no matter where they encountered a waiter, they would say hello with a smile.I live in a benchmark. The room is quite large, but the bed is a bit hard, not very comfortable, and the breakfast is very average."
1,比较不错的酒店，设施比较新，交通还是比较方便，但是离市中心有一点距离，去机场方便。,"The more good hotels, the facilities are relatively new, and the transportation is still more convenient, but there is a little distance from the city center, which is convenient to go to the airport."
1,酒店的地理位置很好，与普宁寺只一墙之隔，环境也不错，很安静。房间比较干净，服务员态度也很好。,"The hotel's geographical location is very good, and it is only separated from the wall from Puning Temple. The environment is also good and quiet.The room is relatively clean and the waiter attitude is also very good."
0,价格太高，性价比不够好。我觉得今后还是去其他酒店比较好。,The price is too high and the price / performance ratio is not good enough.I think it is better to go to other hotels in the future.
0,很一般的酒店，紧临马路，虽然有双层窗，但还有些吵。平时价格应低于200元，节日价格380元属于过高。总体而言，很一般，包括服务。,"A very ordinary hotel, close to the road, although there are double -layer windows, but there is still some noisy.The price should be less than 200 yuan, and the festival price is 380 yuan.Overall, it is very general, including service."
0,"真的不怎么样的酒店,房间十分狭小,一股异味,卫生间简陋,虽然对于这样规格酒店不能要求太高.但是同样等级同样价格的速8就做的比这好多了,真后悔选择不一样的酒店作尝试.","There are really not many hotels. The room is very small, a odor, and the bathroom is simple. Although the hotel cannot be required too high for such specifications. However, the same level of the same level is much better than this.Try the hotel."
1,美仑大酒店我第2次去住了。首先需要肯定的是，客服布置非常不错，很高雅，尤其是床铺，特别舒服特别柔软。我特意掀开床罩开了一下，美伦酒店的床的床垫很有可能是特别定制的。床垫下方和上面都特别有一层软垫连在一起。所以睡上去才会这样舒服。特别赞一个。不过美中不足的是，美伦酒店的房件隔音有点问题。一般酒店房间隔音分为3部分，窗外隔音，走道门隔音和邻间隔音。前面两个没啥好讲的，窗外隔音不错。但问题出在邻间隔音上。美伦酒店的房间，两间之间有一部分是衣厨相连的，没有实心墙，衣厨一划两半，一半这间一半那间。只有薄薄的木板隔开。所以邻间隔音简直是恶梦！隔壁房间住人进来的讲话声，还有他们拉开衣服挂衣服衣架撞击厨壁，声音响得不得了。把我从午睡当中吵醒！如果你隔壁房间住了吵杂的人，那你简直就别想休息好。如果你想在房间“激情”一下，也请千万小心哦，隔壁会听到！交通方面一般，离地铁站较远。不过购物还好，出门就有乐购商场。另外特别赞一下，美伦的早餐自助餐，真是太棒了，样式特别丰富，而且特别好吃。档次很高！特别美味。来美仑住，一定要享受他们的早餐自助餐！顺便说一下，本人懂卫视。本人发现美伦的卫星电视貌似用了盗版卫星电视。因为根据国家法律，星级酒店用的是“统一平台”即134号卫星上的国家批准的落地平台，但我发现美伦只有HBO是“统一平台”上的HBO（带简体中文字幕），其他的境外台居然都是从146号菲律宾卫星上引下来的盗版台！cinemax不带中文字幕！还有CNN、BBC，都是从146号菲星上引下来的！这几天菲星上的台，底下都有菲律宾卫视商打上去的游动字幕广告（是奥运频道的广告），全都一字不漏出来了！我知道“统一平台”分配给酒店一般只有一张卡，但是，拜托，美仑的技术人员难道不知道有一种设备叫做“分卡器”吗？而且唯一的正版境外台HBO，还时有马赛克，看来美伦酒店对准134的天线没有完全对准哦。其他的还包括，马桶圈垫上有渍，叫服务员来看过，说是以前消毒剂留下来的痕迹。当着我的面再次消毒一次，那个痕迹确实消不掉。不过拜托，不能直接换掉马桶盖吗？又不贵！那个坐垫圈上消不掉的渍子真的好讨厌哦，估计每次入住的客人都会叫服务员过来看一下。美伦不嫌烦吗？另外我房间的电视遥控器按键有一个不灵。就是选台键，只有上翻，下翻键没反应。估计遥控器使用得时间太长内部已经不行了。另外宽带很贵，计时价，每分钟1元，100元封顶。虽然速度不错，但价钱不便宜哦,"Meilun Hotel I stayed for the second time.First of all, it is certain that the customer service layout is very good, very elegant, especially the bed, which is particularly comfortable and soft.I deliberately opened the bed cover and opened it. The mattress of the bed at the hotel is likely to be specially customized.There is a special layer of cushion under the mattress and above.It is so comfortable to sleep.Special praise.However, the disadvantage of the United States is that there is a problem with the sound insulation of the room at the United States.Generally, the sound insulation of hotel rooms is divided into 3 parts, sound insulation outside the window, sound insulation of the aisle door and neighboring.There is nothing to say in front of the two, sound insulation outside the window.But the problem lies in the neighbor's sound insulation.In the room of the Meiren Hotel, part of the two rooms were connected to the kitchen. There were no solid walls. The kitchen was in half, half of the room.Only thin wooden boards are separated.So neighboring sound insulation is a nightmare!The voice of the people who came in next door, and they pulled the clothes to hang clothes and hugged the kitchen wall, and the sound was terrible.Wake me up from a nap!If you live in a noisy person next door, then you just don't want to rest well.If you want to ""passion"" in the room, please be careful, you will hear next door!In terms of transportation, it is far from the subway station.However, shopping is okay, there will be a Tesco shopping mall when you go out.In addition, it is particularly praised that the breakfast buffet of the United States is really great, the style is particularly rich, and it is particularly delicious.High grade!Especially delicious.Come to Meilun, be sure to enjoy their breakfast buffet!By the way, I understand the TV.I found that the Satellite TV of the United States seemed to use pirated satellite TV.Because according to national laws, Star Hotel uses a ""unified platform"", that is, the national approval platform approved on the No. 134 satellite, but I find that the United States only has HBO is HBO (with simplified Chinese subtitles) on the ""unified platform"", othersThe overseas platforms are all pirated stations led from the Philippine satellite No. 146!Cinemax does not have Chinese subtitles!There are also CNN and BBC, which are leading from the Filiphaver No. 146!In the past few days, the Philippine Star has been under the Philippine Satellite TV merchants on the travel subtitle advertisement (it is an advertisement on the Olympic channel).I know that the ""Unified Platform"" is generally only one card allocated to the hotel. But, do you know that the technical staff of Meilun is called a device called a ""scorer""?And the only genuine overseas Taiwan HBO, there are also mosaic. It seems that the Mercedes Hotel is not fully aimed at the 134 antenna.Others include stains on the toilet ring, and called the waiter to see it, saying that it was the traces left by the previous disinfectant.Disinfeted again in front of my face, and that trace really couldn't dispel.But please, can't you change the toilet lid directly?Not expensive!The stains that can't be eliminated on the cushion circle are really annoying. It is estimated that the guests who stay in each time will call the waiter to see it.Isn't the United States bothering?In addition, the TV remote control button in my room has a unpopular button.It is the selection key, only the upper, the lower key did not respond.It is estimated that the remote control time is too long and internal.In addition, broadband is expensive, timing price, 1 yuan per minute, 100 yuan cap.Although the speed is good, the price is not cheap"
1,上个星期，订了两间高级房，只有这种房型才有两张床。订的时候忘记注明要双床的，但是要了四份早餐。后来，我的客人到了酒店，前台说：只订了一间大床房。我不知道携程是怎么跟圣廷苑沟通的，那天下着大雨，客人也不能转其他酒店，害我丢尽颜面。后来，携程的一个工作人员打电话过来，除了顶嘴什么事情也不能帮我解决。我认为：我订了四份早餐，虽然我忘记了说一定要双床的，可是携程也应该帮我确认一下，估计那天酒店生意好，就随便把我的房间订成大床房。后来，携程那个工作人员还说：你有可能带朋友来吃早餐才订四份早餐的，这很正常。我觉得这个服务态度也真是够差的，我一直在用携程网，现在已经是白金了，但是这样的服务态度我真的觉得很遗憾。,"Last week, two high -end houses were booked. Only this type of room type had two beds.I forgot to indicate the double bed when I order, but I asked for four breakfast.Later, my guests arrived at the hotel and said at the front desk: I only booked a big bed room.I do n’t know how Ctrip communicates with San Tingyuan. When it was raining that day, the guests could not transfer to other hotels, causing me to lose face.Later, a staff member of Ctrip called to call, and it couldn't help me solve it except the whisper.I think: I booked four breakfast. Although I forgot to say that I must double bed, Ctrip should also help me confirm. It is estimated that the hotel business was good that day, so I just ordered my room into a large bed room.Later, the staff member of Ctrip also said: You may bring friends to eat breakfast before ordering four breakfast, which is normal.I think this service attitude is really bad. I have been using Ctrip.com. Now I am already a platinum, but I really feel regrettable for such a service attitude."
1,地理位置很好，在南湖旁边，透过房间的窗户就能看到南湖，很是写意。酒店的服务也不错，就是酒店的地毯看上去太脏了,"The geographical location is very good. Next to the South Lake, the South Lake can be seen through the window of the room, which is very freehand.The hotel's service is also good, that is, the carpet of the hotel looks too dirty"
1,酒店外部环境很不错，感觉很静谧，房间内部装修尚可，但房间隔音不好，屋内面积有些拥挤。,"The outside environment of the hotel is very good, it feels very quiet, the interior of the room is acceptable, but the room is not well inspired, and the area of the house is a bit crowded."
1,我入住的是酒店豪华单人房，酒店房间设施基本满意，就是卫生间浴池上掉墙皮，而且热水放一会才热，早餐在22楼观光餐厅，丰富服务周到，比较满意~~,"I stayed in the hotel luxury single room. The hotel room facilities were basically satisfactory, that is, the wall skin was dropped on the bathroom bath, and the hot water was hot for a while to get hot. Breakfast was on the 22nd floor sightseeing restaurant."
1,主楼房间不错，副楼就差了很多，早餐很好，推荐入住,"The main building room is good, the auxiliary building is much worse, breakfast is very good, it is recommended to check in"
1,酒店设施一流，房间设施一流，前台及销售人员服务非常令人满意，我因为是陪同客人去旅游，旅游路线不了解，询问了酒店总台，总台马上安排酒店销售人员热情为我一一解答，销售人员还提出如有需要可以陪同我们一起前往旅游景点，让人有宾至如归的感觉真的非常不错，但美中不足的是酒店的早餐，我一共入住酒店2次，每次早上我大约都在9点去餐厅用早餐（9：30结束），但是每次都是没有什么可以吃的了，每次都有很多客人都在向服务员抱怨，而服务员也没有作出进一步的反应，我觉得这与五星级的酒店不太相忖，希望酒店能予以改进。,"The hotel facilities are first -rate, the room facilities are first -class, and the service of the front desk and sales staff is very satisfactory. I did not understand the travel route because I accompanied the guests. I asked the hotel head station.The sales staff also proposed that if necessary, we can accompany us to the tourist attraction, which makes people feel that the guest is really good, but the shortcoming is the breakfast of the hotel. I stay in the hotel 2 times in total. I am about 9 in the morning.Click to go to the restaurant for breakfast (ends at 9:30), but there is nothing to eat every time. Many guests are complaining to the waiter every time, and the waiter has not responded further. I think this is from five.Star hotels are not very good, I hope the hotel can be improved."
0,唉！这个酒店真是让我失望！！！上次住就感觉不好，这次去发现床上竟然有JB毛儿！不说什么了，希望携程努力控制酒店的档次！,"well!This hotel really disappointed me!IntersectionIntersectionI didn't feel good last time I lived. This time I found that there were JB Mao on the bed!Don't say anything, I hope Ctrip will work hard to control the hotel's grade!"
0,"酒店设施不错.但位置太偏.等有到出租车非常不方便,让门童邦叫第二天早上邦叫一出租竞收我十元手续费.还有西餐厅实在太差.点的西餐做出来吃都不能吃后面叫来厨师自己都说不是正宗西餐.让人难以接受,而且价格同其他酒店一样高下次决不可选这种酒店","The hotel facilities are good. But the location is too biased. It is very inconvenient to wait for the taxi to let the door Tongbang call the Bangbang for rent to collect my ten yuan handling fee. There is a western restaurant.If you do it, you ca n’t eat it after you eat it. After you call the chef, you say that it ’s not an authentic Western food. It is difficult to accept, and the price is as high as other hotels."
1,优点：酒店周边环境比较好，湖景房窗外的风景确实挺漂亮的，服务也还算及时。缺点：外面看起来很不错，但是房间里的设施很旧，隔音效果很差，前台收银员的业务能力也非常需要培训。,"Advantages: The surrounding environment of the hotel is better. The scenery outside the lake view room is really beautiful, and the service is pretty time.Disadvantages: It looks very good outside, but the facilities in the room are very old, the sound insulation effect is poor, and the business ability of the front desk cashier also needs training."
0,设施是很一般，但是服务人员的态度不敢恭维的。早饭很差，一大群服务员乱哄哄围在一起，就是没有一个人理你,"The facilities are very average, but the attitude of the service staff dares not to be complimented.Breakfast is very poor, a large group of waiters are coaxing around, but no one cares about you"
1,地段比较好，上高速公路方便！房间大设施齐全，卫生间比较舒适实用，床上用品干净，送一张2007版江西旅游地图非常好！就是地毯有点旧！,"The location is better, and the highway is convenient!The large rooms are complete, the bathroom is relatively comfortable and practical, and the bedding is clean. It is very good to send a 2007 version of Jiangxi tourist map!The carpet is a bit old!"
1,早餐真的太差了！！！房间设施还可以，就是临街一面太吵了,"Breakfast is really bad!IntersectionIntersectionThe room facilities are okay, but the street is too noisy"
1,观景大床房，住了2晚。酒店位置很好，距离虹桥机场只有不到10公里，出行、叫车都算方便。据说是人大培训用的酒店，三星标准。服务还可以，但是洗手间设施比较陈旧，淋浴间的下水不太通畅，毛巾也是很旧的样子。,"Observation big bed room, lived for 2 nights.The hotel location is very good. It is only less than 10 kilometers from Hongqiao Airport. It is convenient to travel and call a car.It is said to be a hotel for training for the National People's Congress, Samsung Standard.The service is okay, but the facilities of the bathroom are relatively old. The launch of the shower room is not smooth, and the towels are very old."
1,"住过无数次,外观看上去像布达拉宫，里面设施一般，有点老，现在携程的价格是310，如果去前台，6楼以下的房间是260，这个价格携程没有登出来。早餐不是很好，自助的，但是菜很少，而且都是中式的，以山东菜式为主，口味比较重，不是很习惯。房间里面有2瓶免费的矿泉水，但是有的房间没有，如果没有话，可以和总台要，所有人员的服务态度都很好，这点比较赞。酒店的大门比较靠里，如果要打车的话，要走400-500米左右。","I have lived countless times, and the appearance looks like the Potala Palace. The facilities inside are a bit old. Now the price of Ctrip is 310. If you go to the front desk, the room below the 6th floor is 260. This price Ctrip did not log in.Breakfast is not very good, buffet, but there are few dishes, and they are all Chinese. They are mainly Shandong dishes. The taste is relatively heavy and not very used to it.There are 2 bottles of free mineral water in the room, but some rooms are not. If there are no words, you can ask the head office. The service attitude of all personnel is very good. This is more praised.The door of the hotel is more dependent. If you want to take a taxi, you need to take about 400-500 meters."
1,房间很不错，到底是在比较偏僻的九龙城，所以房间就是比市区里面的大上好多。如果不是时间很赶的游客，推荐这家酒店。就是要考虑到每天都会增加12元港币的小巴费用。,"The room is very good. In the end, it is relatively remote Kowloon City, so the room is much larger than in the city.If it is not a tourist who is very time, I recommend this hotel.It is necessary to consider the cost of a small bus of HK $ 12 a day."
0,网速快，且方便VPN连到公司内部网，IT负责人把网络设置得不错，表扬一下。但前台服务员态度达不到满意的标准。酒店没有熨斗，因要见客户，只得拜托熨一件衬衫，说了5块，结帐时却要价8块，说是服务费和加急费要3块。打开玻璃淋浴间的门，才发觉右手至少要有2米长才可够得着浴巾，只好滴着水出来拿。琢磨了一下，浴巾也不能带进小小的淋浴间呀，不知谁设计的。没找到比其他宾馆更多的优点，560块大洋花得有点冤，不再来了。,"The network speed is fast, and it is convenient for VPN to connect to the company's internal network. The person in charge of IT set the network well and praise it.But the front desk waiter's attitude cannot meet the satisfactory standard.There is no iron in the hotel. Because I want to see customers, I have to ask for an iron shirt. I said 5 yuan, but the price was 8 yuan at the checkout.Opening the door of the glass shower room, I found that the right hand had at least 2 meters long to get a bath towel, so I had to drip the water to get it out.After pondering, the towel can't be brought into a small shower room, I don't know who designed it.I did not find more advantages than other hotels. The 560 ocean was a bit injustice and no longer came."
0,入住时间：3月28日晚；交通：距市中心和临时火车站都不近，虽然门口就有公交车，但车次少、时间长。走300米有地铁。周围环境：门前的马路好像新修过的但又没有修完，感觉七扭八歪、乱七八糟。周围非常偏，什么都没有，超市、餐馆什么的通通都没有，能看到的就只有工地和一座荒了的清真寺（很久没人的样子）。空气很不好，还有扬尘，幸好入住那天下小雨，不然风沙会更大。装修：以前住过别的快捷酒店，装修风格和质量都比如家的强，同价位的房间也比如家的大，对比之下，觉得如家的性价比不高。配置：还算齐全。电视可以收到湖南卫视，但信号偶尔会有断掉的情况出现。有小饮水机，但水不多。差评：1、不知道如家是不是都这样，反正他家浴室的地面特别滑！我洗澡时就被滑倒了，因为摔得不重才没有投诉！那地板根本就不防滑，一沾水就像踩了油一样！！,"Checking time: On the evening of March 28; Transportation: It is not close to the city center and temporary railway stations. Although there are buses at the door, there are fewer trains and long time.Walk 300 meters for subway.The surrounding environment: The road in front of the door seems to be new but not finished. It feels twisted and crooked.There are very biased around, there is nothing, there is nothing in the supermarket or restaurant. The only thing that can be seen is the construction site and a deserted mosque (no one looks like a long time).The air is very bad, and there is dust. Fortunately, it is raining in the world that day, otherwise the wind and sand will be greater.Decoration: I have lived in other shortcut hotels before.

0,预定中午12点入住，中午11点半左右到，告知房间正在清理。心想，清理房间能用多少时间呀，于是耐心等待。哪知，12：30再次询问房间仍然没有清理好，急了催问到底几时可以入住，告知40分钟以后，差点晕倒。,"Stop to live at 12 noon, and arrive at around 11:30 noon, and inform the room being cleaned.I thought, how much time to clean up the room, so I waited patiently.I did n’t know, 12:30 asked the room again that the room was still not cleaned up. When I was anxious, I could check in, and I almost fainted after 40 minutes."
1,"满不错的，而且客房服务不错的,我走的时候忘拿相机,酒店专门找到我们的领队让我去取,等我上到我住的那一层,服务员已经在等待我去取了!不过不足的就是感觉床上有些潮,可能跟当地的天气有关!还有,吃的我们一起去的4个人都认为在严州府对面的街的对面(嘿嘿),有一家私营的土菜馆,味道相当的好,很新鲜,而且便宜,量也很足,老板娘很实在,推荐去那里","Full of good, and the guest room service is good. When I left, I forgot to take the camera. The hotel specifically found our leader and asked me to get it. When I went to the layer I lived, the waiter was waiting for me to pick it up! ButThe disadvantage is that there is some tide on the bed, which may be related to the local weather! Also, the 4 people who eat together thinks that the street opposite the street opposite Yanzhou Prefecture (hehe), there is a private native restaurant, which tastes quite tasteful.Good, very fresh, cheap, and enough quantity. The boss is very real. It is recommended to go there."
0,这是一家相当烂的酒店，我不知道其他人是如何评价它的，对客户那种极不信任的表情以及工作作风，自以为是，狂妄自大，肆意欺骗顾客，他们根本就没把客户放在眼里，我奉劝看过此贴的朋友，千万不要住这家黑店啊！切记！！！,"This is a very bad hotel. I don't know how others evaluate it.

I have been tortured without power to adjust the room.Want to lie on the bed to watch TV, my god!I can't see it!In short, I am more satisfied with this Ctrip's service, and I am particularly not satisfied with the guest room services provided by Xinhu City Hotel in Shenyang City, Liaoning Province!I hope Ctrip can think about our joining hotels, and always how we believe in brands such as Ctrip.Overall I am very depressed!Special sad!"
1,豪华标间房间比较大，价格也比较合适，环境也干净，还有水果送。设施比较齐全，还有直饮水。去各个景点也比较方便。早餐品种挺丰富的。整体还是比较满意的。再说说不好的，卫生间淋浴房和卫生间房门的开向不合理，两个门一开卫生间就没空间了，很容易磕磕碰碰，最好把淋浴房改成移门。靠立交桥的房间晚上有点吵。,"The luxury room room is relatively large, the price is also suitable, the environment is clean, and the fruit is delivered.The facilities are relatively complete, and there are direct drinking water.It's more convenient to go to various attractions.Breakfast varieties are very rich.The overall is relatively satisfactory.Besides, it ’s not good.

0,从永州回到长沙，由于是学生返回的高峰期，酒店需要信用卡担保，但是由于我丢了钱包还没有补办好，因此只有到酒店前台进行确认有无房间。到了前台服务人员告知有房间，通过携程预定后，但是前台小姐的脸色又非常不好看了，直接告诉我，办理办理一张他们的酒店卡，比携程的方便（我靠，我又不是傻子），这个时候有一个客人来了，小姐依然用同样的话告诉他，这个客户同意了，我就在旁边看，结果和我预定是相同的房间，的确便宜20元，但是根本没有给这个客户一张会员卡，然后这个服务元很傲气地斜眼看了我，但是那个郁闷哦！又在大厅等待了20分钟，多次催促小姐去拿传真，根本不理睬你，最后我发飙要向长沙旅游局投诉，这才给我办理手续（该前台服务员姓刘）。由于上次入住没有了经验，我这次要求楼层要高，而且不能够窗户对准51大道，避免吵闹，给我了1820号房间，进去感觉房间比上次的8901房间好一些，但是窗帘关闭不严的毛病依然存在。第二天从客户那里回来，已经是晚上8点多了，打开房间一看，结果发现依然没有打扫，呵呵，我感觉这家酒店对携程的客户估计当作二等房客来对待的，希望携程和这个酒店好好沟通一下。,"Back to Changsha from Yongzhou, because it was a peak period for students to return, the hotel needs a credit card guarantee, but because I lost my wallet, I did not make up for it, so I only went to the front desk of the hotel to confirm whether there was a room.When the front desk service staff informed the room, after the Ctrip was booked, but the face of the front desk lady was very unsightly, and told me directly to apply for a hotel card, which is more convenient than Ctrip (I rely on, I am not a fool)At this time, a guest came, and the lady still told him in the same words that the customer agreed, and I was watching it. As a result, I was in the same room as I was scheduled.Member card, then the service Yuan looked at me proudly, but that depression!After waiting in the lobby for 20 minutes, I urged the lady to get faxes many times. I ignored you at all. In the end, I will complain to the Changsha Tourism Bureau, so I will go through the procedures (the front desk waiter is Liu).Since there is no experience in the last time I staying, I asked the floor to be high, and the windows could not be accommodated to 51 Avenue to avoid noise. I gave me room 1820.Not strict faults still exist.I came back from the customer the next day. It was already more than 8 o'clock in the evening. I opened the room and saw that I still didn't clean it. Hehe, I feel that the hotel is expected to be treated as a second -class tenant.Communicate with this hotel."

1,看了网友的点评才去的，确实不错。环境不错，紧靠大海，宾馆游泳池也不错，服务更不错，很象海南，泰国等地的服务，都是微笑服务，住宿也不需要押金，CHECKIN/OUT都很快；就是住的迎宾楼的房子，没有大堂；另外淋浴房设计好像有问题，站着冲的话水会从里面流出来，弄地满地都是。。。,"It was really good after watching the comments from netizens.The environment is good, close to the sea, the hotel's swimming pool is also good, the service is more good, it is like Hainan, Thailand and other places, all smile services, accommodation does not require deposit, Checkin/OUT is fast;The house has no lobby; in addition, the design of the shower room seems to have problems.

1,"房间的设施不是特别好,但环境十分安静舒适,服务态度非常好.唯一不好的就是离正街有点远,约2.5KM","The facilities in the room are not particularly good, but the environment is very quiet and comfortable, and the service attitude is very good. The only bad thing is that it is a bit far from Zhengjie, about 2.5km"
0,"本来预定的就是别墅标间,前台小姐很热情的给我们推荐了""超超豪华的普通标间""给我们入住,说是比我本来网络上预定的还要好，进去就是一股异味,好象是几百年没人住过的老式里弄,我们后来还是强烈要求酒店给我们原本预定的别墅房间,的确就不一样了，但是这样一来给我们的感觉非常不好,我想这也是酒店的手段吧.","The preservation was the villa standard room.

1,一般，一般还是一般，但是服务员比较诚信，收订金是多付了200元，服务员马上电话到房间告知，比较诚信。,"Generally, it is generally average, but the waiter is more honest, and the deposit pays more than 200 yuan. The waiter immediately phone to the room to inform, which is more honest."
0,本人是看了其他客户点评决定预定此酒店的，但是到了酒店感到非常失望，一点也没有酒店气氛，正如其他点评所说“就一招待所”。服务员没有穿制服，好像是家庭作坊式管理，整个酒店也是冷冰冰的，空调开到30度一点也不感觉暖和，晚上加了床毯子还感觉冷。早餐就一个字“烂”，从未见过如此差的早餐，我8点去稀饭都没了，问大妈（注意：是大妈，就是穿着围裙的那种），答曰“没有了”，一点服务意识也没有。大厅里还恶俗地摆了个财神像，并且烟雾缭绕。强烈建议大家不要入住次此酒店。春节期间酒店特价房168元和198元，到了问总台都有房间。协程对应的价格是240元和280元，预定要压信用卡，不能取消。,"I saw other customers' reviews and decided to book the hotel, but when I arrived at the hotel, I felt very disappointed. There was no hotel atmosphere at all. As other comments said, ""Just a hire.""The waiter did not wear uniforms. It seemed to be managed by family workshops. The entire hotel was cold. The air conditioner was not warm to 30 degrees. It felt cold when I added bed blankets at night.There is no service consciousness.There was a vulgar statue in the hall, and smoke was dazzling.It is strongly recommended that you do not stay in this hotel.During the Spring Festival, the hotel special houses were 168 yuan and 198 yuan. At the time of the question, there were rooms in the main station.The corresponding price of the coroutine is 240 yuan and 280 yuan, and the credit card is scheduled to be scheduled to be canceled."
1,今天刚从三亚飞回来，住这家酒店是前天晚上。酒店正在搞基建，没看到游泳池，没看到新房子，没看到客人――门口倒是停了两辆旅行社的大巴。酒店里海边还有一段不短的距离，碰巧所在的小路正在整修，断了直达的路，只好绕远，当是散步好了。a.确实是亚龙湾一带最便宜的酒店，本人入住的是6号楼的623，最便宜的标准间。进门有点霉味，可能是因为最近在搞基建，酒店没有完全对外开放吧？！不过开窗透透气马上没有了，房间可以直接看到内湖，风很大，空气对流很好。特别要说的是，房间很大哟，尤其以洗漱间为最啊，那个大啊，可以用来当客房了。洗澡水也很好，住了不洗，绝对是你的损失！b.餐厅似乎最近没有营业，最近的海鲜大排挡，绝对是宰你没商量！慎重慎重，带包方便面吧，你会感谢我的~~~~~~c.离海边较远，如果自己有车，则完全没有问题；若实在没有，酒店有租自行车，所以至少请务必会骑自行车；两个条件都不具备，剩下的只有text，起步价5元，2分钟到，想想觉得实在划不来啊！d.特别想要谢谢酒店的某位先生，不知道是不是老板。我们一家提着行李到了酒店附近，找不到方向，酒店马上安排了人过来接我们。漂亮的小轿车，司机不像只是普通员工，倒像是老板，又或者是“高层”，人很好，所以――谢谢！！基建期间，周围很吵――当然只是白天，且交通不便，房子看上去确实较陈旧，不过整体来说还是满意的，待装修过后，情况应该会改善，不过价格会不会变动就不知道咯！！,"I just returned from Sanya today, and staying at this hotel was the night before.The hotel was engaged in infrastructure, did not see the swimming pool, did not see a new house, and did not see the guests -the bus stopped at the door.There is also a short distance on the seaside in the hotel. It happens that the path where it is located is renovating, and the straight road is broken, so you have to go around, when it is a walk.a. It is indeed the cheapest hotel in the area of Yalong Bay.

0,酒店位于市中心，比较方便，房间设施较一般，最苦恼的是，说是市政府规定，室外温度不过27度就不能开空调，所以白天几乎不开空调，热得我们没处躲，要知道这可是宾馆不是招待所，房间都是不对流的，不开空调能闷死人呢，真难受啊，还好到晚上空调开了，不然我就立马退房走人了。本市的地图是要买的，不像别的酒店都有赠送。,"The hotel is located in the center of the city. It is more convenient. The room facilities are relatively average. The most distressed thing is that the municipal government stipulates that the outdoor temperature cannot be turned on the air conditioner at 27 degrees, so there is almost no air conditioner during the day.This is that the hotel is not a guest house. The rooms are not right. It is uncomfortable not to open the air conditioner. Fortunately, the air conditioner is turned on at night, otherwise I will immediately check out.The map of this city is to be bought, unlike other hotels."

1,好的地方前面的朋友都说了许多，这里就不再重复了，但有些东西还是要分享给大家：宽带收费是按照11.5元/小时收费的，你一天挂24小时就收24小时，这种收费方式还是第一次遇见；闭路电视的信号实在糟糕，有不少频道都飘满“雪花”。不过该酒店在皇冠假日中应该算是性价比较高的酒店之一了，下次去湛江还会入住，前提是别涨价了。,"Friends in front of the good places have said a lot, and I won't repeat it here, but some things still have to be shared with everyone: Broadband charges are charged at 11.5 yuan/h. You can collect 24 hours a day for 24 hours.The charging method is the first time to meet; the signal of CCTV is really bad, and many channels are covered with ""snowflakes"".However, the hotel should be one of the most cost -effective hotels in the Crown Holiday.

1,地理位置极好，性价比很高。虽然房间稍旧，但也算三星强了，能抵上一些四星的宾馆了。,"The geographical location is excellent and the price is very high.Although the room is slightly old, it is also stronger, and it can reach some four -star hotels."
1,条件还可以，服务不错，酒店人员态度很好，早餐尚可。但总体感觉携程的价格略贵，比很多公司的协议价格都贵，这不大符合携程的地位啊。,"The conditions are okay, the service is good, the hotel staff is very good, and breakfast is okay.But in general, I feel that Ctrip's price is slightly expensive, and the price of many companies is expensive. This is not in line with the status of Ctrip."
1,服务很亲切，热心。我们很晚才到，值班的老周电话引导我们停到比较近的停车场，还出来带我们，当晚挺冷的。晚上到达有点冷清，只有走廊的红灯笼，走在中式建筑的厅廊之间，是有点怕怕的。但白天看来，非常清雅，早餐不多但亲切清爽。下午逛累了，在大厅坐会再上路像回到自己家一样自在舒服。整体而言，满意。若能明确引导开车路线的话就更好了。,"The service is very kind and enthusiastic.We only arrived late. Lao Zhou on duty guided us to stop to the relatively close parking lot and came out to take us. It was very cold that night.It was a bit deserted in the evening.

1,当天由于订不到淄博最好的两家酒店，由于时间比较晚了，后来就订在了这里，但是结果却让我们觉得非常满意，性价比很高，所处地理位置好，酒店挺大，房间也不错，服务也好，设备和附属设施都挺齐全的，早餐没起得来，没吃过，但在餐厅吃了几顿，食物基本上都还不错，价格也不贵（就是豆浆很贵的说！），服务员满可爱，特地多住了两天。就是商场的东西比其他高级酒店要黑很多，比标签价格还贵了不少。听朋友介绍说新开业的万豪不错，价格也不贵，下次对比一下，看哪家更好，性价比高，以后就住那一家了。,"Due to the two best hotels in Zibo that day, because the time was relatively late, it was booked here later, but the result made us feel very satisfied. The cost performance is very high.It is also good, the service is good, the equipment and the auxiliary facilities are quite complete. Breakfast has not been got up, and has not been eaten, but after eating a few meals in the restaurant, the food is basically good, and the price is not expensive (that is, soy milk is expensive.Say!), The waiter was cute and lived for two more days.That is, the shopping mall is much darker than other high -end hotels, and it is much more expensive than the label price.I listened to friends and said that the newly opened Marriott is good, and the price is not expensive. The next time I compare it, which one is better and the price is high. I will live in that family in the future."

1,朝南豪华房可以看海，房间很干净，设施也不错，但就是比较小，两个人在里面就有点转不开身，网速非常快。前台接待业务不精，入住离开时前台都有出错，服务水平有待提高。自助餐厅一般，78元一客价格也不低。周边环境不错，选择住在这里是正是因为到海边很近，离啤酒城也不过两条街的距离。吃饭到云霄路需要开车过去，不过还是挺方便，像前面网友所说，自驾游推荐入住。,"You can look at the sea in the South luxury room. The room is very clean and the facilities are good, but they are relatively small. The two people are a bit unable to turn their body, and the speed of the internet speed is very fast.The front desk reception business is not fine, and the front desk is wrong when check -in, and the service level needs to be improved.The buffet restaurant is average, and the price of 78 yuan is not low.The surrounding environment is good. Choosing to live here is because it is very close to the seaside, and it is not the distance between the two streets from the beer city.It is necessary to drive to Yunxiao Road, but it is still very convenient. As the netizens said, self -driving tour is recommended to check in."

1,参加展会的首选！从机场坐磁悬浮到龙阳站下了再往前走500米就到了，记得06年参加展会时，在龙阳站下车后，打的没人愿意拉（现在才知道原因），后来有个人拉了，不知绕到什么地方后又绕回来，怎么各地的司机给人的感觉都一个样呢？,"Participate in the exhibition's first choice!From the airport to the magnetic suspended to the Longyang Station, it will be 500 meters forward. Remember that when I got off at the exhibition in 2006, no one was willing to pull it after getting off at Longyang Station (now I know the reason).I pulled it, I do n’t know where to go back and go back, why do drivers everywhere feel the same?"
1,经常出差在外，住了很多酒店，无锡木棉花真的不错，前台的接待服务员都很平易近人，尤其是秦经理，让客人有种回家的感觉。宾馆反馈2008年8月12日：相信有了您的认同和肯定，我们的服务会更上一层楼，代转秦小姐对您的谢意，酒店全体员工期待你早日回家！！呵呵！！,"I often travel outside and live in a lot of hotels. Wuxi kaptales are really good. The reception waiters at the front desk are very approachable, especially Manager Qin, so that guests feel like going home.Hotel feedback on August 12, 2008: I believe that with your recognition and affirmation, our service will be on the next level. On behalf of Miss Qin, all employees of the hotel are looking forward to your early home!Intersectionhehe!Intersection"
1,这家酒店还不错，房间比较干净，服务也还不错，性价比较高，推荐！,"This hotel is not bad, the room is relatively clean, the service is not bad, the cost is relatively high, it is recommended!"
1,前台服务不错，主动向客人介绍酒店设施，checkin&out速度也比较快，不足之处，淋浴出水量比较小。,"The front desk service is good, and the hotel facilities actively introduce the hotel facilities. The Checkin & OUT speed is also relatively fast."
1,酒店本身是没得说，就是每次CHECKIN都需要等至少30分钟以上，总是－被告知“正在清理”，不过因为酒店位置方便客人出入的关系，多数是会订这家酒店的。,"The hotel itself did not have to say that every time Checkin needs to wait at least 30 minutes, it is always told that ""is cleaning up"", but because the hotel location is convenient for guests to enter and exit, most of them will book this hotel."
1,由于公司就在旁边，这是我在香港住的最多的酒店，总体感觉非常的好，无论是硬件还是软件都无可挑剔，房间看出去一半是山一半是海，美不胜收。,"Since the company is next to it, this is the most hotel I live in Hong Kong. The overall feels very good. Both the hardware and the software are impeccable. The rooms see that half of the mountain is half the sea and the sea is beautiful."
1,"服务态度尚可;房间硬件较老;酒店外部环境不错,空气清新,安静.坐落在山坡上.","The service attitude is acceptable; the room's hardware is older; the external environment of the hotel is good, the air is fresh, quiet. Located on the hillside."
1,酒店整体还不错，就是地段指引比较差，找一些酒店内的设施问好几个人才找到。比如游泳场就让我找半天，太偏了,"The hotel as a whole is not bad, that is, the guidance of the location is relatively poor. Find some facilities in the hotel to ask several talents to find.For example, let me find it for a long time."
1,酒店房间设施不错，服务太差（也许是主要服务团体会议的原因，对个人不是服务很热情）。跟携程要求不是一楼，去房间一看还是一楼。地理位置不好，要出租车很不方便，叫车￥20起单程。大理包一天车才￥150（13988505869李，我们用了两天，服务很好。）。不过泡着温泉，也不是太想计较。,"The hotel room facilities are good and the service is too poor (perhaps the reason for the main service group meeting, which is not enthusiastic about individuals).The request of Ctrip is not the first floor. Going to the room is still the first floor.The geographical location is not good. It is inconvenient to taxi.The Dali bag was only ￥ 150 a day (13988505869 Li, we used it for two days, and the service was very good.).But soaking in the hot spring, I don't want to care about it."
1,这次去北京，是要去北师大办事，所以特意留意了下附近的宾馆。住了两天，首先该宾馆很好找，离西四大街很近，公交车护国寺站下步行两分钟就到。因离公交站近，去哪坐公交都方便，很省钱省事。宾馆外有很多小吃店，价位比王府井小吃街要便宜，护国寺街上报刊厅、2毛一分钟的公用长途电话、水果摊、24小时便利店、网吧应有尽有，很方便。房间很干净，在这方面，在北京住过的几个三星级的还不如这家二星级的。房间暖气也开得足够，缺点就是冲澡时水温太低，而且忽冷忽热，不知道是什么原因。卫生间的插座不能充电，窗头柜下没插座，所以只能在电视机柜后充电，不太方便。另宾馆对面的烟酒店里的烟不能买，多是假的。宾馆服务员都很热情，让人感觉很好。推荐一个！,"This time I went to Beijing to go to Beijing Normal University, so I paid attention to the hotel nearby.After staying for two days, the hotel is very easy to find, which is very close to West Fourth Street.Because it is close to the bus stop, it is convenient to go to the bus, which is very money.There are many snack bars outside the hotel. The price is cheaper than Wangfujing Snack Street. The newspaper hall on Temple Street, the public long -distance telephone, fruit stall, 24 -hour convenience store, and Internet cafes are very convenient.The room is very clean. In this regard, several three -stars in Beijing are not as good as this two -star.The room heating is also high enough. The disadvantage is that the water temperature is too low during bathing, and it is cold and hot. I don't know why.The toilet socket cannot be charged, and there is no socket under the window cabinet, so it can only be charged behind the TV cabinet, which is not convenient.The smoke in the cigarette hotel opposite the hotel cannot be bought, and it is mostly fake.The hotel waiters are very enthusiastic and make people feel good.Recommend one!"
0,档次太低，房间太小，设施太差，一台电梯。,"The grade is too low, the room is too small, the facilities are too poor, and a elevator."
1,酒店的地理位置尚可，顺着情侣路很容易找到。定的是三人房，典型的２房１厅，房间偏小，厅不错。设施一般，只是电视频道非常多。HBO、BBC、成人电影台都有应该说３人房的价格还是比较有优势的,"The geographical location of the hotel is acceptable, and it is easy to find along the couple's road.The three -person room is set, a typical 2 -bedroom and 1 living room. The room is small and the hall is good.The facilities are average, but there are only a lot of TV channels.HBO, BBC, and adult movie table should say that the price of the three -person room is still relatively advantageous"
1,服务尚好，早餐比较差；距火车站很近，交通便利；只是携程价与前台价相差只有5元，没有太大的竞争力。补充点评2007年11月30日：有电话骚扰。如果你不接会一直打到晚上12点！！,"The service is still good, breakfast is worse; it is very close to the railway station and convenient transportation; just Ctrip's price is only 5 yuan and the front desk price is only 5 yuan, and there is not much competitiveness.Supplementary reviews November 30, 2007: There are phone harassment.If you don't pick it up until 12pm!Intersection"
1,该酒店的地理位置很不错（出门左拐就是漕宝路），出门打车也很方便（地铁稍稍远一点，大约一站路），服务员的态度也相当热情，早餐的性价比较高，值得推荐！！宾馆反馈2008年5月20日：尊敬的宾客：您好！感谢您给予酒店这么高的评价，酒店会以此激励每位员工做的更好，您的评价是对我们服务最好的肯定。谢谢！希望您的再次光临及更多的建议。,"The hotel's geographical location is very good (the left abduction is Caobao Road), and it is also convenient to go out to take a taxi (the subway is slightly farther, about a stop of the road), the waiter's attitude is also quite enthusiastic, the cost of breakfast is relatively high, it is worth recommending!IntersectionHotel feedback on May 20, 2008: Dear guest: Hello!Thank you for giving the hotel such a high evaluation. The hotel will inspire each employee to do better. Your evaluation is the best affirmation of our service.Thanks!I hope your visit and more suggestions."
1,"外面不太起眼,里边装修尚可.住的是塌塌米式,比较新奇.但是问题是房间内居然没有免费的赠水,有一小桶装纯净水不管喝多少,开封即6元,这是很大的问题.","It is not very eye -catching outside, the decoration inside is acceptable. It is a collapsed rice style, which is relatively new. But the problem is that there are no free water gifts in the room.A big problem."
1,"刚从丽江回来,感觉酒店在各方面都还不错,服务员很热情周到,每天还有水果、矿泉水赠送。早餐也比较丰富。唯一一点就是房间不隔音,楼上有人走路的话,整个房间都在响,所以睡得一点都不香,好像这边的酒店都是木制结构,估计都差不多","I just came back from Lijiang, I felt that the hotel was good in all aspects. The waiters were very enthusiastic and thoughtful. There were also fruits and mineral water.Breakfast is also richer.The only point is that the room is not sound insulation. If someone walks upstairs, the whole room is rang, so it is not fragrant at all. It seems that the hotels here are all wooden structures."
1,"不错的酒店,装修和风格都很好,是郑州最好的酒店了.可惜没有时间好好住,因为是晚上到了都一点半了.早上八点半又开车走了,所以只觉得房间很舒服,早餐很好吃哈哈哈哈.........","Good hotels, the decoration and style are very good, it is the best hotel in Zhengzhou. Unfortunately, there is no time to live well, because it is one and a past at night. At 8:30 in the morning, I only feel that the room is very comfortable.The breakfast is delicious hahahaha ............"
0,酒店周围倒是很安静，偶尔还有出租车停近院子。酒店比较旧。早餐很早就结束了，好像9点吧，感觉每天都要赶时间去吃早餐。,"The hotel is very quiet, and occasionally a taxi stops the courtyard.The hotel is older.Breakfast ended very early, it seems to be 9 o'clock. I feel that I have to hurry to eat breakfast every day."
0,住过这么多酒店，从来没有住过这么小旧脏老臭的“大床房”！一进门就被一股臭味熏了出来，开了一天的窗户也不见减少多少。洗手间又小又脏，恶心死了！我和老公从进门开始，就只能一个在床上，一个才有站在地上的空间！唯一的好处：地点不错，下楼就是商业街，很热闹，晚上还有小吃，就在楼下，距大相国寺和山陕甘会馆也不远，走路即可。不过，对小吃的期望值千万不要太高，以免有上当受骗的感觉。价格姑且不论，卫生是实在没有办法入眼的。,"I have lived in so many hotels and never lived in such a ""big bed room"" with so small and dirty and smelly!As soon as I entered the door, I was smoked from a smell, and the windows that opened a day did not see much.The bathroom is small and dirty, and disgusting!My husband and I have only one in bed, and one can have space on the ground!The only benefit: the location is good, the downstairs is the commercial street, which is very lively. At night, there are snacks, just downstairs, not far from Daxiangguo Temple and Shan, Shaanxi and Gansu Club, you can walk.However, do not have too high expectations for snacks, so as not to feel deceived.Regardless of the price, hygiene is really inconspicuous."

1,比较喜欢这家酒店，在天河北办事住这太方便了！早餐不错哦！,"I prefer this hotel, which is too convenient to work in Hebei!Breakfast is good!"
1,中餐厅绝对不是五星：晚8点多时去的2楼中餐厅，没什么人用餐，餐厅环境犹如一般小店，餐具也很一般，桌上没有餐巾纸，没有牙签。上菜也慢。,The Chinese restaurant is definitely not a five -star: the Chinese restaurant on the second floor at 8 o'clock in the evening. No one dine. The restaurant environment is like a small shop. The tableware is also very ordinary. There are no napkins on the table and no toothpicks.Slow food.
1,"房间是今年新装的，很不错。服务好，有接送服务，接送人员很热情，给客人感觉不错。结帐时提出改水单，每次都说系统不支持，但每次最后都是改过来了。这点不太满意，希望服务员在说“NO”之前先考虑一下，设法为客人解决问题。订票服务不知道是否归酒店管，感觉服务跟酒店整体水平有一定差距。宾馆反馈2008年7月15日：感谢您选择下榻我们的宾馆及为我们提出的宝贵的意见,对于您提出的意见我们已经做了整改.希望您下次到昆明还能选择我们宾馆,我们将竭诚为您服务!","The room is new this year, which is very good.The service is good, there is a pick -up service, the pick -up staff is very enthusiastic, and it feels good to the guests.When checking out, it is proposed to change the water order.

I hope that the waiter will consider before saying ""NO"" to try to solve the problem for the guests.The ticket booking service does not know if it is returned to the hotel management, and it feels that there is a certain gap between the service and the overall level of the hotel.Hotel feedback on July 15, 2008: Thank you for choosing to stay in our hotel and the valuable opinions that we put forward for us.

1,暑假里带家人来太原度假，住了四天三晋，三天国贸，虽说硬件设施上前者远不如后者，但在服务上，后者远不如前者。有一晚太太夜里胃病犯了，不仅服务员送来一个传统的热水袋（太太揣了一晚说很温暖）、值班员带了几种胃药过来，更惊讶的是，第二天一早出门时又一个服务员也在问候太太胃好些没有，我们很感动。这里的服务意识好像是培训得很到位，即使大堂里负责打扫的清洁工在遇到客人时细节上也是处理得很礼貌，我们以此为例给孩子上了生动一课。我想三晋大概是以它的服务水准被评到四星级的吧宾馆反馈2008年8月13日：尊敬的我店贵宾：非常感谢您对我店做出的评价，使我们倍感荣幸。我们会再接再励，一如既往的为您提供我们的服务。欢迎您再次光临我酒店，祝您工作顺利，身体健康，合家幸福！（我店从今日起在携程网上有宾客意见反馈权限，故立即给您回复，再次感谢您的支持！）,"During the summer vacation, he took his family to Taiyuan for vacation. He lived for four days and three days of Jin. Although the former was not as good as the latter in the hardware facilities, the latter was far less than the former in terms of service.One night, my wife had a stomach disease at night, not only the waiter sent a traditional hot water bottle (the wife said it was very warm for one night), and the duty staff brought a few gastric medicines. It was even more surprised that the next morning when I went out the next morningThe waiter is also greeted the wife's stomach or not, we are very moved.The service consciousness here seems to be in place.

1,住过不少酒店，但是从来没有上来评价过，这次入住海景实在太有感触，必须来说一说了。前面所有客人评价的那些优质服务都不再赘述，因为这些都是符合“五星的标准”而已，但是海景的服务确实是做到了从客人的需要出发，想其所想。说说实例吧，这次在青岛很倒霉的患上了急性胃肠炎，大清早要去医院吊水，酒店派了专人陪同。小姑娘提了一个很重的袋子，开始我们都不知道是什么，后来到医院才知道装的是热水瓶、被子、毛巾和水果。跑前跑后帮我们安排好吊水以后，听医生说可以吃点水果，但是发现带的香蕉和橙子都不行，马上跑到外面买了一袋苹果，用开水烫了给我吃。因为听说她其实已经下班了我们就极力让她回去休息了，但是她坚持不肯，整个2个多小时的过程，始终微笑的坐在我对面看我有什么需要，看到我手臂冷就去烫了毛巾给我敷，倒水、拿东西没停过。后来我们终于知道她为什么不肯离开，是因为要等快点完了叫酒店派车过来接。回到酒店没超过5分钟，粥就送到房间了――这些都是我们没有要求的服务。离店等待班车的时候，我发烧缩在沙发上，马上有人送来毛毯，问明情况后，过一会就送来了热姜汤，然后我们发现，头顶的空凋悄悄被关掉了......讲了太多细节有些罗嗦，不过真是被感动了。有朋友说，也许是因为奥运树立形象吧，但我感觉不是，很多东西可以规定可以培训的，但服务的意识决不是一朝一夕就能有的。再去青岛，海景花园是我唯一的选择！补充：我们要给那个服务员200块钱，因为给小费很正常更不要说人家跑前跑后那么辛苦，但是她坚决不要！,"I have lived in a lot of hotels, but I have never come up to evaluate it. This time, staying in the sea view is too touching, and it must be said.All the high -quality services evaluated by the previous guests are no longer described, because these are only in line with the ""five -star standards"", but the service of sea views is indeed based on the needs of the guests, thinking about what they think.Let's talk about examples. This time, I suffered from acute gastroenteritis in Qingdao very unlucky. I went to the hospital to hang water early in the morning. The hotel sent a special person to accompany it.The little girl raised a very heavy bag. At first we didn't know what it was. Later, I went to the hospital to know that the hot water bottle, quilt, towels and fruits were installed.After running before running, I helped us arrange the water. I heard the doctor said that I could eat some fruits, but I found that the bananas and oranges I brought were not working. I immediately ran outside to buy a bag of apples and hot with boiling water.Because I heard that she was already out of work, we tried to let her go back to rest, but she persisted, and the entire process of more than two hours, always sitting opposite me to see what I need.Go to scald the towels for me, pour water and take things without stopping.Later, we finally knew why she refused to leave because I had to wait for the hotel to send a car to pick it up.It didn't take more than 5 minutes to return to the hotel, and the porridge was delivered to the room -these are all services we do not require.When I was waiting for the shuttle bus, I had a fever on the sofa, and someone sent a blanket immediately. After asking the situation, I sent the hot ginger soup after a while, and then we found that the empty withered on the top of the head was quietly turned off...... I have said too many details, but I was really moved.Some friends said that it may be because the Olympic Games establishes an image, but I don't feel it. Many things can be trained, but the awareness of the service is by no means that it can be available overnight.Going to Qingdao again, Sea View Garden is my only choice!Supplement: We have to give that waiter 200 yuan, because the tip is normal, and don't say that they are so hard before they run, but she is determined!"
0,我3.6预定好的180的标间，当我到的时候竟然说有会议房间满了，我订的房间没有了，太不讲信誉了。唉！下次再也不会住了。,"The 180 standard room I booked in 3.6, when I arrived, I said that there was a meeting room full, and the room I booked was gone. It was too credible.well!I will never live again next time."
1,近日亲临，确实不错，较泉州的其他高星级酒店舒适,"Recently, it is really good, more comfortable than other high -star hotels in Quanzhou"
1,离火车站、地铁站很近，去火车站北出口有近道，熟悉了还是很方便。房间装修很不错，房间有点小，出差住也够用了，服务非常好，早餐有点简单。就是离学校比较近，周一至周五早上七点多，孩子们出操，鼓乐齐鸣有点吵，不睡懒觉的倒也没关系。,"It is very close to the railway station and subway station. There is a close way to the north exit of the train station. It is still very convenient to be familiar.The room decoration is very good, the room is a bit small, it is enough to live on a business trip, the service is very good, and the breakfast is a bit simple.It is closer to the school. At more than 7 o'clock in the morning from Monday to Friday, the children were fucking."
0,唉，怎么说呢，这是我住过的最差的的四星的酒店，还是贵宾楼，晕！硬件设施估计只有二星的标准。性价比太低！,"Alas, how do you say, this is the worst four -star hotel I have lived, or VIP building, dizzy!Hardware facilities are estimated to have only two stars.The price / performance ratio is too low!"

1,很有纳西风格的酒店，感觉很好，第二次住这间酒店了，虽然离北门比较远，要走路过去，但是南门相对住宿来说会比较安静，北门的夜市开到太晚，我想很难入睡，贵宾房间也很大，很安静．前面也有吃东西的，烧烤啊，酒吧什么的，都还ok，下次如果在去还会选择这里．,"Very Naxi -style hotel, it feels good.

1,酒店环境和服务都是五星级的，去周围几个五星级酒店逛了一圈作对比，还是觉得万豪好，下次还会选万豪。,The hotel's environment and services are five -star. I went to several five -star hotels around and went around for a comparison. I still feel that Wanhao is good. I will choose Marriott next time.
1,看了网上的评价因此预期并不高订的是三人间进到房间里感到还可以尽管住的是传说中条件不好的前楼人均60元的价格还是很有吸引力的但房间的确也存在一定问题比如电视机的频道较少而且不清楚床单不是很干净有破洞还有没有洗干净的血渍淋浴的喷头水量超小但工作人员的服务态度比较好能热心回到我们的一些问题酒店的位置也非常好距离滨江道和劝业场比较近整体上性价比还不错,"After watching the online evaluation, it is not expected that the three -person room can enter the room and feel that you can still live at the price of 60 yuan per capita per capita in the legend.There are certain problems, such as there are fewer channels for TVs, and it is not clear that the sheets are not very clean. There are no holes and whether the water -stained shower with a clean shower is super small, but the staff's service attitude is better to return to some of our questions.The location is also very good from Binjiang Road and the persuasion field. The overall cost -effectiveness is not bad."
1,2007年7月17日，我们一行共10人入住了美丽的亚龙湾环球城大酒店，来三亚之前联系了酒店的“非洲王子”，并要求他为我们安排了游泳比赛、蓝球比赛、卡拉OK比赛和享用了“非洲热辣风情自助烤全牛+海鲜”。在他精心的安排下，一切行程非常完美，就是时间太仓促了点。谢谢酒店员工们的热情服务！这次我的同事们也都很满意，大部分人都没有享受过这样的酒店，下次有机会还是要住这家酒店的。,"On July 17, 2007, a total of 10 people in our party stayed in the beautiful Asian Long Bay Global City Hotel. Before coming to Sanya, they contacted the hotel's ""Prince of Africa"" and asked him to arrange for us to swim the swimming competition, blue ball game, karaokeThe competition and enjoying ""African hot style buffet baked whole beef+seafood"".Under his careful arrangement, all the strokes are perfect, that is, the time is too hasty.Thank you hotel employees for your enthusiastic service!My colleagues are also very satisfied this time. Most people have never enjoyed such a hotel. Next time, I still have to stay in this hotel."
1,"入住8号楼81118房,服务人员态度很热情周到,房间整洁,早餐比较丰富.卫生间略显陈旧.","Check in Room 8118, Building 8, the service staff attitude is very enthusiastic and thoughtful, the room is neat, and the breakfast is richer. The bathroom is slightly old."
1,"服务很好,房间质量太差,差点被蚊子给吃了..唉..不过服务员的服务真的很好,能和五星级的相比..","The service is very good, the quality of the room is too poor, and I was almost eaten by mosquitoes .. Well .. But the waiter's service is really good. It can be compared with five -star .."
0,很好的地理位置，一蹋糊涂的服务，萧条的酒店。,"Very good geographical location, confused service, depressed hotel."
0,前台人员太少，我住进酒店当天前台只有一名服务人员，而且是实习生。而后面却排着10名顾客在等。,"There are too few at the front desk. On the day of the hotel, I only had one service staff, and I was an intern.There were 10 customers waiting behind."
1,酒店设备不错，也干净，但离地铁站还是有一段距离，要穿过好几个小商场，没什么路标指示，还是要问一下人。但这样的价钱，性价比算不错了。而且用港币付款，兑成人民币很划算。,"The hotel equipment is good and clean, but there is still a distance from the subway station. You have to pass through several small shopping malls. There are no road signs instructions. You still have to ask people.But the price is good for such a price.And it is cost -effective to pay the RMB with Hong Kong dollars."
1,住了一晚，感觉还不错。服务员的态度很热情，房间虽然不大，但是很整洁卫生。最好的一点是位置不错，步行不到5分钟就是机场大巴的上清寺车站，到重庆火车站步行也只需要10分钟左右。特别推荐酒店附近一家齐齐火锅，非常价廉物美。,"After staying for a night, it feels pretty good.The waiter's attitude is very enthusiastic. Although the room is not large, it is neat and hygienic.The best point is that the location is good. It is less than 5 minutes walking in Shangqing Temple Station of the airport bus. It only takes about 10 minutes to walk at Chongqing Railway Station.It is recommended to have a hot pot near the hotel, which is very cost -effective."
1,总台的服务生挺热情的，感觉很亲切。这家酒店最大的特点是房间宽敞，床很软，睡得舒服，免费宽带上网对我很实用。离机场的距离不远，到我办事的公司也近，下次还会选择入住。,"The waiter of the main station is very enthusiastic and feels kind.The biggest feature of this hotel is that the room is spacious, the bed is very soft, the bed is comfortable, and the free broadband Internet access is very practical to me.The distance from the airport is not far from the company, and the company in my business is also close. I will choose to stay next time."
1,很好的酒店，很喜欢，房间很干净很漂亮，从房间的窗口看出去，超美的，在市中心区域，出行也非常的方便，有机会一定会再住的。,"Very good hotel, I like it very well. The room is very clean and beautiful. From the window of the room, it is super beautiful. In the city center area, travel is also very convenient, and there will be a chance to live again."
0,柜台里经常坐着4个人，不管是入住还是退房，会几个人倒手办手续。十分不解！效率低不说，他们居然会把你的信用卡扔在一边，去干别的事情。无论你表现出愤怒、急切或是无奈，服务生全然无动于衷。前边有点评说，卫生间小。其实非但小，且设计不合理，洗澡水会流到整个卫生间。图片与房间实际情况严重不符。公寓居然只有一个开水壶。很不方便。,"There are often 4 people sitting in the counter. Whether they are in or out of the house, a few people will handle the procedures.Very puzzled!If the efficiency is low, they will actually throw your credit card aside and do other things.Whether you show anger, anxiety or helplessness, the waiter is completely indifferent.There is a little comment before, the bathroom is small.In fact, not only small and unreasonable design, bath water will flow to the entire bathroom.The picture is seriously inconsistent with the actual situation of the room.The apartment actually has only one opening kettle.Very inconvenient."
1,对从郑州市以外的其他城市前往机场搭早班机的客人是个不错的选择，专车随叫随发，非常方便，房间干净。特别是没有“按摩”的骚扰电话，有助客人安静休息。补充点评2007年12月22日：先期入住是有骚扰电话，并在携程网上点评，不知是不是因此而有所改善。,"It is a good choice for guests from other cities outside Zhengzhou to the airport to take early plane. The special car is called to follow the hair. It is very convenient and the room is clean.In particular, there is no ""massage"" harassment call, which helps guests to rest quietly.Supplementary comment on December 22, 2007: There is a harassment phone call in the preliminary check -in, and commented on Ctrip.com. I wonder if it has improved because of this."
1,第N次入住了，就是方便去客户那里哈哈。还有啥说的,"The N time stayed, it was convenient to go to the customer haha.What's more"
1,住过几次，整体来说条件不错，性价比蛮高的一家哦！可能是入住率太高吧，常常是等打扫的时间比较长,"I have lived a few times, and the overall conditions are good, and the cost -effective one is quite high!It may be that the occupancy rate is too high, it is often waiting for the cleaning time for a long time"
1,01年间的酒店现在设施还很新啊。位置不错，离广场周边购物都近。携程提供的离机场距离不对，应该至少20公里以上。,"The hotel in 2001 is still new.The location is good, and it is close to shopping around the square.The distance from the airport provided by Ctrip should be at least 20 kilometers."
1,房间大小合适，装修比较旧。周边环境较好，离白鹭洲很近，步行只要几分钟，晚上散步不错。泳池是室外的，更衣室设施一般。房间的烟味较大。,"The room is suitable and the decoration is relatively old.The surrounding environment is better, very close to Bailuzhou. It takes only a few minutes to walk and walk well at night.The pool is outdoors, and the locker room facilities are average.The smell of smoke in the room is greater."
1,差就一个字！房间隔音差，马路上的声音声声入耳！所谓的宽带还没有拨号上网快，打开网页要等半天，收邮件整整收了5个小时才收下来！跟前台反映问题说没有办法解决！,"Just one word!The sound insulation of the room is poor, and the sound on the road is in the ears!The so -called broadband has not dialed the Internet fast. It takes a long time to open the webpage and collect the mail for 5 hours before receiving it!There is no way to solve the problem in the front desk!"
1,酒店依山而建，环境很好，房间的设施也不错，阳台可以看见内庭园也可以看见山景。机场可以接机很方便客人，否则当地的出租车很贵，没150元不肯走的。,"The hotel is built on the mountain, the environment is very good, and the room facilities are also good. The balcony can be seen in the inner garden.The airport can pick up the airport very convenient for guests, otherwise the local taxi is expensive, and it is not willing to leave without 150 yuan."
1,非常一般，没啥竞争力~弄了个有电脑的商务大床房，呵呵，白白多交209元，和没打折一样~还是比较安静的~其他就很一般了，电视机狂小，估计21寸的，我都看不清电视里放啥~可怜啊~宾馆反馈2008年7月9日：目前我们已经向公司申请更换电视机。为了方便客人，我们增加了部分电脑房间，收费为：20元。,"Very general, there is no competitiveness ~ I got a big business bed room with a computer, huh, fixed 209 yuan in vain, as if it was not discounted ~ It is still relatively quiet ~ others are very average, the TV machine is small, it is estimated that 21 is 21, it is estimated that 21Inch, I can't see what it is on TV ~ Poor ~ Hotel feedback on July 9, 2008: At present, we have applied to the company to change the TV.In order to facilitate guests, we added some computer rooms, and the charges were: 20 yuan."
1,真如其他会员所说，隔音效果真的是一塌糊涂，隔着3件房间，都可以听到他们的电话铃音。并且强烈提议，酒店的床单，被套等一类，换成白色的。感觉上会比较干净！另外总结一句，携程的介绍还是比较符合实际的。另外在临安市是第一高楼了。大概在20层！补充点评2007年7月30日：希望可以在房间内增设冰箱。,"As other members say, the sound insulation effect is really a mess. By three rooms, they can hear their phone ringing.And strongly proposed that the hotel's sheets, quilts, etc. are replaced with white.It feels clean!In addition, the introduction of Ctrip is more actual.In addition, it is the tallest building in Lin'an.About 20 floors!Supplementary review July 30, 2007: I hope that I can add a refrigerator in the room."
1,酒店的服务非常好，工作人员很热情很有效率。大厅超级大，房间装修有一点点旧，不过不影响本人对这家酒店的好感。酒店离机场10分钟车程，非常方便。门口是在建的高架，周围环境目前一般。,"The hotel's service is very good, and the staff is very enthusiastic and efficient.The lobby is super large, and the room decoration is a little old, but it does not affect my favor for this hotel.The hotel is 10 minutes away from the airport, which is very convenient.The door is an elevated elevated, and the surrounding environment is currently average."
0,宜宾还有很多好的酒店，比如说叙府宾馆就不错，不知道为什么携程没有签这个酒店。,"Yibin also has a lot of good hotels, such as the Xufu Hotel is good. I don't know why Ctrip did not sign this hotel."
1,不错的酒店，好像是公寓改装的，很新的设施，就是前台非常小。服务小姐很亲切，笑容可亲。,"A good hotel seems to be modified by the apartment. It is very new, that is, the front desk is very small.The service lady is very kind and smiles."
1,前两次都是入住的精致套房，这次选的是丽家套房B，两种房间价格差不多但差距也太大了，以后要是再去南京一定要选丽家套房B，房间设施方面都比精致套房好几倍。,The first two times were exquisite suite for staying. This time I chose Lijia suite B. The price of two rooms is almost the same but the gap is too large. If you go to Nanjing in the futureThe exquisite suite is several times.
1,周遍环境很好，清晨起床开窗空气很清新。酒店初看感觉象度假村的感觉，宾馆的花园里还养了两只孔雀：）前台服务人员态度非常好，也很热情。为我保留房间，还为我照看行李。房间很普通，感觉就是以前老宾馆的样子，卫生间不干净，浴缸挺脏，害的我没敢洗澡。送的早餐极其简单，炒面，粥，没了！似乎住的人不多，我春节去的，一天住下来几乎没看到人，到了晚上酒店灯光混暗，外面狗叫的很响，里面却一点人的声音听不到。我和LP开玩笑，明天早上我们起来酒店就消失了，我们睡在了雪地里：）,"The environment is very good, and the air from getting up in the morning is very fresh.At first glance, the hotel felt like a resort. There were two peacocks in the garden of the hotel :) The front desk service staff attitude and enthusiastic.Keep the room for me and take care of my luggage for me.The room is very ordinary. It feels like the old hotel. The bathroom is not clean, the bathtub is dirty, and I do n’t dare to take a bath.The breakfast delivered is extremely simple, fried noodles, porridge, no more!There are not many people who live. I went to the Spring Festival. I almost didn't see anyone in a day. In the evening, the hotel lights were darkened.I joked with LP, and the hotel will disappear tomorrow morning. We slept in the snow :)"
1,"实在太远了，到香港就是满足购物需要，留在酒店出门不方便。酒店在新界屯门边上，到屯门中心打车也要$25.周边没商场餐厅.下次不再选择了.可取之处:设施还可以,如果度蜜月一两天还行.","It's too far away. It is inconvenient to stay in the hotel to meet the needs of shopping.The hotel is on the side of Tuen Mun in New Territories, and it takes $ 25 to take a taxi at the center of Tuen Mun. There is no shopping malls around the surrounding area. I will not choose the next time. It is advisable: the facility is OK, if the honeymoon is okay for a day or two."
1,4年前住过。酒店设施这个价格还算值，尤其是黄金周期间。临海位置很好。高层，大部分房间都可以看到海。前台接待的小姐态度很生硬，登记的姓名没一个字是对的。算啦，不影响住也就不计较了。,"I lived 4 years ago.The price of hotel facilities is still valuable, especially during the Golden Week.The location of the sea is very good.High -rise, most of the rooms can be seen.The lady received at the front desk is very stiff, and the registered name is not the same.Forget it, it does not matter if it does not affect it."
1,春节特价入住套房，含早/晚餐，服务非常到位，只是由于酒店有些老，但是设施还算不错！只不过这种春节价位希望酒店能够实现春节特价周末常态化，这样会吸引大部分旅客！,"Special offer in the Spring Festival, including early/dinner, the service is very in place, but because the hotel is old, but the facilities are pretty good!It's just that this Spring Festival price hopes that hotels can achieve the normalization of the Spring Festival special weekend, which will attract most passengers!"
0,"酒店太旧了,中午进房的时候吓了一跳,晚上进屋就好多了.因为灯光昏暗的关系.第一次住经济型酒店,搞得感觉很不好.不过床还是蛮干净的,淋浴的水也很大,这个价钱在北京也只能住这酒店了!","The hotel is too old. When I entered the room at noon, I was shocked, and I was much better at night. Because of the dim relationship of the light. The first time I lived in a economy hotel, I felt very bad.The water of the shower is also very large, and the price can only stay in this hotel in Beijing!"
0,前几天在这家酒店住宿，没想到上当了，服务员居然说毛巾让客人用脏了，让客人掏清洗费，他们的一个经理模样的人也这样说，最后让客人把毛巾买下来，住过的宾馆多了，真没见过这么还有服务的，这不是宰客人吗。希望打算去住的客人要多注意，千万要用自己的毛巾，否则用脏了就要掏清洗费或是买下毛巾。,"I stayed at this hotel a few days ago. I didn't expect it to be a fooled. The waiter actually said that the towels made the guests dirty and asked the guests to pay the cleaning fee.There are too many hotels, I have never seen such a service, isn't this slaughter.I hope that the guests who plan to live should pay more attention, and they must use their own towels, otherwise they must pay the washing fee or buy a towel."
0,面前就是高架，实在是太吵了，一晚上没睡！宾馆反馈2008年7月7日：您好！首先很报歉您一晚上未休息好，北虹路店是邻近中环的，面前是中环高架，白天的时候车会多一点，但是20点以后中环的车就会很少的，我们房间的隔间效果还是可以的，只要把窗户关上，基本上就没有很大的声音的，并且住我们北虹店的客人大多数都是商务客人，房型也是各异的，大多数客人喜欢正面朝中环的房间，因为这种房型采光较好，空气的流通性也很不错！但我们也有很安静面朝小区的房间，针对各种需求的客人，您下次入住时我们会安排您入住朝小区的房间，希望您再给我们这样的机会！让您感受如家“家”的气息！！,"There is an elevator in front of me, it's too noisy, I didn't sleep all night!Hotel feedback on July 7, 2008: Hello!First of all, I apologize for you not to rest all night. The Beihong Road Store is adjacent to Central. It is an elevated in front of the Central. In the daytime, there will be more cars. However, there will be few cars in Central after 20 o'clock.The effect is still possible. As long as the window is closed, there is basically no sound, and most of the guests living in our Beihong Store are business guests, and the room types are different. Most guests like the front and central ring in the front of the middle.The room, because this room type is well light, and the flow of air is also very good!But we also have a quiet room to facing the community. For guests with various needs, we will arrange for you to stay in the room in the Chao District next time when you stay in. I hope you will give us such opportunities!Let you feel the breath of ""home""!Intersection"
0,服务很一般房间还可以条件比较一般价格没竞争力,"The service is very general room, and the conditions can also be more competitive. Generally, the price is not competitive."
1,餐厅装修停业却无通知。正餐时间只有一种自助，别无选择。如此寒冷季节还要外出寻找饭馆。,"The restaurant decoration was stopped without notice.There is only one kind of self -service time, no choice.In this cold season, go out to find restaurants."
1,地点不错，从客运站坐TAXI到饭店大约7.5块，柜台小姐先生服务很好！房间更是优，乾净整洁舒服，一晚355的价格，算很划算。不过早餐有点贵！下次去泉州还会去住。,"The location is good, take TAXI from the passenger station about 7.5 yuan to the hotel.The room is even more excellent, clean, tidy and comfortable. The price of 355 a night is very cost -effective.But breakfast is a bit expensive!Next time I go to Quanzhou, I will live."
1,先说个差的吧：热水黄得要命，每天打电话问总台，得到的回复都是在洗锅炉。携程最好能做到贴图的，我把浴缸要命的水的照片发上来。好的方面是地理位置比较好。最近太原在大修路，交通有时候很堵，没办法。旁边一家酒店更差（当然不是携程指定的），不敢盖被子，凌晨冻醒了，居然找不到被子。因为我飞机晚上9点半到，酒店人员说是打电话给我，因为手机没开，结果房间没给我预定。在旁边的一家住了一宿。希望立马改进。补充点评2007年6月30日：洗了一个星期左右，实在看不下去了，找个当班的上来，臭骂了他一顿，他转身不到两分钟，水就变清了。这不是欺负人么。,"Let's talk about the difference first: hot water is dead, calling the head office every day, and the reply you get is to wash the boiler.Ctrip is best to be a sticker, and I post the photos of the water in the bathtub.A good aspect is that the geographical location is better.Recently, Taiyuan has been repairing the road. The traffic is sometimes blocked and there is no way.A hotel next to him was even worse (of course, not specified by Ctrip), and he dared not cover the quilt. He woke up in the early morning and couldn't find the quilt.Because my plane arrived at 9:30 in the evening, the hotel staff said it was called me, because the phone was not turned on, but the room did not book me.The one next to him lived.Hope immediately to improve.Supplementary comment on June 30, 2007: After washing for about a week, I couldn't stand it anymore. I found a class and scolded him for a meal. He turned around for less than two minutes, and the water became clear.Isn't this bullying?"
1,环境优雅安静，湖景房确实美景如画，早晚在挂满了咏风叹景对联的长廊散步闲坐，身心极度放松。房价虽高，环境确非镇中酒店能比。在此小住，有傍湖泳池任游，有满目湖景，连游湖也省了。早餐也够水准。,"The environment is elegant and quiet, and the lake view room is indeed picturesque. Sooner or later, the corridor of the gallery of Yongfeng sigh is to sit and sit away and relax.Although the house prices are high, the environment is indeed comparable to the hotel in the town.Live here, there are swimming pools in the lake, and there are lakes, and even the lake is saved.Breakfast is also standard."
1,感觉比老街口客栈舒适，很中规中矩的3星级，推荐大家住主楼的豪华间，设施比较好，前台和大堂的服务比较热情，通过酒店推荐的出租车司机十分的讲诚信，守时！这才是我最喜欢这家酒店的地方。就是洗澡水有时忽冷忽热，希望改进。,"It feels more comfortable than the old street inns. It is very satisfactory. It is recommended that everyone lives in the luxury room of the main building. The facilities are better. The service of the front desk and the lobby is more enthusiastic. The taxi driver recommended by the hotel is very honest and time -keeping!This is where I like this hotel the most.It is sometimes cold and hot, hoping to improve."
0,"早餐很一般.房间里还算干净,就是噪音太大,价格相对来说还是贵的","The breakfast is very average. The room is quite clean, that is, the noise is too high, and the price is relatively expensive."
1,在上海少见的带游泳池的酒店公寓，周围的环境很不错，超市、饭店、酒吧等很多，不去市中心还是不错的。房间超大，装潢、设施一般。有厨房，但餐具等居然要租赁，似乎不甚合理。游泳池很小，不知何故水呈绿色（可能是瓷砖缘故），不如蓝色的游泳池舒服。早餐一般，不够丰富，早餐厅可以晒到太阳，蛮好。员工服务需要提高，至少应让客人感觉到亲切和微笑。,"In the rare hotel apartment with a swimming pool in Shanghai, the surrounding environment is very good. There are many supermarkets, restaurants, bars, etc. It is still good to not go to the city center.The room is large, decoration and facilities are average.There is a kitchen, but it seems unreasonable to rent it.The swimming pool is very small. I do n’t know why the water is green (maybe because of tiles), which is not as comfortable as the blue swimming pool.Breakfast is generally not rich enough. Breakfast can be exposed to the sun, which is pretty good.Employee services need to be improved, at least to make guests feel kind and smile."
1,2月初住在这，服务很好，嘱咐他们的事情都办的很好。打扫房间比较及时。不知道其他房间怎么样，反正315房间的空调对这门吹，房间还是很冷，幸好有电热毯，空调噪音大，都不敢一直开着。热水早上好像热一点。最喜欢他们有体重秤，呵呵。隔音可以接受，上楼的声音能很清楚的听到。没有大灯，我自己不喜欢房间暗暗的。洗澡时浴室门关不严，不过没有积水现象。价格比较贵，有不少老外住在这里。要是喜欢服务周到这里没问题，要是喜欢家的感觉还是要住私人客栈，很温馨！,"Living here in early February, the service is very good, and the things they are told to do well.Cleaning the room is more timely.I do n’t know how other rooms are. Anyway, the air conditioner in Room 315 is still very cold. Fortunately, there are electric blankets, and the air conditioning is noisy.Hot water seems to be hot in the morning.I like their weight scales the most, haha.The sound insulation is acceptable, and the sound of upstairs can be heard clearly.Without headlights, I don't like the room secretly.The bathroom door is not strictly closed during the bath, but there is no stagnant phenomenon.The price is more expensive, and many foreigners live here.If you like the service, there is no problem here. If you like your home, you still have to live in a private inn, which is very warm!"
1,"总体来说不错了,房间和卫生间都不错.门口太小不好找.餐厅不太好,味道不好.房价偏贵了.","Overall it is good, the rooms and bathrooms are good. The door is too small to find. The restaurant is not very good and the taste is not good. House prices are expensive."
1,房间不错，朋友很满意，价格很实惠，服务态度很好,"The room is good, friends are very satisfied, the price is affordable, the service attitude is very good"
1,刚从武汉回到香港，急不及待就要评价。饭店的硬件设施没有愧对她的四星评级，只有少许瑕疵。因为房间供应少，也因有婚宴包房安客造成紧张而未能安排我入住要求的无烟房，所以，我透过中央空调就嗅到隔壁传来的少许二手烟臭，房间墙壁和床头板也有少许地方见到抹不走的老秽渍，沐浴间不算大，加上房间的隔声也不完善，可以馍糊地听到邻房的说话声音，大堂也缺少让客人免费坐下来的沙发，但是，这些都没有影响她的四星标准，更绝对没有被妓女或杂人骚扰，若能将房价下调少许就会更理想（四星的标准房折后也要五百元人民币，是稍贵）。在这里，我要表扬这家饭店的服务员，很亲切友善很有礼貌，包括大堂的Angel小姐，楼层的清洁阿姨。还有一事要说的，是我入住的期间曾不小心地在饭店大堂遗下一瓶名贵红酒，幸好酒店的门童是兄弟曾听我和朋友在大堂见面时谈及喝酒，而且见过我提着一个塑料袋子在等朋友，所以他马上就能认得那樽酒是我留下的，第二天就马上归还，这是绝对值得称赞的行为（只是忘了问他名字，无法向经理表扬他的表现）。,"As soon as I returned from Wuhan to Hong Kong, I was anxious to evaluate.The hardware facilities of the restaurant do not have a ratio of her four -star rating, only a little flaw.Because the room supply is small, and because there is a wedding banquet room, the housekeeper is tension and failed to arrange the smoke -free house required by me.There are also a few places to see the old filthy stains. The bathroom is not large, and the sound insulation in the room is not perfect. You can hear the voice of the neighbor's room.The sofa that came down, but these did not affect her four -star standard, and it was absolutely not harassed by prostitutes or miscellaneous people.It is slightly more expensive).Here, I want to praise the waiter of this hotel, very kind and friendly, including Miss Angel in the lobby, cleaning aunt on the floor.Another thing to say is that during the period of my staying, I accidentally left a bottle of precious red wine in the hotel lobby. Fortunately, the hotel of the hotel was a brother who had talked about drinking with my friends when I met in the lobby, and saw me.With a plastic bag waiting for friends, he can immediately recognize that the bottle of wine was left by me, and returned the next day.His performance)."
0,典型的国营酒店，管理层缺乏责任心，管理混乱。房间里的大灯镜灯台灯都是坏的，只有一盏床头灯可用，不知道酒店是怎么维护的。最可气的是结帐时竟然要求客人赔偿房间里已损坏很久的鞋盒，简直是讹诈。,"Typical state -owned hotels lack a sense of responsibility and chaos.The headlights in the room are bad, only one bedside lamp is available. I don't know how the hotel is maintained.The most annoying thing is that at the checkout, the shoe box, which was asked to compensate the room for a long time in the room, was simply blackmail."
0,"一个字:差,2个字:很差.3个字:非常差.实在不能住人.哎!要不是其他饭店太贵的话，我是绝对不会定这间的.CTRIP没有把真实的房间照片反应出来.","One word: bad, 2 words: very bad. 3 words: very bad. It really can't live. Hey! If it wasn't for other restaurants, I would never decide this .CTRIP did not take the real room photoThe response came out."
0,看评价撞去的，但印象很不好，很吵，有被愚弄感觉，最终提前退房。怀疑其他溢美评价的真实性。五星房价，四星外观实际三星环境硬件，按约1500的房价评价，严重超卖，至多值个600元，应该比东湖1号楼不如。入住时前台主动告诉我说专门给一个非常好和安静的房间，进房（701)发现面对工地，问能否换房，告知可以换（还有其他空房），但景观未必比这个面对工地的好。只好如此。一晚上发现周围楼道特别吵，隔壁不断的人声和关闭大门的磕碰声。无法入睡，早上起来发现隔壁是餐厅和服务员的房间。酒店前台显然知道次房很吵，有缺陷，既然知道吵，何必特意声称给我一个特别好的房间？感觉有意愚弄人。懒得生气跟他们，提前一天退房。补充点评2007年12月25日：酒店楼下停车场每天还收80元停车费。,"See the evaluation and hit it, but the impression was very bad, very noisy, was fooled, and eventually checked out in advance.Suspect the authenticity of other overflowing evaluations.Five -star house prices, the four -star appearance, the actual Samsung environmental hardware, is evaluated by about 1500 housing prices, which is seriously sold, and the value is 600 yuan, which should be less than the East Lake Building 1.During the check -in, the front desk took the initiative to tell me that it was specially given a very good and quiet room. When I entered the house (701), I found that in the face of the construction site, I asked if I could change the house, and inform me that I could change (and other empty houses), but the landscape may not be better than the face of this face.The construction site is good.Have to do so.One night I found that the surrounding corridor was particularly noisy, and the sound of human voice next door and the touch of closing the door.I couldn't fall asleep. I got up in the morning and found that the next door was the restaurant and waiter's room.The hotel's front desk clearly knows that the second room is noisy and flawed. Since you know noisy, why do you specifically claim to give me a particularly good room?Feeling intention to fool people.Lazyly angry with them, check out one day in advance.Supplementary comment on December 25, 2007: The parking lot downstairs also collects 80 yuan per day of parking."
1,我是看了网友的评价最后选择庐山宾馆的，总体感觉非常满意，下次去还住那。庐山真的很美，大家有机会去了就知道。最好的景点我觉得是三叠泉，沿着山路走下去一路上景色真是美不胜收，其次是仙人洞，美庐倒不觉得好。不和谐因素是，庐山有些饭店宰客的，这点要格外当心，山洞外的一排饭店多是宰客的，要当心哦。另外，出租车司机推荐的饭店，宾馆要当心拉，出租车司机有回扣的。最后我给大家推荐一家饭店，我在庐山呆的两天全是在她家吃的，价格实惠，味道很好。庐山顺裕饭店，庐山牯岭正街46#，tel:13870299673，我这可不是广告哈，我觉得诚信经营的商家就是要鼓励。,"I looked at the evaluation of netizens and chose Lushan Hotel. Overall feel very satisfied, I will stay there next time.Lushan is really beautiful, and everyone knows if you have a chance.I think the best attractions are three stacked springs. Going along the mountain road, the scenery is really beautiful all the way, followed by the cave of the fairy. Meilu doesn't feel good.The disagreement is that some restaurants in Lushan are particularly careful. A row of restaurants outside the cave are mostly slaughtered. Be careful.In addition, the hotel recommended by the taxi driver should be paid to the hotel, and the taxi driver has a rebate.In the end, I recommend a restaurant. I was eating at her house in Lushan for two days. The price was affordable and the taste was good.Lushan Shunyu Hotel, Lushan Lingling Zhengjie 46#, Tel: 13870299673, I am not an advertisement. I think the merchant operating in integrity is to encourage."
1,上个周末又去了河源。这回提前预订了万豪国际酒店2个晚上，酒店真的没有令我们夫妇失望，我们为自己的选择洋洋得意。当时由于不能在约定的时间傍晚6点钟之前到达酒店，和酒店联系时，酒店接待处非常有礼和善解人意，让我们两公婆非常放心地优哉游哉地在半夜2点到了酒店，酒店大堂不霸气但很大气，前台设计不是像其他酒店那样让客人站着填单，而是让我舒舒服服地坐着，非常愉快地办好了入住手续。不得不提一句，真的好漂亮的前台美眉哦，俏丽、恬静、端庄，怪不得人家都说客家妹美上人心窝.....酒店有主楼房间和别墅房间，标准客房都在别墅区，楼梯上下，一梯两个房间，房间干净、整齐，互联网免费，网速快，洗手间有时尚杂志，还有英文版的。洗澡间水压好，洗澡非常舒服，老公在里面洗澡伴着水声哼了一小时的歌都不肯出来，还说是因为万绿湖的原因，水的滋味很好，哈哈，真是有点快乐得爱屋及乌的可能了！！住了两个晚上，由于整个周末都下雨，几顿饭都在酒店里叹美食，一楼的食街出品非常精致，味道正，无论是大餐牌上正餐大菜，还是特色风味小菜，大厨即点即煮，卖相造型已经让人满心欢喜了，我们最后还餐后有甜品，加起来才70多元，按照性价比，超值！（唯一可惜的是，因为之前的一个周末已经在这里吃过晚餐，知道这有好东西，所以当晚半夜2点到达酒店时以为这里还是24小时营业，美滋滋地想来个房间送餐，结果被告知2点收市，自己心理作用就觉得更加饿得不行了，两公婆狂吃了一盒曲奇）。12楼是旋转餐厅，两个午餐都在上面，碰巧设备检修，餐厅不转，不过也没问题，俯视文化广场，风景不错，偶尔还有点和风细雨，雨还没停，就可以看到有人在打篮球和乒乓球了。两个中午都点了沙拉，牛扒，还有一个套餐，不错。下次来，打算去11楼尝尝那里的私房菜。差点忘了说说，一楼食街的洗手间很干净，老公一听，赶紧也去瞧瞧，果然！两人哈哈大笑，因为一般在外面我是不去洗手间的，能让我放心进去解决问题而又满意的洗手间更是少之又少，哈哈！好！可以肯定，这里的员工有非常严格的工作准则，严格的培训之后一定是严格的管理。天下着雨，门童一看见我们回来，马上扛着个七彩大伞就过来，态度非常友好，雨伞实在是大，动作有点憨态可掬，我们都乐不可支，非常开心！房间服务员和我们在楼下迎面相遇，都静静地停下来在一边向我们问好。由于我们房间冷气出现了一点问题，客房部处理的比较专业，联系换房、搬行李，换钥匙，都是显得有条不紊，快捷妥当。这已经让我们非常满意了。外出度假，希望酒店让客人心情愉快是首要的，万豪做到了，我们还会再来入住的！如果真的要说些建议的话，权且当是我挑剔吧。洗手间渗水的情况不容忽视，我们住了很多的酒店，基本上都存在着个问题，而我偏偏又是对洗手间的要求特别高，干净、简约、温馨、宽敞、不积水、不渗水，万豪国际酒店，除了渗水这个国内酒店老大难问题，其他的都达我标准了。哈哈！或许希望酒店能在别墅区里设置有一张大床的房间类型，因为我们是周末自费休闲客人，就不希望付公司商务差旅的价格房费去预定商务房间，虽然不是商旅，但也希望能安寝哦！看到很多别墅前都停泊着名贵靓车，相信也是来休闲度假的情侣，他们也需要大大的安睡空间哦！考虑考虑！,"I went to Heyuan again last weekend.This time I booked two nights of Marriott International Hotel in advance. The hotel really did not disappoint our couple. We are proud of our choices.At that time, because I could not arrive at the hotel before 6 o'clock in the evening at the agreed time. When contacting the hotel, the hotel reception area was very polite and understandable. Let us two in -laws arrive at the hotel at 2 o'clock in the middle of the night at 2 o'clock in the middle of the night.The lobby is not domineering but very atmospheric. The design of the front desk is not to let the guests stand by the guests like other hotels, but let me sit comfortably and handle the movement procedures very happily.I have to mention that the beautiful front desk is beautiful, pretty, quiet, dignified, no wonder people say that Hakka girls are beautiful ..... The hotel has the main building room and villa room. The standard rooms are in the villa area.On the upper and lower stairs, there are two rooms in one staircase. The room is clean and neat. The Internet is free, the Internet speed is fast, there are fashion magazines in the bathroom, and the English version.The bathroom has a good water pressure, and the bathing bath is very comfortable. Her husband refuses to come out in the song with the sound of water and the sound of water. It is also said that it is because of the Wan Lake Lake.You have to love the house and Wu!IntersectionAfter living for two nights, because it rained throughout the weekend, a few meals sighed food in the hotel. The food street on the first floor was very delicate and the taste was positive.The kitchen is cooked immediately, and the appearance of the selling appearance is already full of joy. We finally have desserts after the meal, which adds up to more than 70 yuan. According to cost -effectiveness, excellent value!(The only pity is that because the previous weekend had been eaten here for dinner, knowing that there was a good thing, so when I arrived at the hotel at 2 o'clock in the middle of the night, I thought it was still open for 24 hours.At 2 o'clock to collect the city, his psychological effect felt even more hungry, and the two in -laws ate a box of Qiqi).The 12th floor is a rotating restaurant. Both lunch is on it. It happens that the equipment is maintained. The restaurant is not transferred, but there is no problem. Looking down at the cultural square, the scenery is good, occasionally a little and the wind drizzle.Basketball and table tennis.Both at noon ordered salads, steak, and a package, good.Next time, I plan to go to the 11th floor to taste the private dishes there.I almost forgot to talk about it. The toilet on the first floor of the street was very clean. When my husband heard it, he hurried to see it, and sure enough!The two laughed, because I usually do n’t go to the bathroom outside, so I can rest assured to go in to solve the problem and satisfy the toilet, haha!good!It is certain that the employees here have very strict work criteria, and strict training must be strict management after the training.When it was raining in the world, as soon as the door of the door saw us back, he immediately came over with a colorful umbrella. The attitude was very friendly. The umbrella was really big.The room waiter met with us downstairs and stopped quietly to ask us.Because there is a problem with air -conditioning in our rooms, the room department has a relatively professional processing. It seems to be methodical and fast to contact the rooms to change houses, move luggage, and change keys.This has made us very satisfied.Going out on vacation, I hope the hotel will make guests feel happy in the mood. Marriott has done it, and we will stay in again!If you really want to say some suggestions, and I am very picky.The water seepage of the toilet cannot be ignored. We have lived in many hotels and basically have problems. I just have high requirements for the toilet, clean, simple, warm, spacious, not accumulating water, no water seepage, Marriott, MarriottInternational hotels, in addition to the problem of the boss of domestic hotels, the other are all my standards.Ha ha!Maybe I hope the hotel can set up a large bed type in the villa area, because we are a leisure guest at their own expense on the weekend, so we don’t want to pay the price of the company's business travel.Sleep!Seeing a lot of villas mooring a precious car, I believe they are also couples who come to leisure and vacation. They also need a big sleeping space!Consider!"
0,房间比较差，尤其是洗手间，房间隔音和餐饮服务都不好。,"The room is relatively poor, especially the toilet. The room sound insulation and catering services are not good."
1,"这次入住该酒店316房间感觉还不错,床足够大,酒店设施还足够齐全,浴室内的温泉泡池也很吸引人,但是似乎下水口有些问题,总是会水漫金山,刚进房间就发现地毯上有滩水,估计是上一个客人洗澡后留下的,冰箱那个柜子也上了锁没有办法打开,作为5星级涉外宾馆,应该注意避免这样尴尬的事情发生.所幸,我和夫人对其服务都还满意,建议宾馆可以考虑将温泉公园的自助餐列入赠送范围,貌似现在是门票168元带自助餐,这样感觉我们被送的188元的票好像亏了的感觉.不过,这也仅仅只是建议而已.","This time I stayed at the hotel 316 in the hotel, and the bed was large enough. The hotel facilities were complete enough. The hot spring bubble ponds in the bathroom was also very attractive, but it seemed that there were some problems in the water outlet.I found that there was a beach water on the carpet. It is estimated that the last guest was left after taking a bath. The cabinet of the refrigerator was also locked and there was no way to open it. As a 5 -star foreign hotel, you should pay attention to avoid such embarrassing things.It is also satisfactory to its services. It is recommended that hotels can consider incorporated the buffet of hot spring parks in the gift range. It seems that it is now 168 yuan to bring a buffet for tickets.It's just a suggestion."
1,花园式的酒店，在城中，有点旧，但靠花园的房间不错！,"Garden -style hotels are a bit old in the city, but the room in the garden is good!"
0,这个酒店整体来讲还是经济实惠，我三月份来这住，服务员服务还不错，今天就不好，来前台登记说酒店系统升级没有之前的资料了，要重新登记，空调翁翁响，修了一次又一次，我去找几次，前台小姐说：不是修好了吗？态度不好。我也算老顾客了，太差了。房间装修的白灰袋还再房角堆放，明天就换，下次我不会再住了。酒店经理要严整管理才是啊。早点还不错。,"This hotel is still economic affordable as a whole. I come here in March. The waiter's service is not bad. It is not good today. It is not good to come to the front desk.Once again, I went to find it a few times. The lady of the front desk said: Isn't it repaired?The attitude is not good.I am also an old customer, which is too bad.The white -gray bag decorated in the room will be stacked again, and will be changed tomorrow. I won't live again next time.The hotel manager must strictly rectify management.It's not bad early."
1,房价偏贵，设施旧，服务还可以，交通比较方便，携程比自己前台登记也没有优势,"House prices are expensive, facilities are old, service is okay, and transportation is more convenient. Ctrip has no advantage over its front desk registration."
1,酒店的地点很好，到食品街，鼓楼，文化街很方便。,"The location of the hotel is very good. It is very convenient to go to Food Street, Drum Tower, and Cultural Street."
1,"房间较小,但挺干,另外空调噪声较大,晚上睡觉还是有点吵.早餐是自助餐,挺丰富!总体感觉不错!","The room is small, but it is very dry. In addition, the noise of the air conditioner is relatively noisy. Sleeping at night is still a bit noisy. Breakfast is a buffet, which is very rich! Overall feels good!"
1,房间里有冰箱，十分方便。但是离开房间后必须将卡插上，否则没电。正在部分改造，楼道有油漆味。房间比较陈旧里味道比较大，淋浴喷头是坏的。自助早餐，品种比较多。环境比较安静，中央空调运转正常。服务员态度很好。,"There is a refrigerator in the room, which is very convenient.But after leaving the room, the card must be inserted, otherwise there is no power.It is partially transformed, and the corridor has a paint.The room is more old and the taste is large, and the shower head is bad.Buffet breakfast, there are many varieties.The environment is relatively quiet, and the central air conditioner is running normally.The waiter attitude is very good."
1,"很不错的酒店,性价比较高,酒店房间很干净,很安静","Very good hotel, the cost is relatively high, the hotel room is very clean, very quiet"
1,蓝天宾馆的服务绝对的好，每个宾馆员工见到每个客人都面带微笑，说：“你好！”服务很周到，餐厅的菜也很合口，设施很齐全，四星级的酒店有五星级的服务，我们一家人都很满意，决定下次去威海，还住蓝天宾馆。,"The service of the Blue Sky Hotel is absolutely good. Each hotel employee saw that every guest smiled and said, ""Hello!"" The service is very thoughtful.The five -star service, our family is very satisfied, decided to go to Weihai next time, and live in the Blue Sky Hotel."
1,条件，服务还是不错的，就是房间的隔音效果太差了.隔壁开灯关灯都听的清楚的很.另外就是浴室的水太小了。,"The conditions and services are still good, that is, the sound insulation effect of the room is too bad. The lights next door are very clear. In addition, the water in the bathroom is too small."
1,优点：1）和汽车站在一个院子内，出行便利2）斜对面就是大排挡一条街，各种小吃和水果一应俱全缺点：服务员态度一般，服务水平有待提高,"Advantages: 1) and the bus station in a yard, convenient travel 2) The opposite side is a large row of streets, all kinds of snacks and fruits have the disadvantages: the waiter's attitude is average, the service level needs to be improved"
1,总体感觉不错，191元/间的标间物有所值。,"Overall feels good, the standard between 191 yuan/room is worth it."
1,去过中茵皇冠公寓，味道太大。苏州索菲特，大堂装修尚可，房间和楼道太简单。只有尼盛万丽不错。。公司2次来人都住这里，非常不错。服务很好，很温馨。。房间也很好。。补充点评2008年1月20日：酒店四四方方的，太丑了。。。可是里面非常棒。绝对火的酒店。。。强烈推荐。。。就是早餐差了点，要是能有温州酒店的早餐就好了。,"I have been to Zhongyin Crown Apartment, which tastes too great.Suzhou Sofitt, the lobby is still available, the room and the corridor are too simple.Only Nicon Wanli is good.EssenceThe company lives here twice, which is very good.The service is very good and warm.EssenceThe room is also very good.EssenceSupplementary comment on January 20, 2008: The hotel's four or four parties, too ugly.EssenceEssenceBut inside is great.Absolutely hot hotel.EssenceEssencehighly recommended.EssenceEssenceIt is a bit worse for breakfast. If you can have breakfast at Wenzhou Hotel."
1,地处闹市但却非常的幽静，离衡山路很近，地铁也很方便，下次还住！,"It is located in the downturn but very quiet, very close to Hengshan Road, and the subway is also very convenient. I will live next time!"
1,酒店适合度假，在尖沙咀汉口道逢整点有免费班车往返，房间大小适中，可以躺在床上看海，儿子在游泳池里玩得不想上来，缺少浴袍。早餐还可以。,"The hotel is suitable for vacation. Every time there is a free shuttle bus at Hankou Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, the room size is moderate. You can lie on the bed to see the sea. The son does not want to play in the swimming pool and lacks a bathrobe.Breakfast is ok."
0,"你们说是3星的，环境好差，还没小旅店好，墙都发霉脱落，电视也是好久前的，连遥控器都没有,","You say that it is 3 stars, the environment is bad, there is no small hotel, the walls are moldy, the TV is also a long time ago, not even the remote control."
0,请协成不要再介绍是准四星未挂牌的该酒店，最好不要再与这家酒店合作，有损你们公司声誉。还不如好的招待所，只有表面功夫，位置很吵，旁边就是公路，服务很差，整个酒店很脏，床单，枕套，地毯。。。只能和衣而睡，半夜空调变暖气，热死你，浴室脏，不敢洗澡。早餐无法吃，餐具脏，食物差。在酒店的一家旅行社也很不正规。第二天立刻走人，心情差。补充点评2007年10月8日：当然服务生也很差,"Please do n’t introduce the hotel that is not listed in the quasi -four -star. It is best not to cooperate with this hotel to damage your company's reputation.It is not as good as a good guest house. There are only superficial kung fu and a noisy position. The road is next to it. The service is very poor. The entire hotel is dirty, sheets, pillows, carpets.EssenceEssenceI can only sleep with clothes. In the middle of the night, the air conditioning is heating, you die, the bathroom is dirty, and you dare not take a bath.Breakfast cannot be eaten, the tableware is dirty, and the food is poor.A travel agency in the hotel is also very unconventional.Walk away the next day and feel bad.Supplementary comment on October 8, 2007: Of course the waiter is also very poor"
1,6月17日入住两天，订的是半海景房。去的那天下着雨，因为不熟悉，坐地铁到上环站后走了二十多分钟才到，还淋了雨。前台接待态度非常好，可惜他说海景房满了，不能升级，比较遗憾。半海景房落地窗，能看到海，但与居民楼很近。房间比较干净，床比较大，和国内比显得房间有点小，不过据说在香港这样的大小房间已经很不错了。酒店服务很到位，坐酒店免费班车，送我们到港澳码头，就我和老公两人，司机态度挺不错。酒店出门左转就可以坐当当车，交通还算方便。而且后来才知道酒店离香港大学挺近，本来可以去港大散散步，下次有机会还可能再住。看了别人的点评，发现678的价是比较高的，携程在价格上好象没有优势。,"Two days on June 17, the semi -sea view room was booked.It was raining on the day when I went, because I was not familiar with it, I walked for more than twenty minutes after taking the subway to Shanghuan Station, and it was raining.The attitude of the front desk was very good. Unfortunately, he said that the sea view room was full and could not be upgraded. It was a pity.Mid -sea view rooms can see the sea, but it is close to the residential building.The room is relatively clean, the bed is relatively large, and the room is a bit smaller than that in China, but it is said that rooms such as Hong Kong are already very good.The hotel service is in place. Take the free shuttle bus and send us to Hong Kong and Macau terminals. The two of them and my husband and I have a good attitude.The hotel can take the left to take the left to take a car, and the traffic is quite convenient.And later I learned that the hotel was very close to the University of Hong Kong. I could have taken a walk to Hong Kong University. I might still stay again next time.After watching the comments of others, I found that the price of 678 is relatively high, and Ctrip seems to have no advantage in price."
1,"虽然酒店本身不能算是一家五星级酒店，但是从各方面来看，应该是珠海最好的酒店了，房间大而且也很清洁，配套基本上也齐，服务也到位，就是有一些小问题希望能解决，特别是房间跟通道的隔音做的不是太好，而且门缝透光，晚上睡觉的时候还歉帕艘徽蟆?><inputTYPE=补充点评2007年11月5日：想说的是晚上睡觉的时候还是受到了骚扰,另外补充早餐也做得挺好,一道炸鱼是我在广东吃过最好的.","Although the hotel itself cannot be regarded as a five -star hotel, from all aspects, it should be the best hotel in Zhuhai. The room is large and very clean. The supporting facilities are basically all.It can be solved, especially the sound insulation in the room and the channel is not very good, and the door seam is transmitted. When I go to bed at night?When I was sleeping at night, I was still harassed. In addition, I made a good breakfast. A fried fish was the best I have eaten in Guangdong."
1,设施较旧，但环境不错，价格还可以，没有早餐是件遗憾的事。,"The facilities are old, but the environment is good, the price is okay, and there is no breakfast. It is a pity."
1,"酒店环境,房间档次都很不错,服务水平专业.住了两天,感觉确实比较不错,二楼自助烧烤给人宾至如归的感觉","The hotel environment, the room level is very good, the service level is professional. I stayed for two days, and it feels really good. The self -service barbecue on the second floor gives the guests from returning home."
1,预定酒店很顺利。离西街较远，房间很有特色，古色古香，下次去阳朔再住这里,"The booking hotel is smooth.Far away from West Street, the room is very distinctive, antique, next time I go to Yangshuo and live here"
1,环境不错，空气新鲜幽静．离市中心有点远，但交通路况不错，适合有自驾车的城市人度假休闲．服务好，销售部的周小姐百问不厌，出门步行约５分钟有太湖船菜河鲜一条街，二十几个饭店营业到晚上十点，河鲜新鲜价廉，在湖州很有名．晚上停,"The environment is good, the air is fresh and quiet.It is a bit far from the city center, but the traffic conditions are good, and it is suitable for urban people with self -driving vacations.The service is good. Miss Zhou of the sales department has a good question. For about 5 minutes, there is a street in Taihu Shipai Caihe Xianjie Street. More than 20 restaurants are opened until 10 pm.Stop at night"
1,房间很整洁，尤其是床上的哪个靠枕是我以前所住过宾馆没有的，红色的很喜庆。虽然是在当地比较繁华的地区（对面就是欧尚，旁边都是饮食店），但是没有车马喧（我选的是9041）。唯一有两点不好，一点需要服务人员的时候要等较长时间，二是房间的隔音不是很理想。总的来说，值得一住。,"The room is clean, especially the pillow on the bed is not that I have lived in the hotel before. The red is very festive.Although it is a relatively prosperous area (opposite is Ou Shang, there are food shops next to it), there is no car and horse noise (I chose 9041).The only two points are not good. When you need a service personnel, you have to wait for a long time. The second is that the sound insulation in the room is not ideal.Overall, it is worth living."
0,前台接待太差，酒店有AB楼之分，本人check－in后，前台未告诉B楼在何处，并且B楼无明显指示；房间太小，根本不像4星级设施，下次不会再选择入住此店啦。,"The reception of the front desk is too bad. The hotel is divided into AB floor. After I check -in, the front desk does not tell where the B is located, and there is no obvious instructions in the B floor;Choose to stay in this shop."
0,作为香格里拉的金环行政级会员，每次入住香格里拉都有回家的感觉，但是中山香格里拉出现的一连串低级服务给我留下的及其恶劣的印象：1、订了到珠海机场接机服务，到达了机场出口没有看到接机人（第一次遇到这种情况），打电话到酒店催问，20分钟后车才到。2、订了豪华阁，在西楼16层豪华阁行政酒廊办理入住，却把房间安排在东楼的6楼，之间要走10多分钟。入住豪华阁就是要使用酒廊方便，为什么安排到很远的楼层，而且并没有征求我的意见。而且入住手续是所有香格里拉酒店耗时最长的一次（当时就是我一个人办理手续，应该有20分钟）。房间也是老旧，烟味浓重。对我说是升级到套房，但是如果事先说明，我绝对不会接受。而且订的另外一间豪华阁没有升级的也是安排到东楼六楼了，到底是为了什么？3、早餐在中餐厅有88元的双人套餐。我先到叫了几个点心，并且嘱咐服务员，等会我的客人到了将按照套餐单再点几个点心，这样就应该按照88元的套餐结帐。结果我的客人到了，服务员却又递给他一张零点的菜单，另外点的几个点心另外结帐。结果结帐付了150元。这点小钱也要赚？香格里拉堕落了！4、退房时要求开发票，事先不说明，就给两种发票：一种是手开的，一种是定额撕票。为什么不事先向客人说明一下再动手呢？一路不顺利！一向美好的香格里拉，在中山怎么堕落到这么差的地步了呢？严重不爽！,"As a Golden Ring administrative member of Shangri -La, every time I stay in Shangri -La, I feel like I go home, but a series of low -level services appearing in Shangri -La Zhongshan to me and their harsh impression: 1. I ordered to pick up the service at Zhuhai Airport.I arrived at the airport exit and did not see the pick -up person (the first time I encountered this). I called the hotel to ask questions. After 20 minutes, the car arrived.2. Book the luxury cabinet, and check in at the 16 -storey luxury cabinet of the West Building, but arrange the room on the 6th floor of the East Tower for more than 10 minutes.It is convenient to use the lounges to stay in the luxury cabinet. Why is it arranged to a far floor without asking me.And the check -in procedure is the longest time for all Shangri -La hotels (at that time I went through the procedures alone, there should be 20 minutes).The room is also old and the smell of smoke is strong.I said it was upgraded to the suite, but if I stated in advance, I would never accept it.And the other luxury cabinet is not upgraded to the sixth floor of Donglou. What is it for?3. Breakfast has a two -person package in Chinese restaurants.I first called a few snacks, and told the waiter to wait for my guests to order a few snacks according to the package, so that I should check out at the package of 88 yuan.As a result, my guests arrived, but the waiter handed him a zero -point menu, and a few dim sums at the time of the checkout.As a result, 150 yuan was paid at the checkout.Do you have to make a small money?Shangri -La has fallen!4. When checking out, you are required to invoiced. If you do not explain in advance, you will give two invoices: one is the hand -opened, and the other is a fixed tip.Why don't you explain to the guests in advance?Not going well all the way!The always beautiful Shangri -La has fallen to such a bad level in Zhongshan?Seriously uncomfortable!"
1,"大家说的都有一定道理,服务不错,很随和,房间干净,在旅游的地方信价比也算不错,晚上的表演还能看,就是没有原生态的歌手是个遗憾.","Everyone says that there is a certain reason, good service, very easy -going, clean room, the price ratio of the local tourism is also good, the performance of the night can still be seen. It is a pity that there is no original singer. It is a pity."

0,非常不行，三星的携程定290元，说景观房，其实什么都看不到，连大马路都不繁华。火车站附近佳丽4星，协议价298。只能说这变价高了，而且很老破破的样子，一点花园的感觉都没！其余一般。,"Very no, Samsung's Ctrip is 290 yuan, saying that the landscape room, in fact, can not be seen, and even the big road is not prosperous.Belle 4 stars near the railway station, the agreement price is 298.It can only be said that this price is high, and it looks very old, there is no feeling of garden!The rest."
0,我为朋友通过携程预订了该酒店。朋友入住时，宾馆里空房很多。但我的朋友居然被安排在空调漏水，墙面长期潮湿而发霉的房间。太不象话。经与宾馆人员交涉换了另外的房间。比第一间房好一些。,"I booked the hotel through Ctrip for my friends.When friends stayed, there were many empty rooms in the hotel.But my friend was actually arranged in the air conditioner leaking, and the walls of the wall were long and humid and moldy.Too unreasonable.After negotiating with the hotel staff, he changed another room.It's better than the first room."
0,要说明的是房价确实比较低，但是这也不能掩盖这个酒店的几个缺点。1，卫生不好，卫生间内有异味。2，服务意识不好，送上来的啤酒竟然没有开瓶的工具。3，商品不好，在这个酒店买的烟，好像是假烟。宾馆反馈2008年5月13日：感谢您的点评。经调查，您入住的是商务豪房，卫生间地漏确实有返味情况，我们将做处理；开瓶器今后将备好并随酒送至房间；酒店商品部所售烟均来自正规渠道，如您有担心可直接退换货。期待您再次光临并留下宝贵意见。,"It should be explained that house prices are indeed low, but this cannot cover several shortcomings of this hotel.1. Poor hygiene and odor in the bathroom.2. The awareness of service is not good. The beer sent from it has no tool for opening.3. The product is not good. The cigarettes bought in this hotel seem to be fake cigarettes.Hotel feedback on May 13, 2008: Thank you for your comments.After investigation, you are in the business mansion. The bathroom floor drain does have a backflage situation.

1,感觉不错，住了好几次了，交通比较方便。值得推荐。服务也可以，但是大厅可能不太起眼。,"It feels good, I have lived several times, and the traffic is more convenient.Recommended.The service is okay, but the hall may not be very eye -catching."
1,每次男朋友过来都住的这里，常住客人也没有任何优惠。情人节的套餐感觉还不错，前台服务不是很友好。但是因为考虑到地理位置和房间，还是一直很专注这里的。商务服务的价格太贵了。一张A4的黑白打印也要十块钱太不可思议了。,"Every time my boyfriend comes here, there are no discounts for permanent guests.The package of Valentine's Day feels good, and the front desk service is not very friendly.But because of the location and room, I have always been very focused on here.The price of business services is too expensive.It is too incredible to have ten dollars in A4's black and white printing."
1,"3月28日入住的,酒店外观老了一点,蛮像招待所的~不过里面倒还可以.车停后,门童马上来开了门,还帮我们拿行礼~登记入住了822房间,大床是用两个床拼起来的,不过睡起来倒还好;窗外的风景差了点.其他的服务都很好,设施也没得挑剔的.完全物有所值.要特别赞扬的是他们的服务,真的是很耐心,很优质.我们跟客房部要了碗,筷子,指甲刀等等(真不好意思啊~~~=P)每次都很快帮我们拿来了,而且服务态度很好,不错~","I stayed on March 28, the hotel's appearance was a bit old, and it was quite like a guest house ~ but it was okay inside. After the car was stopped, the door child immediately opened the door and helped us get a gift ~ Register to stay in Room 822, the big bed in the big bed, the big bedIt is used in two beds, but it is okay to sleep; the scenery outside the window is a bit worse. The other services are very good, and the facilities are not picky.Service is really patient and high -quality. We asked the guest room department for bowls, chopsticks, nail knives, etc. (I'm sorry ~~~ = P) I will help us quickly, and the service attitude isVery good, good ~"
1,可以将古城尽收眼底，地处离四方街不远的小巷里，出行方便，又很安静。老板娘人很好，服务也周到，住下来的感觉很舒服。,"You can see the ancient city at all, located in the alleys not far from Sifang Street. It is convenient and quiet.The boss and mother are very good, the service is thoughtful, and it feels comfortable to live."
1,"为什么协程的早餐要68元啊，我上次由于日期预定弄错了，到酒店才发现。总台按协程的价格给入住的，但早餐只要20元就可以了补充点评2007年11月1日：这次入住的是498的房间，用了早餐(68+10%),程的是68元。酒店的解是因用餐之前有和前打招呼，所以要收服务费的.岂有此理!!!协程也没在网上要我选择要不要预定早餐啊.我既然是通过协程预定了酒店,而且标注了早餐68的价格,我想入住的客人理所当然会以这个价格为准,和酒店交涉无果,只能交钱走人.","Why did the breakfast for the coroutine cost 68 yuan? I found out at the hotel because I was wrong because of the dated.The main station will stay at the price of the coroutine, but the breakfast is only 20 yuan to supplement the comments on November 1, 2007: This time I stayed in the room of 498, the breakfast (68+10%) was used.68 yuan.The hotel's solution is to say hello to and before the meal, so the service fee is to be charged. There is no reason !!! The coroutine has not asked me if I choose to book breakfast on the Internet. Since I have booked the hotel through the coroutine, and marked the marksThe price of breakfast 68. Of course, the guests I want to stay will take this price, and the negotiation with the hotel will be fruitless. I can only pay for it."
0,"从未住过的这么差的5星级酒店,一家人开车去玩,8月8日通过携程要了三间景观房,其中一间打开房门居然里面已住了客人,5星级酒店出现钥匙牌搞错这种情况真是闻所未闻.换房后晚上在酒店的""亭下""厅吃饭居然在汤圆里吃到了一大块塑料纸,找服务员后同意退了.回房后1221房的钥匙牌居然又打不开房门了(刚进去时可以打开),叫来服务员打开后,房间电话又是坏的,再叫来服务员维修,住进去短短的二个小时时间,碰到了4个倒霉的情况,本来在这特殊的日子里好好看奥运开幕式的心情已全无了,实在让人扫兴.第二天一早好好看了一下房间,发现床头灯罩上满是灰尘,很呕心,这种5星级酒店真是连3星都不如,真是太差太差了.","The 5 -star hotel that has never lived in such a poor 5 -star hotel, the family drove to play.

After changing the room, I ate a large piece of plastic paper in the dumplings in the ""Pavilion"" hall in the hotel at night. After looking for the waiter, I agreed to retreat.Actually I can't open the door again (I can open it when I first entered). After the waiter opened it, the room phone was bad again.In the case, the mood of watching the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in this special day was gone. It really made people look good. I looked at the room early the next morning and found that the bedside lampshade was full of dust, very worried, this is very worried, this is very worried. This is very worried. This is very worried.Planting a 5 -star hotel is really not even as good as 3 stars, it is too bad and too bad."
0,"服务基本上没有！非常失望，其酒店的服务和周围的优雅环境很不相称...总而言之,非常失望,更不用谈性价比了.","The service is basically not!Very disappointed, the service of its hotel is disappeared with the elegant environment around me ... In short, it is very disappointed, let alone the cost -effectiveness."
1,"酒店脚摩很有特色,住客还可以打8折,房间装修尚可,位置稍偏","The hotel's feet are very distinctive, the residents can also be 20 % off, the room decoration is acceptable, the location is slightly different."
0,酒店位置距离南苑机场打车￥31元。性价比差。建议住大红门附近，距南苑机场近些。,"The hotel location is ￥ 31 from Nanyuan Airport.Poor cost -effective.It is recommended to live near Dahongmen, which is closer to Nanyuan Airport."

1,"酒店各都很好,值得推!不附近就什商店或好吃的,要西或日用品就要先再外了!补充点评2008年6月20日：前台不懂州的,不不成,的可以!=)宾馆反馈2008年7月4日：酒店反馈：非常感谢您对酒店的认可！1）在此向您介绍一下酒店周围的商场和餐厅：酒店在银桦路上，您出酒店大门往右沿银桦路步行约2钟是个十字路口，与银桦路交接的叫兴业路，此时您可看到马路对面许多风味餐厅如北方印象（东北菜）、洞庭村酒家（湖南菜）、奇摩咖啡厅（情调不错）、小肥羊火锅、大碗粥（广东特色）、韩国烤肉等等，价位适中。著名的家乐福超市就在这条路上。若您出酒店大门转左沿银桦路步行30秒，可以见到毛家饭店（湖南菜）、广东特色烤蚝。再往前走几分钟有一大型商场（茂业百货），内有肯德基餐厅等风味小吃。2）关于日用品您可以在酒店客房中心购买。3）酒店正在加强培训前台同事学习广东话。希望您下次入住能更加满意！","The hotels are very good, it is worth pushing!

1,"天津为数不多的还可以的酒店,比喜来登,凯悦好多了.酒吧设施差了点,健身房差了点.","There are not many hotels in Tianjin, which is much better than Sheraton. Hyatt is much better. The bar facilities are a bit worse, and the gym is a bit worse."
1,酒店的价格是越来越贵了，不过宽带不收费还是不错的。酒店正在装修，比较闹，不过晚上就没有了。,"The price of the hotel is getting more and more expensive, but the broadband does not charge good.The hotel is being renovated and more troubled, but it is gone at night."
0,就这样的宾馆也敢要298元，跟诈骗差不多，宾馆的前台就像饭馆的收银台，服务态度极差，跟头脑缺根弦似的。洗澡的水也不热，房间隔音差，早餐不好，如果你收个180元左右还查不多，我说的合理吧，就这酒店还敢如此要价，携程网的工作人员到底有没有实地考察过，能不能为用户多负责一下，真是让人不愿意再在这里订酒店。,"The hotel is also 298 yuan, which is similar to fraud. The front desk of the hotel is like the restaurant's cashier. The service attitude is very poor and like the head lack of roots.The water in the bath is not hot, the room has a poor sound insulation, and the breakfast is not good. If you receive about 180 yuan, you will not check it much. I said it is reasonable. In this hotel, the hotel daresAfter investigating, it is really unwilling to book a hotel here."
1,这是我帮外国客人订的房间，他们第一次来中国。这样的价钱，这样的酒店，还是很满意的。而且酒店本来就不错。,"This is the room I booked by foreign guests, and they have come to China for the first time.Such a price, such a hotel is still very satisfied.And the hotel is pretty good."
1,是我第二次入住，因在是四星，所以格很便宜，住的也很不。我大就是在重上的~酒店的地理位置特好！下就是好吃街~~胖子的串串香你吃到忘不了！有好友的刨冰和酸辣粉也超棒的！只要你看到他子前排著的人就知道偶的不啦~~~酒店的最好的理由就是：酒店的服和生都很好；交通超便利；吃嘛~包你能吃到重所有的小吃！~~也是偶住的酒店~~~补充点评2007年6月10日：看到下朋友的，偶很吃~~我住的豪，在10的，生件挺好的呀！以前05年的候我也住一次~~都挺不的呀~他的那么差~~,"It was my second stay. Because it was four stars, the grid was very cheap and the living was not very good.I am on the top ~ The geographical location of the hotel is very good!It's delicious street ~~ You can't forget the chips of the fat man!Friends' shaved ice and hot and sour powder are also great!As long as you see the people in front of his son, you know that the best reason is it ~~~ The best reason for the hotel is: the hotel's service and life are very good; the transportation is super convenient;All snacks!~~ It ’s also a hotel where I live ~~~ Add comments on June 10, 2007: I saw my friends, I eat it very much ~~ I live in the hero.

1,"对本次入住的酒店,感觉很不错,因为我本人蛮注重环境的,每次入住酒店都会查看点评的,所以选了这间酒店,地方也很好找的,我们入住的是395的房间,但是他们给了我们一个价值888的房间给我们体验,真是太舒服了,早餐是价值88元的,很丰富,真的是超赞的,极力推荐!!!!!!!!!!!1","I feel very good for the hotel where I stayed in this time, because I pay attention to the environment, and I will check the review every time I stay in the hotel, so I chose this hotel, and the place is also very easy to find. We stay in the room of 395.But they gave us a room worth 888 for us to experience. It was so comfortable. Breakfast was worth 88 yuan, rich, really amazing, highly recommended !!!!!!!!!!! 1"
1,第二次来石狮出差，经石狮客户及网络推荐入住五洲，总体感觉还是挺温馨的，服务员很礼貌，管理很到位，只是有一样不太好，晚上六点钟之后订不到中餐包厢，真是美中不足。,"For the second time I came to the stone lion on a business trip, I was recommended to stay in Wuzhou through the stone lion customer and the Internet. The overall feeling is still very warm. The waiter is polite and the management is in place. It is not very good.a fly in the ointment."
1,我8月19日入住标准间（268元）一晚，房间、卫生间都比较宽敞，虽然装修和家具旧了些，但卫生不错，外面的噪音不大，有小冰箱，晚上送水果和报纸，早上有自助早餐，结帐速度快。出行也很方便，酒店离人民广场步行需5、6分钟，打车到火车站7元，要到北戴河海滨，从酒店步行10分钟到公交车站，坐34路车大约40分钟到海滨，票价2元。旅游旺季的时候在北戴河住条件不好还很贵（四、五百元就住个招待所的标准），住在秦皇岛条件好多了，下次还会考虑住在这里。,"I stayed in the standard room (268 yuan) for one night on August 19th. The rooms and bathrooms were relatively spacious. Although the decoration and furniture were old, the sanitary was good. The noise outside was not large.There is a buffet breakfast in the morning, and the checkout speed is fast.It is also very convenient to travel. The hotel takes 5 or 6 minutes to walk from the People's Square. It takes 7 yuan to take a taxi to the train station. It is necessary to go to the Beidaihe seaside, and walk from the hotel for 10 minutes to the bus station.2 yuan.During the peak tourist season, the conditions for living in Beidaihe are not good (the standard of living in a guest house in four or five hundred yuan). Living in Qinhuangdao is much better, and you will consider living here next time."
0,地段马马乎乎。但这个楼本来就像写字楼一样，大部分都是人家办公的地方，少部分楼层是客房。房间不大，设施也有点旧的样子，早餐更是残不目睹。我真的觉得他能评上3星是奇迹,"The location is horses.But this building was originally like an office building. Most of them were places where they were working. A small number of floors were guest rooms.The room is not large, the facilities are a bit old, and breakfast is even more inconspicuous.I really think he can comment on 3 stars as a miracle"
1,"该酒店硬件与福州\厦门挂三酒店相比差不多,酒店外围绿化环境比别的酒店要大,停车场很宽阔,最让我满意的是酒店介绍的散客自驾游经济\宽松很适合我们散客自助的需求入住武夷山酒店愉快心情也和这两天的股市大涨分不开的我个人建议大家到武夷山可以考虑入住这家酒店","The hotel's hardware is similar to that of Fuzhou \ Xiamen Hangsan Hotel.

1,西式建筑，别有风味，可以看出设计建造者非常用心的，很多细节包括装修都做到用材精良。但毕竟是99年的，有些地方已经看出了陈旧落伍，非常奇怪现在的管理者为什么这么小气地经营，譬如至少可以把电视机换得大一些，床垫似乎也太久了软塌塌的不舒服，连这一点钱都不舍得投资吗。服务人员倒是很客气，到处看的都是笑脸，而且很耐心，看得出很想把工作做到完美。但是有些习惯还都是宾馆的，完全暴露了管理者的不专业。譬如在露台茶吧喝茶时居然有大队人马涌进来参观风景（看起来是熟人带来的）。这个酒店的外部环境是非常好的，有这么好外部环境的酒店非常少，这么优美的地方，应该配上专业的团队管理，才称得上完美。,"Western -style buildings have unique flavors. It can be seen that the design builders are very attentive. Many details include the decoration of the decoration.But after all, it is in 1999. Some places have already seen the old fall. It is very strange why the manager now operates so small. For example, at least the TV can be replaced. The mattress seems to be too long.Uncomfortable, don't you even want to invest in this money?The service staff is very polite. They look at the smile everywhere, and they are very patient. They can see that they want to make the work perfect.However, some habits are also hotels, which completely expose the unprofessional manager.For example, when drinking tea on the terrace tea bar, there are actually brigade people who come in to visit the scenery (it looks like it is brought by acquaintances).The external environment of this hotel is very good. There are very few hotels with such a good external environment. Such a beautiful place should be accompanied by professional team management to be perfect."
0,五一节期间入住，建筑挺宏伟，车开到酒店门口没有人理你或引导你停车到位，询问哪里有停车，被答复没有，后来自己,"Checking in during May 1st, the building is quite magnificent. No one cares about you or guides you to park in front of the hotel. Ask where there is a parking, but the answer is not. Later"
1,自驾的确是蛮方便的．服务员也都很热情．房间也不错．就是大概是秋冬季节去的，景色萧瑟的很．一出酒店就没什么逛的．还是窝在酒店好．ps：酒店的叫餐服务也蛮周到的．可以点菜单上没有的菜．但是却不能提供一些基本的药品：如退烧药，感冒药．希望周边服务还能加强．,"Self -driving is indeed quite convenient.The waiters are also very enthusiastic.The room is also good.It is probably the autumn and winter seasons, and the scenery is very small.There is nothing to visit as soon as I leave the hotel.It's better to nest in the hotel.PS: The hotel's call service is also quite thoughtful.You can order the dishes not on the menu.But it cannot provide some basic medicines: such as antipyretic medicine, cold medicine.It is hoped that the surrounding services can be strengthened."
1,"不像宾馆,像政府招待所.我晚10点回酒店就没有餐饮供应了,打车很不方便,要步行3-5分钟才能到临街的马路,设施陈旧,结帐时的清单还要另外到商务中心打印,很耗时间.补充点评2007年3月11日：还要补充一点,早餐质量很差,品种极少,以中餐为主,服务员毫不专业,要煎蛋得到后厨做,人多时服务员就忘记了.","Unlike a hotel, like a government guest house. I returned to the hotel at 10 pm and there was no dining supply. It was inconvenient to take a taxi. You need to walk for 3-5 minutes to go to the street on the street.

Supplementation reviews March 11, 2007: It is necessary to add a little bit, the quality of breakfast is very poor, there are very few varieties, mainly Chinese food.The waiter forgot."
1,去年无意中帮朋友预定过一次这个酒店，后来朋友每次来都要我预定这个酒店，我自己住过一次，也觉得感觉还不错，出行也很方便。,"Last year, I accidentally booked this hotel once. Later, every time my friends came to book the hotel, I lived in my own, and I felt that it felt good, and it was very convenient to travel."
1,不错，在普宁寺旁边，有特色。服务员态度特别好，很亲切，都穿藏服。,"Yes, next to Puning Temple, there are characteristics.The waiter has a good attitude, very kind, and wearing a collection."
1,"每次出差都住这家宾馆,这次来住,宾馆内又有了新的变化,一进房间就看到桌子上放着一盘精美的水果,家具也都是全新的,问过服务员才知道,他们又进行了装修.不但是房间有变化,服务员的服务也更加的热情,周到了,让人感觉很舒服,很温馨!我每次来都住不同的房间,感觉上网的网速也非常流畅,洗澡水挺好的,卫生间里的防滑及安全设施非常齐全到位.宾馆送的大礼包(免费宽带,免费水果,免费接站,接机,免费早餐)感觉真的很实惠.毕竟是一家三星级宾馆,从各方面来说都做的非常到位了.我建议其他驴友到敦煌无论是出差还是旅游,都住这家宾馆,真的很不错!宾馆反馈2008年7月23日：非常感谢您对本宾馆的肯定,本宾馆全体员工将以更优质的服务期待您的再次光临!","Every time I travel around, I live in this hotel. This time I stayed, and there were new changes in the hotel. As soon as I entered the room, I saw a plate of exquisite fruits on the table. The furniture was also brand new.Knowing that they were renovated again. Not only did the room change, but the waiter's service is also more enthusiastic. It is thoughtful and makes people feel very comfortable and warm! Every time I come to live in different rooms, I feel that the Internet speed of the Internet is also the Internet speed.Very smooth, the bath water is very good, the non -slip and safety facilities in the bathroom are in place. The gift package sent by the hotel (free broadband, free fruit, free pick -up, pick -up, free breakfast) It feels really affordable.

1,服务还可以，价格不贵，周边交通还是比较方便，早餐一般，可选比较少,"The service is okay, the price is not expensive, the surrounding transportation is still more convenient, the breakfast is average, and the choice is relatively small"
0,还有一个问题就是，酒店的早餐品种太少，而且味道也很一般，早餐的牛奶不是鲜奶，而且没有果汁。不过房间送餐倒是还行，特别是15块的水果沙拉，每天都要点一份。,"Another problem is that there are too few breakfast in the hotel, and the taste is very average. Breakfast milk is not fresh milk, and there is no juice.However, the room delivery is OK, especially the 15 pieces of fruit salads, you have to order a copy every day."
1,不错的，已经不是第一次住了。房间大，环境不错。背后是大学的女生宿舍，呵呵。,"Yes, it's not the first time to live.The room is large and the environment is good.Behind it is the girl's dormitory of the university, haha."
1,"这个酒店感觉性价比比较高.房间价格不算高,但里面环境还是不错的,房间里也比较干净,下次要是再去周庄还是会选择这家酒店的.","This hotel feels more cost -effective. The price of the room is not high, but the environment is still good, and the room is relatively clean. Next time, if you go to Zhouzhuang again, you will choose this hotel."
1,我是五一到二王庙宾馆的，有个新发现：就是都江堰景区与二王庙景点相通的。如果你从二王庙宾馆出来向前走约50米，就可以看到都江堰的一个入门口，买门票就可以进入景区，沿着景区往下游玩的话，可以一直到都江堰的正大门，也正好是山下都江堰市区了。反过来游玩也行。所以如果想去都江堰玩景区的，住二王庙宾馆是十分的方便。而且宾馆内部环境很幽雅，绿树成林，早晨还有一种鸟叫，听起来象个男人在练嗓子一样，真是很好玩．,"I was from the May 1st to the Erwang Temple Hotel. There was a new discovery: the Dujiangyan scenic area was connected with the attractions of the Erwang Temple.If you come from the Erwangmiao Hotel to walk for about 50 meters, you can see a entrance of Dujiangyan. If you buy tickets, you can enter the scenic area. If you play down the scenic area, you can go to the gate of Dujiangyan.It is the urban area of the mountains under the mountain.Conversely, it can be played.So if you want to go to Dujiangyan to play the scenic spot, it is very convenient to live in the Erwangmiao Hotel.Moreover, the internal environment of the hotel is very elegant, and the green trees are forest. There is also a bird name in the morning. It sounds like a man is practicing his throat. It is really fun."
1,服人度都很好，人感馨。也近，物用餐都方便。我是程房，也住多次，提了一，感受用的。1001房浴室有小毛病，盆排水不太，桶有法位，水，或是使用多次後的毛病。前台也有往香港的大巴票，但得自行搭的士到的地方去搭。,"The people are very good and hearty.It is also near, and it is convenient to dine.I was Chengfang, I also lived many times, I mentioned it, and I felt it.There are minor problems in the room in the room of 1001, and the pelvic drainage is not too much. The barrel has a method, water, or after using multiple times.There are also buses to Hong Kong at the front desk, but they have to go to the place where they come."
1,酒店的服务、设施都非常不错，就是网速非常的慢。离机场很近。各方面都非常的好，安静，温暖。是个非常不错的选择。不过没有尝试酒店的按摩服务，非常后悔，其实酒店的按摩服务很安全，希望尝试了的朋友能在下面的帖子告诉我，谢谢！我很期待再去机场酒店！,"The hotel's service and facilities are very good, that is, the network speed is very slow.Very close to the airport.All aspects are very good, quiet and warm.It is a very good choice.However, I did n’t try the hotel's massage service. I regret it very much. In fact, the hotel ’s massage service is safe. I hope that friends who have tried can tell me in the post below, thank you!I am looking forward to going to the airport hotel again!"
0,还在出租车上，司机就开始问我，为什么要订这个酒店，说它实在不咋地，我以为是司机想把我拉到别的酒店，好赚点拉客钱，没想到，这车一路开，过了繁华地段，来到一个偏僻的角落，而且我看到的还是一个看似招待所的宾馆，第一印象：差！！进到宾馆，看它的前台，用东北话描述：磕碜！！简直是地道的招待所，别说三星，二星都算不上！！！而且网上说的是有免费宽带的，我一问，不是每间房都有的，而且刚好，我要订的房就没有。。。。简直是郁闷。。第二天，要插线板，拿来一个特别小的，不能用，我让前台帮我再去买一个，钱我自己出，人家回复：现在已经买不到了，我不能上网，不能回复邮件，有可能一下子就会损失10几万！！,"Still on the taxi, the driver began to ask me why I booked this hotel, saying that it was really not good.

1,我订的是豪华单人房，其实也就是普通标房的水准。其他都还好，但是我那天住的房间有非常非常重的霉味，由于是深夜入住，也没有别的选择只好将就了，但以后绝对不会接受。交通便利，适合想我这样路过办事的旅客。但是到风景区还有点远，到度假村会有更好的选择。,"I ordered a luxurious single room, which is actually the standard of ordinary standard rooms.The others were okay, but the room I lived on the day had a very, very heavy moldy smell. Because it was staying at night, there was no other choice that I had to be, but I would never accept it in the future.Convenient transportation, suitable for passengers who pass by doing things like me.But there is still a little far away in the scenic area, and there will be better choices in the resort."
1,入住了行政客房，总体来说，酒店还不错，服务员的素质也比较高。尤其是行政楼层的服务员值得表扬。中餐馆的杭帮菜很好吃，环境也还不错，值得推荐！说说缺点吧：地方有一点偏，离西湖大约15分钟车程，打车不容易，不过与房价匹配来看也算合理。但最后一天退房时，我们已经提前和前台约定了车辆，可是到楼下居然还要等很长时间，实在是让我们本来的好心情大打折扣！,"In the administrative room, in general, the hotel is not bad, and the quality of the waiter is relatively high.Especially the waiters on the administrative floor are worthy of rare.Hangbang's food in Chinese restaurants is delicious and the environment is not bad. It is worth recommending!Talk about the disadvantages: There is a little bit of the place, about 15 minutes away from the West Lake. It is not easy to take a taxi, but it is reasonable to match the house prices.But on the last day of checkout, we already agreed with the vehicle in advance from the front desk, but it took a long time to go downstairs. It really made our original good mood greatly reduced!"
0,1.早餐是我迄今为止见到的最差的!简直绝无仅有啊!还好有几个鸡蛋可以稍微安慰一下肚子.2.地毯好像经过2次描绘:地毯+污垢!,"1. Breakfast is the worst I have seen so far! It's unique! Fortunately, there are a few eggs that can comfort the stomach slightly. 2. The carpet seems to be depicted 2 times: carpet+dirt!"
1,去上海一般都住这家，地段还不错，交通也比较方便，房间很大也比较干净，就是江景房有点差（以前住过，很小），一般标房就可以了，套房也很不错（有厨房，够大），每件房都有冰箱，很好，就是宽带不是免费的，一天好像要80吧，太贵了,"It usually lives in Shanghai, the location is not bad, the transportation is more convenient, and the room is very large and clean.The kitchen is large enough). Each room has a refrigerator. It is good, but the broadband is not free. It seems to be 80 a day. It's too expensive."
1,"酒店的整体感觉一般,但是前台的小姐和先生很热情.但是酒店的餐厅只接受现金,很不方便.希望能把帐转入房间号中.","The overall feeling of the hotel is average, but the lady and gentleman at the front desk are very enthusiastic. But the hotel's restaurant only accepts cash, which is very inconvenient. I hope to transfer the account to the room number."
1,"酒店的地理位置不错,价格有竞争力,服务也不错,是值得推荐的酒店.","The hotel's geographical location is good, the price is competitive, and the service is also good. It is a recommended hotel."
1,外观很有特点，长城外观，显然白天为了省电，大堂不开灯。。。似乎感觉上入住的人数有点少，另外就是入住手续有点意思，开什么入住通知书等等。。。,"The appearance is very characteristic. The appearance of the Great Wall is obviously in order to save power during the day, and the lobby does not turn on the lights.EssenceEssenceIt seems that the number of people who feel a little bit less, and the other is a bit interesting to stay in, what kind of notification notice, and so on.EssenceEssence"
1,房间小但很干净。入住时办理手续的时间较长，退房办手续时速度极快。总体基本满意,"The room is small but very clean.The procedures for check -in at the time of check -in are relatively long, and the speed of check -in processing is extremely fast.Overall is basically satisfied"
1,位置好离盈科中心非常近，而且离工体和三里屯都比较近，如果晚上没事走路均可到达，下次如果再去盈科还住，推荐。,"The location is very close to Yingke Center, and it is closer to the workers and Sanlitun. If you can walk at night, you can reach it. If you go to Yingke to live next time, it is recommended."
1,连续入住好几次了。将来可能没有机会再到湖南这家店却是还可以,"Stayed in several consecutive times.There may be no chance to go to this store in Hunan in the future, but it is okay"
1,"优点：酒店大门外开阔，大堂够宽敞,服务好,离西湖近．不足：刚装修的四个楼层还是有很强的刺激气味，作为５星级标准，房间小了点．宾馆反馈2008年5月16日：非常抱歉，由于部分楼层于2007年11月-2008年2月进行了装修，有些房间还些味道。酒店于3月初装修完工后，除了进行日常通风除味工作以外，特别请专业公司对新装修楼层的楼道，房间进行了光触媒净化处理。光触媒是一种无毒无害的健康型净化空气材料，具有极强的杀菌、除臭、防霉、防污自洁、净化空气功能。为酒店提供净化服务的公司也曾经为杭州多家高星级酒店做过空气净化处理，所使用光触媒产品经过质量监督所的严格验证。尽管我们已采取各种措施使您的休息和健康不受影响，我们仍希望为任何可能因此而带来的不便向您致歉，并真诚期待您的谅解和支持。","Advantages: The door of the hotel is wide, the lobby is spacious, the service is good, and it is close to West Lake.Insufficient: The four floors just renovated still have a strong stimulating smell. As a 5 -star standard, the room is a bit smaller.Hotel feedback on May 16, 2008: Sorry, because some floors were renovated from November 2007 to February 2008, some rooms also flavored.After the hotel was completed in early March, in addition to the daily ventilation and taste work, special companies were invited to professional companies to purify the new decoration floor channel.Photocatalyst is a non -toxic and harmless healthy purification air material, which has strong sterilization, deodorization, mildew -proof, anti -firing self -cleaning, and purifying air.Companies providing purification services for hotels have also done air purification treatment for many high -star hotels in Hangzhou. The use of light catalyst products has been strictly verified by quality supervision.Although we have taken various measures to prevent your rest and health from being unhappy, we still want to apologize to you for any inconvenience that may bring, and sincerely look forward to your understanding and support."
1,酒店周边环境一般，酒店内设施不错，感觉还挺新，价格也尚可接受。,"The surrounding environment of the hotel is average. The hotel's facilities are good, it feels quite new, and the price is acceptable."
1,酒店的服务不错，我去是预定的豪华大床间，后来因为没有我预定的房间类型，自动给我升级到商务套房。这点还是让人比较舒服。另外早餐现在也还可以。就是因为距离机场比较不远，飞机的噪音比较大。宾馆反馈2008年3月14日：尊敬的客人，您好，非常感谢您对厦门丽轩酒店的服务及早餐的认可，对于酒店的软件服务，我们一直在改进。另外噪音问题，酒店于2007年5月份经过重新装修，很大程度上解决了噪音问题。欢迎您的下次光临！,"The hotel's service is good. I went to the predetermined luxury bed. Later, because I did not have the type of room I booked, I automatically upgraded me to a business suite.This is still more comfortable.In addition, breakfast is okay now.It is because it is not far from the airport, and the noise of the aircraft is relatively large.Hotel feedback on March 14, 2008: Dear guests, hello, thank you very much for your service and breakfast for Xiamen Lixuan Hotel. We have been improving for hotel software services.In addition, the noise problem, the hotel was renovated in May 2007, which largely solved the noise problem.Welcome your next visit!"
1,属于酒店式公寓，房间比较温馨，不过淋浴房太小了，淋浴设施也比较陈旧。酒店的地段很好，紧邻解放碑步行街，离轻轨站也很近。退房的速度相当慢，早上退房基本上都要等20分钟以上，人手太少，前台的服务态度还是相当不错的。总体而言性价比不错。,"It belongs to a hotel -style apartment. The room is relatively warm, but the shower room is too small and the shower facilities are relatively old.The hotel is very good. It is close to Jiefangbei Pedestrian Street, and it is very close to the light rail station.The speed of checking out is quite slow. Basically, the check -up and check -out in the morning will have to wait more than 20 minutes. There are too few people, and the service attitude of the front desk is quite good.Overall, it is cost -effective."
1,前台服务员礼貌好，房间干净整齐，热水的确有忽冷忽热的现象，但影响不大。价格小贵，只值200元以下。,"The front desk waiter is polite, the room is clean and tidy, and the hot water does have the phenomenon of cold and hot, but the impact is not great.The price is small and expensive, only worth less than 200 yuan."
1,位置方便，内部环境与卫生较好，但价格略高些。,"The location is convenient, the internal environment and hygiene are better, but the price is slightly higher."
0,9月30日我给朋友（从德国来湖南打算去张家界）预订了2间房1晚，第2天早上结帐时服务员硬说房间少了1个衣架，我朋友只好上去6楼看，结果是服务员数错了。我朋友很生气，说酒店服务员数数都数不清吗？发生这样的事，让客人感觉到很不愉快，同时耽误了客人结帐的时间。,"On September 30th, I gave my friends (I planned to go to Zhangjiajie from Germany) to book two rooms for 1 night. On the morning of the second day, the waiter said that the room was missing one less. My friend had to go to the 6th floor to see.The waiter was wrong.My friend was very angry, and said that the number of hotel waiters could not count?This happened to make the guests feel unhappy, and at the same time delayed the guests' checkout time."
0,酒店设施老化，服务互相推委，没有4星的设施怎能享受4星的服务，连空调都不能用的4星，餐饮就是大众食堂的标准，价格是`````````,"The hotel facilities are aging, the service is promoted to each other, and there are no 4 -star facilities to enjoy the service of 4 stars. Even 4 stars that cannot be used by air conditioners are the standard of the Volkswagen Canteen. The price is `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `"
0,Thepositionofthishotelisverybad.补充点评2008年4月6日：1。没有暖气2。有人评论“房间有窗打不开，窗户有玻璃不透明，房间显得非常闷”，试过打开窗户，看到很多坟墓,"TheposityOFTHISHOTELISVERYBAD. Supplementary comment on April 6, 2008: 1.No heating 2.Some people commented that ""the rooms cannot be opened, the windows are opaque, and the room looks very stuffy."" Try to open the window and see a lot of grave"
1,总体还可以，早餐很丰富，我一般吃过早饭连午饭都不用吃了。没有像其他人说的那些问题，不过最不能忍受的是房间的味道真的是难闻，应该是中水的味道吧，我几乎是天天开窗。,"Overall, breakfast is rich, I usually don't have to eat breakfast and lunch.There are no problems like others, but the most unbearable taste is that the taste of the room is really unpleasant. It should be the taste of Zhongshui. I almost open the window every day."
1,"除了离机场近,没什么可说的了.应该没有5星的.","Except that it is close to the airport, there is nothing to say. There should be no 5 stars."
0,方便倒是真方便。可是晚上噪音太大了。正好是个十字路口。整个晚上全过车。鸣笛不止。睡觉轻的还是不要去住了,Convenience is really convenient.But the noise at night is too big.It happens to be a crossroad.The whole night passed through the car.The whistle is not only.Do n’t live lightly when you sleep lightly
1,"第一次入住这家酒店也是携程推荐的,当时还叫台北商务,这次改名红山新世纪了.房间一样价格却是优惠了许多.酒店维护的不错,和原来没有什么变化还是很新.到是没有先前的装修味了.前台对携程客人的服务很周到,入住时已是凌晨1点多了,第二天补送了果盘,还不忘提醒免洗衣的事感动!房间很大,配置也很全,特别是太妃躺椅.透过落地窗就可以看见红山.床大而且舒适,要是有睡惯的荞麦皮枕头就更好了,卫生间也不小,两瓶康师傅矿泉水还是免费的.房间卫生也不错,仔细检查了一番,到是没有发现楼下网友所描述的现象.最大的变化:上网\下载的速度好快.光纤的感觉就是不一样!总得说是一家性价比很高的酒店,值得推荐!宾馆反馈2008年4月21日：尊敬的客人，非常感谢您再次入住我们酒店。温馨提示：下次入住酒店后请致电房务中心，那里有专门为客人提供使用的荞麦皮枕头。您的点评说明酒店在“人性化”服务方面做得不够细致，需再加强。期待您的再次光临。","The first time I stayed in this hotel was also recommended by Ctrip. At that time, it was also called Taipei Business. This time, it was renamed Hongshan New Century. The price of the room was a lot preferential. The hotel maintenance was good, and there was no change in the original.There is no previous decoration. The service of Ctrip guests at the front desk is very thoughtful. It was already more than 1 o'clock in the morning when I stayed. The fruit plate was given the next day.The configuration is also very complete, especially the concubine lounge chair. You can see Hongshan. The bed is large and comfortable through the floor -to -ceiling window.Well. The room hygiene is also good. I checked it carefully. I did not find the phenomenon described by netizens downstairs. The biggest change: The speed of downloading the Internet \ is good.High hotels are worth recommending! Hotel feedback on April 21, 2008: Dear guests, thank you very much for staying in our hotel again.Reminder: Please call the Housing Center after staying at the hotel next time, where there are buckwheat leather pillows that are used to provide guests.Your comments show that the hotel is not meticulous enough in terms of ""humanization"" services and needs to be strengthened.welcome next time."
0,"有或者很少房!梯部不吸,但是有一些吸者仍然有服!我是不抽的人,成二手的受害者!(中13人口中,民只有3.2.不到1/4!!!)看到的民,自好?.","There are few rooms! The ladder does not suck, but some sucks still have service! I am a victim who does not smoke! (Among the 13 people, the people are only 3.2. Less than 1/4 !!!) Seeing the people, hello?.."
1,黄金地段，算是性价比比较高的吧，但是环境一般~~,"The golden area is considered to be more cost -effective, but the environment is average ~~"
0,我们于11月初入住该酒店450元/天房间。感觉还行。就是客房把一次性睡衣和不收费睡衣放在一起，外包装一样。一次性睡衣收费98元，只要开封即视为使用。问题在于2种睡衣放在一起，且没有明显标示。而且该酒店没有窗户，室内光线也不好，如果没有把2个睡衣拿起来仔细分辨很容易就随便拿一个算了，把一次性睡衣撕开包装口。作为服务行业的酒店是不是该提供鲜明的收费标识说明，以免客户发生错误？,"We stayed at the hotel 450 yuan/day room in early November.It feels okay.The guest room is placed together with one -time pajamas and not charging pajamas, and the outer packaging is the same.The one -time pajamas charges is 98 yuan, as long as Kaifeng is considered to be used.The problem is that two kinds of pajamas are placed together without obvious labeling.In addition, the hotel has no windows, and the indoor light is not good. If you do n’t take it up with two pajamas, you can just take one and tear off the packaging mouth.Should the hotels in the service industry provide a clear charging identification instructions to prevent customers from errors?"
1,"性价比非常好的酒店，房间设施超好，卫生间分了3个部分，淋浴房，卫生间，化妆间，非常干净，装修很有欧式风格，枕头舒服，床也大,服度也不,商房配,下次!","The cost -effective hotel, the room facilities are super good, the bathroom has three parts, shower room, bathroom, dressing room, very clean, decoration is very European style, the pillow is comfortable, the bed is also large, the service is not, the house is matched,,next time!"
0,"完全达不到四星标准,前台小姐臭着一张脸,南楼的服务小姐还是瞒热情的.被子有一股怪味,洗手间地板不整洁,电视没有国际台,半夜还接到按摩小姐的电话.唯一觉得还可以的是中餐厅的菜还可以.用餐也不贵.",It is not enough to meet the four -star standard. The lady of the front desk is smelly. The service lady in the South Tower is still enthusiastic. The quilt has a strange smell. The floor of the bathroom is unclean.The only thing that I think can still be the food in the Chinese restaurant. It is not expensive to dine.
1,非常好，交通很方便，就在市区，娱乐也很方便。就是携程的价格不是很优惠。,"Very good, transportation is very convenient, just in the urban area, entertainment is also very convenient.That is, Ctrip's price is not very favorable."
1,"环境不错,交通也很方便,购物吃饭也方便,公司来天津出差都是入住这个酒店!","The environment is good, the transportation is also very convenient, and it is convenient to shop and eat. The company comes to Tianjin to stay in this hotel!"
1,不错.大床房免费升级到套间.设施不错,Yes. Big bed rooms are upgraded to the suite for free. The facilities are good
0,非常差，下次肯定不会入住了，强烈建议各位不要住这个酒店！说是五星级的标准建的，连三星的标准都未到！假五星，未挂牌！问前台，说游泳池改造，所以还不能参与评星。估计是不敢！我入住的是1505房。1、房间设施非常旧，桌椅掉了不少漆；2、洗手间镜子周围锈迹斑斑；3、洗手间的花洒在冲凉时竟然掉下来了；4、空调调到低温时的噪音吵的睡不着；5、前台竟然只有一个男服务员，说下班了，只有他一人值班，服务很一般；5、前台结帐竟然收一块的保险费（携程网上并未注明，服务员也未提前说明）....唯一过的去的是，礼宾部的态度还可以。硬件差，软件再好也没用。第二天一早就转到隔挂四星的波斯特（POST）了。要不是飞机晚点半夜才到，我们当晚就转了。建议携程在这个酒店的前面不要打五星！,"Very bad, I will definitely not stay next time. It is strongly recommended that you do not live in this hotel!It is said that it was built by five -star standards, and even Samsung's standards have not arrived!Fake five -star, not listed!Ask the front desk and say that the swimming pool is renovated, so you can't participate in the star evaluation.I guess you dare not!I stayed in room 1505.1. The room facilities are very old, and the tables and chairs have dropped a lot of paint.No; 5. There is only one male waiter in the front desk. It is said that he is on duty and the service is very average.... The only thing to go is that the attitude of the Ritin Department is okay.Poor hardware, no matter how good the software is, it is useless.The next morning, I moved to POST, which was separated by four -star.If it wasn't for the airplane late at midnight, we would turn that night.It is recommended that Ctrip do not play five stars in front of this hotel!"
0,我是查看了点评之后才选择入住天鹅酒店的，但结果却大失所望。我们的车到达酒店门口后，行李生盯着我们看，却不主动上来帮忙拿行李，我走过去问他，“酒店没有行李生吗？”行李生才恍然大悟说，有有有。一推开客房门，就一股恶臭扑鼻而来，令人作呕。房间很陈旧，隔音非常差，不知什么电机还是什么设备运转的声音轰鸣一阵停一阵，又不时有重物敲击的声音，反正吵得一夜无法入睡。第二天一早6点多赶紧起床退房。原来我们是交了2晚的订金打算住多一天的。因为工作关系经常出差，这家酒店是我十多年里住过的最差的酒店。简直难以想象，挂牌四星的酒店，硬件设施及服务都不如一般的招待所。,"I chose to stay at the Swan Hotel after checking the review, but the result was disappointed.After our car arrived at the entrance of the hotel, the luggage was staring at us, but did not take the initiative to help take the luggage. I walked over and asked him, ""Does the hotel have no luggage to have a life?"" The luggage gave birth to a lot.As soon as the door was opened, a stench came, which was disgusting.The room is very old and the sound insulation is very poor. I do n’t know if the sound of the motor or the operation of the device has a roar for a while, and there is a sound of heavy objects from time to time.Hurry up at 6 o'clock the next morning and get up and check out.It turned out that we had to pay 2 night deposits and planned to live a day.Because of the work relationship, this hotel is the worst hotel I have lived in more than ten years.It is hard to imagine that the list of four -star hotels, hardware facilities and services are not as good as ordinary guest houses."
1,之前就听说苏州万丽是苏州生意最好，房价最高，也是业内人士最推崇的酒店，远胜于喜来登，香格里拉，索菲特，在苏州属于一枝独秀型的，平时房间非常的难定，几乎天天满房，这次好不容易定了个行政套，本打算住一天，后又延了一天，简单来说吧，房间不大但很温馨，酒店工作人员不多但都非常专业，亲切，严格意义上来说该酒店硬件并不突出，没有游泳池，没有特色餐厅，建筑也没有什么特色，处处透露着简单，适用，大气，但是只有你住了以后才会觉得，值！。。。。。。。还记得苏州迷宫喜来登的恐怖经历，差点把我绕死。。。。。。。。。。。。。下次只要有房间，肯定住他。,"I heard that Suzhou Wanli is the best business and the highest house prices in Suzhou. It is also the most respected hotel in the industry. It is far better than in Sheraton, Shangri -La, Sophiet. It is a single -style in Suzhou. Usually, the room is very difficult.Every day, I finally set up an administrative set. I planned to live for a day, and then extended for another day. In short, the room is not large but very warm.In a sense, the hotel's hardware is not prominent. There are no swimming pools, no special restaurants, and no special features. It reveals simple, applicable, atmospheric, but only after you live, you will feel it!EssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceI still remember the horror experience of Xilaidon in Suzhou, almost wrapped me to death.EssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceAs long as there is a room next time, I will definitely live in him."
1,前几天刚在这里住了一晚，398的还不错，交通座公交很方便，呵呵~~要是含早餐就更好了，也不用出去吃，下次到北京还会去住的。,"I just lived here a few days ago. The 398 is pretty good. The transportation seat is very convenient. Hehe ~~ If it contains breakfast, it will be better. You do n’t have to go out to eat. I will live in Beijing next time."
1,还不错，服务员的响应速度有点慢。住的房间空调声音有点响，里面好像有异物，当啷当啷的。,"Not bad, the response speed of the waiter is a bit slow.The sound of air conditioning in the room was a bit loud, and there seemed to be a foreign body inside."
0,"该酒店很差,服务实在无法忍耐,属于老土级酒店,四星级价格,比附近的安阳宾馆和中原宾馆差远了.价格还贵,下次不会住.","The hotel is very poor, and the service is really unbearable. It belongs to the old -fashioned hotel, the price of four -star, which is far worse than the nearby Anyang Hotel and the Central Plains Hotel. The price is more expensive, and it will not live next time."
1,"这次去泉州有三个国外客人一起同行,还是入住了泉酒.大堂有水仙花装饰,有一股清香.环境很好.以390元的价格入住,超值.客人称赞酒店很不错,我想这是每个入住客人的同感.","This time, I went to Quanzhou three foreign guests to walk together. I still stayed in Quanjiu. There was a daffodil decoration in the lobby, and there was a fragrance. The environment was very good. Check in at a price of 390 yuan.It is the same feeling of every guest who stays in."
1,酒店房间很大，比较卫生，但作为三星级酒店价格偏高，比广州北京的三星级酒店的价格高,"The hotel room is very large and relatively hygienic, but as a three -star hotel, the price is high, which is higher than the price of a three -star hotel in Guangzhou Beijing."
1,四星的酒店环境不错，但我们入住的竹苑单间房间比较陈旧,"The four -star hotel environment is good, but the single room of the Zhuyuan in Zhuyuan we stayed in is relatively old"
0,很差劲的地方。是人都不要住。设施什么都不好还贵。真是晦气,Very bad place.Don't live.The facilities are not good and expensive.It's so obscure
1,老板每次出差到北京都要订这家酒店的，对它很满意哦,"Every time the boss travels to Beijing, you have to book this hotel. I am very satisfied with it"
1,比较普通的酒店，服务还行，设施也一般，楼下的自助餐非常好，菜品非常丰盛。房间就比较普通了。,"The more ordinary hotels, the service is okay, the facilities are also average, the buffet downstairs is very good, and the dishes are very rich.The room is relatively ordinary."
1,我这次住的超好，现在前面的几栋楼房间都是新装修的，超大的液晶电视机，可以用来上网，爽极了，物超所值，不过有涨价了，原来300，现在330了，不知道还会涨不？,"I live in super well this time. Now the few buildings in the previous buildings are newly renovated. The large LCD TV can be used for surfing the Internet.Now 330, I don’t know if it will rise?"
0,"服务态度实在是太差了,尤其是楼层的服务员,全是大婶,态度非常的恶劣!洗手间一洗澡全是水,洗脸盆的流水速度真的是慢的考验人的耐心.这个酒店整体而已比较差.服务和设施都不值那个价钱.晚上火车很吵.宾馆反馈2006年12月13日：非常感谢您对我们的直言批评，酒店方对您的意见非常重视，并专门就您所提出的意见召开了一次现场会议，并决定酒店即日起将开始进行一次全面的服务意识的全员培训。关于洗手间排水地漏的改造工作也同时展开，另外酒店的隔音改造工程也将同步完成。对于酒店给您的入住带来的不快，酒店表示再次的道歉。我们将进一步地加快产品完善，切实提高服务质量。希望您能再次光临我们酒店。","The service attitude is too bad, especially the waiter of the floor, all of which are aunt, the attitude is very bad!

1,还不错的酒店，虽然有些旧，日方也撤资了。可能南京本来也不大的原因吧，从酒店去新街口等地方都不远。服务也很好。,"The pretty hotel, although it is a bit old, the Japanese side withdraw money.Maybe there are not much reason for Nanjing. It is not far from the hotel to Xinjiekou and other places.The service is also very good."

1,现在去无锡经常入住这家酒店，环境不错，因为不是太湖风景区，所以自驾车的朋友比较合适。不过，送餐服务的品种似乎减少了，也不过只有两三个品种，建议酒店改进一下，酒吧的感觉不错，还可以打桌球，感觉比较的轻松宾馆反馈2008年7月30日：非常感谢阁下给我们酒店提出的宝贵意见，送餐问题已向酒店餐饮部经理反映了，如果您有好的送餐品种建议，下次也可直接与我们销售部联系，（分机8708）届时会有小礼物赠送哦！！期待您的下次光临！！！,"Now go to Wuxi to stay in this hotel, the environment is good, because it is not the Taihu Scenic Area, so friends who drive self -driving are more appropriate.However, the variety of food delivery services seems to be reduced, but there are only two or three varieties.

1,对面就是世帆赛基地，蓝天白天帆船，感觉非常棒。交通很方便。房间还不错，宽带速度很快，就是卫生间小了点。服务还有待加强，入住的时候居然还把我和其他预订的客人搞错。早餐还可以，就是要走到旁边的俱乐部用餐，不太方便。,"Opposite the World Sailing Base, the blue sky daytime sailing, it feels very good.Transportation is very convenient.The room is not good, and the broadband speed is fast, that is, the bathroom is a little smaller.The service needs to be strengthened, and when I check in, I still make mistakes with other reservations with other reservations.Breakfast is okay, it is not convenient to go to the next club to dine."
1,只可惜硬件设施不完备，加上路边的噪音，给本来应是很完美的酒店留下了一点遗憾，希望如家的加盟店更上一层楼。,"Unfortunately, the hardware facilities are incomplete, and the noise on the roadside will leave a little regret to the hotel that should have been perfect. I hope that the franchise stores of Rujiajia will go to the next level."
1,"地点不错,离开汽车站不太远,走路十五分钟,打的两分钟就可以.订房时送的早餐质量强差人意,但附近有麦当和肯德鸡.房间挺宽,干净,但电器的插头是圆孔,有点不方便.宽带的插头离开桌子一段距离,不太方便.大堂服务员态度可以接受,不太冷.泳池的水是绿色,不是蓝色,太差了,我不敢下水了.","The location is good, it is not too far away from the bus station, walk for fifteen minutes, you can play for two minutes. The quality of the breakfast delivered during booking is unsatisfactory, but there are McDonald and KFC. The room is quite wide and clean, but the electrical applianceThe plug is a round hole, which is a bit inconvenient. Broadband plugs leave the table for a while, which is not convenient. The lobby waiter's attitude is acceptable. It is not too cold.It's."
1,"绝对超值的酒店!离海边很近,走过场分钟就到码头,可以直接乘船去鼓浪屿.地理位置非常好,从酒店出去走10分钟就到注明的步行街.吃的用的都可以买到.我订的是行政房,可以免费饮用房间内小冰箱的饮料和啤酒,还可以随便去行政酒廊喝一杯.下午5点的下午茶时间有各种饮品和小吃,如寿司,香肠,烤鱼,烤肉等.非常好吃!早餐丰盛,既有西式又有","Absolutely value hotel! It is close to the seaside. After walking for a minute, you can go to the dock in minutes. You can take the boat directly to Gulangyu. The geographical location is very good. After 10 minutes of walking, you can go to the walking street.I ordered the administrative room, you can drink free drinks and beer in the small refrigerator in the room, and you can go to the administrative lounge for a drink. At 5 pm afternoon tea, there are various beverages and snacks, such as sushi, sausage, roasting, roastingFish, barbecue, etc. are very delicious! Breakfast is rich, both Western style and there are"
1,总的来说，不值。住过一次410无窗的房子，在11月的冬天居然热的我难受，叫来服务员，确认没有开暖风，问他们解决办法，居然说是让我加钱住有窗户的房子。我是住无窗的房子了，那也不代表我必须接受30度的室内高温吧？以后住那里的注意下，我怀疑在9－11层左右的无窗房子紧挨着供暖系统等热源，热的人难受。580的房子也住过，条件等还好了。但卫生间很差很差，会渗水会返臭味。,"Overall, it is worthless.I lived in a 410 window without window. In the winter of November, I was uncomfortable. I called the waiter and confirmed that there was no warm wind. Ask them to solve it, I actually said that I would add money to living in a house with windows.I have a house without a window, and it does not mean that I must accept a 30 -degree indoor temperature?After staying there in the future, I suspected that there were hot sources such as the heating system around the 9-11 floor, and the hot people were uncomfortable.The 580 house has also lived, and the conditions are okay.However, the bathroom is very poor, and it will penetrate and return the odor."
1,房间很旧，停车要收10元一晚，服务态度还可以,"The room is very old, the parking needs to be closed for 10 yuan a night, the service attitude is okay"
1,地理环境不错，但对面一直在盖楼，门前街道上打车不方便。,"The geographical environment is good, but the opposite side has been built, and it is inconvenient to take a taxi on the street in front of the door."
0,"竟然有如此差的酒店,楼下的居然说满意,还有哪有什么接机,送机免费,我真怀疑你是媒子.四星级酒店内竟然没有纸巾,卫生间小就算了,浴室四个角有三个角是补的,其中一个角长期没打扫干净,有恶心的黄迹.手巾粗糙,尤其浴衣可以说惨不忍睹.酒店是分时用空调,好不容易挨到了,风极小,叫维修人员,竟然连面也不照就说修不了,要不换房间好了.最奇怪的数电视机了,我朋友光脚从其前面走过去就有信号,等走回来信号就没了.还有惨的呢,就住这一晚害得我们俩人身上起了很我疹子,不知是被咬的,还是用具不干净过敏.原本住两晚的,只好拖着箱子赶紧逃离去了中心大酒店,真是英明的决定,总算最后没对烟台倒胃口.","There are such poor hotels, and the one downstairs is actually satisfied. There are any pick -ups and free of charge. I really doubt that you are a matchmaker. There are no paper towels in the four -star hotel. The bathroom is small.There are three horns to make up for a corner. One of the corners has not been cleaned for a long time. There are disgusting yellow traces. The hand towels are rough, especially the yukata can be said to be terrible. The hotel is used to use air conditioning.Personnel, even if you do n’t even look at it, you ca n’t repair it. If you do n’t change the room. The strange number of TV sets. My friend has a signal when you walk in front of him.There is a miserable one, and the night that the two of us were very rash, I do n’t know if it was bitten, or the utensils were not clean. For two nights, I had to drag the box and escape to the center of the center.Hotel, it is really wise decision. Finally, I did n’t have an appetite to Yantai."
1,房间蛮合心意，早餐也很丰富，附属设施一般。周围的环境比较差，不过还算有几个小吃店能对付一顿简餐。,"The room is quite interested, the breakfast is also very rich, and the auxiliary facilities are average.The surrounding environment is poor, but there are still a few snack bars to deal with a simple meal."
0,酒店设施很差，根本不像四星酒店。卫生间的镜子边上已破烂不堪，马桶也下不去水。酒店里吃晚饭时，只有3桌，但等菜半个多小时，服务员都搞不清菜该上哪一桌。唯一感到满意的是房间很大。,"The hotel facilities are poor, not like the four -star hotel at all.The mirror of the bathroom was tattered, and the toilet would not be removed.When eating dinner in the hotel, there are only 3 tables, but when the food is more than half an hour, the waiters can't figure out which table to get on.The only thing that is satisfied is that the room is large."
1,由于酒店距火车站近，所以出租车不愿去，但这是长沙出租车主管部门的问题，和酒店无关，后来火车站广场上一位交通协管员叫我们坐1路公交车，3站路就到了，只要1元钱，很方便又便宜。房间很干净，还免费送水果，下次有机会还住这个酒店。,"Since the hotel is close to the railway station, the taxi is unwilling to go, but this is a problem with the competent department of the Changsha taxi, which has nothing to do with the hotel. LaterThe road is here. As long as 1 yuan, it is very convenient and cheap.The room is very clean, and the fruit will be given free of charge. I have the opportunity to stay in this hotel next time."
0,"非常不好,房间的装修太旧,就像90年代的感觉.入住的168的所谓豪华标准间,只能说普通标准间罢了,老公睡觉起来","Very bad, the decoration of the room is too old, just like the feeling of the 1990s. The so -called luxury standard room of 168 in the stay in the 1990s can only be said to be a normal standard room. My husband sleeps."
0,很很的酒店星差不多！不知道3星怎么上去的？房首先光很暗，壁非常！上有水的痕，浴室非常非常小！！！竟然用一浴隔着有浴盆等等，毛巾非常破，我是有用得太了！！！房光重不足，服度不好，一直自己房很，可是也看人登的！房推三阻四！就是三星的。。,"Very very hotel star!I don't know how 3 stars went up?The room is very dark first, and the wall is very!There are water marks on the bathroom, the bathroom is very, very small!IntersectionIntersectionI actually used a bath with a bathtub and so on. The towels were very broken. I was too useful!IntersectionIntersectionThe room light is not enough, and the degree of service is not good. I have always been my own room, but I also depend on people!Three resistances for houses!It's Samsung.Essence"
0,老掉牙的五星酒店，我们入住的客房窗外就是酒店的封闭露台，窗下堆放疑似废弃的棉被等物品，还好就住一天，拉上窗帘将就一夜，第二天就赶紧离店了。,"The old -fashioned five -star hotel, the room window we stayed in was the closed terrace of the hotel. The suspected abandoned quilts and other items were stacked under the window. Fortunately, staying for one day, the curtains were pulled up one night, and the next day quickly left the shop."
1,"第三次入住,前两次是豪华房此次是标准间.豪华间超大,标间虽小也很舒适.前台服务,速度基本满意.早餐一般.最满意的是如团队同时入住,房卡后会自动列出每个成员的房号,非常方便.不足的是大厅经常有来餐厅吃饭","For the third time, the first two times were the luxury room this time.It will automatically list each member's room number, which is very convenient. The lack is that there are often restaurants to eat in the lobby"
0,房间设施与4星的标准差了很远的一个酒店个人认为房间的设施至多达到1颗星就足以匹配的一个酒店由于住的的是1层的原因吧房间里白天几乎都必须开灯而且弥漫了一股潮湿发霉的气味房屋隔音很差一早就被走道过往的客人嘲杂的声音吵得不能好好睡个懒觉,"A hotel with a standard difference between the room facilities and the 4 -star personally thinks that the room facilities are enough to match a hotel that is enough to match. Because the 1 -floor is living, the room must be turned on during the day and the room must be turned on and permeated during the day and permeated.A wet and moldy smell, the sound insulation of the house was very poor, and the guests who were trapped by the passengers of the aisle could not make a good sleep."
0,这简直就是一个破酒店，就是看了前面几个哥们的评价再听说它离茶店子客运站近。上了大当。首先，宾馆很老很旧，而且应该是以前的办公楼改的，想想吧。连地毯都没的。其次，不能刷卡最后，明目张胆的开假发票----直接在脱印纸上写。最过分的是，靠，你都这样开发票了，你还不盖章，害大爷带回来报销时才发现。当然，这一切都是我自己选择的，我活该。这里只是给大家提个醒。,"This is simply a hotel, that is, after watching the evaluation of the previous buddies, I heard that it is close to the tea shop passenger station.Dangdang.First of all, the hotel is very old and old, and it should be changed to the previous office building. Think about it.There is no carpet.Secondly, you ca n’t swipe the card at the end, and you can open a fake invoice with a bold eye ---- write it directly on the dushing paper.The most excessive thing is that you have invoiced this way. You do n’t stamp it, and you only discover it when the uncle brought it back to the reimbursement.Of course, I chose all this, I deserve it.Here I just wake up."
0,我定的是大床房，到酒店报了携程却给了我一间电梯边的房间，窗外也无任何景色之谈，客房小的就只放一张大床，还被告知就只有这间房，不满意也没有房间可以换，没想到通过携程订的房会是这样，反正下次是不会入住了。但房间的洗浴卫生方面还是满意的。,"I set a big bed room. I went to the hotel to report to the room but gave me a room beside the elevator. There was no scene outside the window. The room was small, and only one large bed was placed.There is no room to change without satisfaction. I did not expect that this would be like this through Ctrip. Anyway, I won't stay next time.But the room's bathing sanitation is still satisfactory."
1,酒店在鹅岭公园附近，重庆市园林局旁，酒店说是商务酒店，可装修却是度假酒店的风格。很多房间外面都有小阳台。房间很宽敞，就是淋浴房渗水太厉害，花洒龙头也在漏水；每天早上睡懒觉，会有人敲门问你有没有衣服洗；早餐很简单，没什么好吃的东西，橙汁是用水兑的，不过是在四楼咖啡厅，有露天用餐区，从四楼咖啡厅凭房卡还可以直接去鹅岭公园，不过有点多此一举，公园本来就是免费的。酒店门口有去市区的中巴，打的去两路口、上清寺等市中心区域，也只是五块钱的起步价，交通应该说还是方便的。离酒店不远、鹅岭公园门口有一家周火锅，价廉物美，非常不错。从机场去酒店的朋友，可以从机场坐机场班车到上清寺下，然后打车去酒店，起步价就可以到。补充点评2007年7月16日：补充一下，携程价格信息里说酒店送20元的电话费，不是每天送20元，是入住一次送20元。我们入住四天，也只有20块。,"The hotel is near the Yeling Park, next to the Chongqing Garden Bureau. The hotel said that it is a business hotel, but the decoration is the style of the resort hotel.There are small balconies outside many rooms.The room is very spacious, that is, the shower room is too severe, and the draft faucet is also leaking. Every morning, when you sleep lazily, someone will knock on the door and ask if you have clothes to wash; breakfast is simple, there is nothing delicious, orange juice is exchanged with water, butIt is in the cafe on the fourth floor. There is an open -air dining area. From the coffee shop on the fourth floor, you can go directly to the Yiling Park with the house card, but it is a bit more. The park is originally free.At the entrance of the hotel, there is Zhongba in the urban area. It is only a five -dollar starting price to go to the city center of the two roads, Shangqing Temple, etc., and the transportation should be convenient.Not far from the hotel, there is a weekly hot pot at the entrance of the Yiling Park, which is cheap and very good.Friends who go to the hotel from the airport can take the airport bus from the airport to the Shangqing Temple, and then take a taxi to the hotel.Supplementary comment on July 16, 2007: In addition, Ctrip's price information said that the hotel's telephone fee for 20 yuan is not 20 yuan per day, but 20 yuan at a time.We stayed for four days, and there were only 20 yuan."
1,晚上询问需不需要保健按摩的电话不停，如隔天一早赶飞机的人，最好拔掉电话线自保。,"In the evening, calling the phone that requires health massage is constantly. For example, people who drive the plane the next morning, it is best to remove the phone line to protect themselves."
0,真的差，这家酒店实在是服务有问题，说染头发掉色，弄脏了他的枕头，还问我要不要拿走（埋单），呵呵，住了那么多年酒店也是第一次，也不和他们说，你喜欢怎么扣就扣吧，以后不会再住如家，我第二天住了淄博饭店2天，也看到枕头有印，但是我告诉他们，他们说我们会帮您换上新的，这个我们会清洗了，实际上也住过如家几次，实际说真的，并不是非常理想，房间隔音差，管理参差不齐，酒店位置差，加上打的费用一样！就是靠服务员说几句你好就是管理？就是如家？以后真的不住如家！,"It's really bad. This hotel is really a problem with service. It is said that the hair dyed and droolled his pillow. I also asked me if I wanted to take it (buried). Hehe, it was the first time I have lived for so many years.Tell them, you can deduct how you like how to deduct it. In the future, I will not live in home. I lived in the Zibo Hotel for 2 days the next day. I also saw the pillows printed, but I told them that we would help you change it.New, we will clean this, in fact, we have lived a few times. In fact, it is not very ideal. The room sound insulation is poor, the management is uneven, the hotel location is poor, and the cost of the play is the same!Just by the waiter to say a few words, hello is management?Just like home?I really can't live like home!"
1,"这是呼和浩特唯一一家国际联锁酒店,位置离商业中心很近，听说生意非常好,我们订房时只有行政间了.行政楼层有免费的电脑可以上网,报纸杂志也都还算全.行政房间较大,但没什么风景,都是街道.早餐午餐都吃的自助,很一般,种类太少,中餐好象都没有羊肉的菜品，很奇怪，内蒙古不就是吃这些的好地方吗，而且我们要带汽的矿泉水，告没有，要可口可乐或者雪碧，也没有，好象只提供百事公司的产品．酒店有一个意大利餐厅，只有晚上开业．虽然厨师是一个中国人，但手艺还不错，味道不差，服务员的态度也很好．不足的地方就是开车不太容易，需要门童走到街上叫车．","This is the only international unlocking hotel in Hohhot, which is very close to the business center. I heard that the business is very good. When we book, we only have administrative rooms. There are free computers in the administrative floor.Larger, but there is no scenery, all of which are streets. Buffets for breakfast lunch are very average. There are too few types of Chinese food. It seems that there is no dish for lamb.The mineral water with vapor, no, Coca -Cola or Sprite, nor does it seem to provide only Pepsi's products.The hotel has a Italian restaurant, which only opens at night.Although the chef is a Chinese, the craftsmanship is not bad, the taste is not bad, and the waiter's attitude is very good.Insufficient places are not easy to drive. You need to go to the street to call a car."
1,一开始订的酒店式公寓，很不满意，虽然CHECKIN了，但携程的工作人员还是帮我跟酒店方协商免费退掉了，并跟换了这家。因为要求离新光天地近的。酒店大堂很漂亮，还有古老埃及的女神像，3个很大的！就大堂来说勘比5星，虽然入口在一个弄塘里。房间嘛，就是3星了，地板的。我住的那间卫生间在房间最里面，其中一张床都快顶着浴室门口了，人要斜着走出来，有一次脚趾头勾到床单，差点率一跤！淋浴，没有浴缸。不过值得表扬的是服务员态度非常的好，出了很多小问题，但是都很热情地帮我解决了！谢谢！,"At the beginning, the hotel -style apartment was very dissatisfied. Although CHECKIN was checin, Ctrip's staff still helped me with a negotiation with the hotel party to retreat and replaced the house.Because it is required to be close to Shin Kong Tiandi.The hotel lobby is very beautiful, as well as the goddess statue of ancient Egypt, three big one!As far as the lobby is concerned, although the entrance is in a pond.The room is 3 stars, floor.The bathroom I lived in the inside of the room.

There are many small problems, but they are very enthusiastic to help me solve it!Thanks!"
0,这是本人用携程预定的最糟糕的酒店，建议取消该酒店的合作。,"This is the worst hotel booked by Ctrip, and it is recommended to cancel the hotel's cooperation."
1,"没有想象的离西湖近,年轻人走走也得10-15分钟.因为窗不是面对西湖的,所以景基本看不到西湖,要把头探出去,勉强看到商业街远处的尽头是湖面","Those who are not imagined are close to West Lake, and young people have to walk for 10-15 minutes. Because the window is not faced with West Lake, the scene does not see West Lake. You have to push your head out."
0,购物较方便，上外滩也近，但房间太小。没有早餐不方便，较为嘈杂，装修较老,"Shopping is more convenient, and it is close to the Bund, but the room is too small.No breakfast is inconvenient, more noisy, and the decoration is older"
0,"房间设施远达不到四星水平,勉强也就是三星.","The room facilities are far from the level of four -star, which is barely, which is Samsung."
1,"来苏州好多次了，基本上都住在这家酒店。给我的感觉非常好，房间很干净，设施也很全，各种用品也很不错。而且前台的知道我的喜好，每次都安排的很好。入住过几次后每次都会有一些小礼品赠送，虽然价值不高，但是感觉非常温馨，上网网速也很快，比我上次在南京住的锦江之星要好太多了。下次来苏州这家酒店是首先。说了好的，再说不好的。就是Ctrip的商务客人基本上都被安排在东楼，房间里感觉有点暗，光线不是太好。但是很安静，不象主楼一样临街上。很适合我这种喜欢安静的人。宾馆反馈2008年8月8日：非常感谢您对我们服务的肯定,您的支持就是我们前进的动力.同时也非常感谢您对我们提出的意见,我们会对房间的灯光进行检查及维护.期待您的再次光临.","I have come to Suzhou many times and basically live in this hotel.It feels very good for me, the room is clean, the facilities are complete, and all kinds of supplies are very good.And the front desk knows my preferences, and every time I arrange well.After checking in several times, there will be some small gifts for each time. Although the value is not high, it feels very warm and the Internet speed is very fast. It is much better than the Jinjiang Star I lived in Nanjing last time.The next time I come to Suzhou is the first.Said, it's not good.That is, CTRIP's business guests are basically arranged in Donglou. The room feels a bit dark, and the light is not very good.But very quiet, not like the main building.It is very suitable for people like me who likes quiet.Hotel feedback on August 8, 2008: Thank you very much for your affirmation of our service. Your support is the motivation for our progress. At the same time, thank you very much for the opinions of us.Your visit again."
1,其实已经是多次入住了，基本上是每次去北京首选的地方，不知道是习惯了如家的感觉还是怎么样，总之现在的房间是越住越觉得宽。热水依然充足，热量/水量十足。习惯了北京城的巨大，其实出门左右两边都有好吃的地。最近马路左手斜对面又新开了一家24小时的拉面馆，凌晨睡不着又饿的时候再也无需找出租车满城乱钻了。,"In fact, it has been checked many times. Basically, it is the first place to go to Beijing. I do n’t know if it ’s used to it. In short, the more I live in the current room, the more I feel wider.The hot water is still sufficient, and the heat/water volume is full.It is used to the huge Beijing city. In fact, there are delicious land on the left and right sides.Recently, the left hand of the road has a new 24 -hour ramen restaurant. When I can't sleep and hungry in the morning, I no longer need to find a car rental."
1,不错的酒店，就是房间较小了一点，床较硬了点儿，其它都还不错,"The good hotel is that the room is smaller, the bed is harder, and the others are not bad."
1,已经是第二次入住了，服务还是一如既往的好，这家酒店也会给人带来很多的惊喜，我的笔记本出了点问题，我自己是解决不了，正着急的时候，想到了酒店，于是抱着试试的态度，询问了前台，令人很惊讶的是，酒店的工程部人员服务速度真快，效率也很高，几分钟后就解决了，帮了我一个大忙，真的很感谢他们。还有就是最近济南的天气不算好，我感冒了，老是咳嗽，所以买了点药放在了床头，今天早上出去的时候发现药没有了，本来想晚上回来的时候买点的，可是下午等我回来看到桌上的客房服务员留下的字条，以及床头上的咳嗽糖浆，当时我的鼻子酸酸的，出门在外最需要的就是关心，他们做到了。入住在这家酒店就和回到家一样，很温馨，心情很放松。,"It is already the second time to stay, and the service is as good as always. This hotel will also bring a lot of surprises. My notebook has some problems. I can't solve it myself. When I am in a hurry, I think of the hotel.So with the attitude of trying, I asked the front desk. It is surprising that the hotel's engineering department has a fast service speed and high efficiency. After a few minutes, it will be solved.Thank them.Also, the weather in Jinan recently is not good. I caught a cold and always cough, so I bought some medicine and put it on the bedside. When I went out this morning, I found that the medicine was gone. I wanted to buy something when I came back at night, butIn the afternoon, when I came back to see the note left by the guest room waiter on the table, and the cough syrup on the bedside, my nose was sour at the time. The most needed for going out is care. They did it.Staying at this hotel is the same as returning home. It is very warm and relaxed."
1,"有特色,有回味.我订了两个商务大床房,","It has characteristics and aftertaste. I ordered two large business bed rooms,"
0,通过携程预定后，到达酒店时，前台居然说没有预定成功，而且说该房型没有了，只有更高价位的房间，而且如果不马上确定也没了，打电话到携程沟通，10分钟后终于有了房间，刚才不是说没有了么！！！气死了，先不理他，后来和携程投诉，态度比较满意，答应再次入住给予免费升级到更高一级的房间，可是第二次去的时候竟然没有任何区别，原来该酒店只有这一种房间，只是便宜的房间数量少，诶，不过地理位置还算凑合吧，门口有几个停车位，就在三环边上，不过离中关村可就远了，想到中关村办事的我看见就算了，离北京电视台和北外，中国青年政治学院，北京理工大学，中央民族大学很近，去这些地方办事的，住在这里很方便。价格还算可以，最近搞活动吧，160一间，不过数量很少！房间硬件还说的过去，不过我住的时候，床上居然还有几根头发，算了，也不算什么大问题。总体感觉还凑合吧，性价比不错,"After the Ctrip's reservation, when the hotel arrived at the hotel, the front desk actually said that there was no reservation success, and the room type was gone, only a higher price room, and if it was not determined immediately, I called Ctrip to communicate. After 10 minutesIn the room, didn't you say it was gone?IntersectionIntersectionI was so angry that I ignored him first. Later, I complained to Ctrip, and my attitude was relatively satisfactory. I promised to move in again to give free upgrades to higher -level rooms, but there was no difference when I went for the second time.Planting a room is just a small number of cheap rooms, eh, but the geographical location is quite made. There are several parking spaces at the door, just on the third ring side, but it is far from Zhongguancun., To Beijing TV Station and Beiwai, the Chinese Academy of Political Sciences, Beijing University of Science and Technology, and the Central University for Nationalities are very close. It is convenient to live here and live here.The price is okay. Recently, you can engage in activities, 160, but the number is small!The hardware of the room also said, but when I lived, there were still a few hair on the bed. Forget it, it was not a big problem.Overall, it still feels good, the cost performance is good"
1,交通还酸方便。挺干净的。前台的服务态度也不错。,The traffic is sore.It's very clean.The service attitude of the front desk is also good.
0,环境较差，马路噪音非常大，而且房间之间的隔音处理得不好，睡在床上能听到楼道里的讲话声。房间偏小。另外，离机场非常远。出租司机走外环线，说是速度快，但走了40多公里。饭店周围的环境很乱。,"The environment is poor, the road is very noisy, and the sound insulation between the rooms is not handled well. Sleeping on the bed can hear the speech in the corridor.The room is small.In addition, it is very far from the airport.The rental driver walked the outer ring line and said it was fast, but he walked more than 40 kilometers.The environment around the hotel is messy."
1,非常好的位置，便于交通，面对星湖。地毯很厚实，感觉不错。,"Very good position, convenient for transportation, facing Xinghu.The carpet is thick and feels good."
1,一个字――满意，在烟台住过几家酒店，这里的服务最好提前联系酒店希望他们能到机场接我，总台小姐一口答应，我晚上8点多到烟台，车已经等着我了。到了酒店，问司机接机费多少钱时，竟然告诉我是免费的！！！他们有免费机场接送服务，第一次听说这种服务，不错，好像打车要40多块呀注意到酒店设有机场售票处，3分钟搞定机票，方便！总之，很好的酒店！肯定会常住,"One word -satisfied, I have lived in a few hotels in Yantai. The service here is best to contact the hotel in advance and hope that they can pick me up at the airport.EssenceWhen I arrived at the hotel, when I asked the driver how much money was the cost, I told me it was free!IntersectionIntersectionThey have a free airport pick -up service. The first time I heard this service, it is good. It seems that it takes more than 40 yuan to take a taxi. Note that the hotel has an airport ticket office for 3 minutes. It is convenient!In short, a good hotel!Will definitely live"
0,酒店根本没有装修，屋子里一股霉味。收费的宽带，有的房间还没有。餐厅一他弧度。没有任何值得推荐的地方。强烈建议大家以后不要住这里。,"The hotel was not decorated at all, and the smell of mold in the room.There are no rooms for broadband.The restaurant was arc.There is no recommendation.It is strongly recommended that you do not live here in the future."
0,还是房价贵了点，如果房价在200就可以了。,"It is still a bit expensive, if the house price is 200."
0,在临安还算是个不错的酒店，但是现在越来越差了。房间地毯非常脏；窗户隔音非常差，外面就是马路，只要有车就很吵；卫生间挂毛巾的地方都没有，除非台板下面；没有免费的饮用水；总台的服务很差，好像是你欠她的。不过也有好的方面：最近一次入住长话免费打，虽然我几乎不打；早餐不贵，而且很多健康食品。,"It is a good hotel in Lin'an, but now it is getting worse.The carpet in the room is very dirty; the windows of the windows are very poor, and the road is the road. As long as there is a car, it is very noisy; there is no place to hang towels in the bathroom, unless it is under the table; there is no free drinking water;I owe her.However, there are good aspects: the last time I stayed in long words for free, although I almost did not play; breakfast is not expensive, and many healthy foods."
1,总体不错!!!!,Overall !!!!
1,雄飞假日酒店位置挺好，离看灯会的彩灯公园挺近的，从房间窗户看出去是一条河（江），满舒服的。房间设施还可以，比较满意。离四星级的标准感觉还有一点点差距，不过房价还是可以。前台的价是￥368，携程￥258，还不错。,"The location of the Xiongfei Holiday is very good. The colorful lantern park is very close to the lantern festival. From the window of the room, it is a river (river), which is full of comfort.The room facilities are okay, and they are more satisfied.There is still a little gap between the four -star standard, but housing prices are still available.The price of the front desk is ￥ 368, Ctrip ￥ 258, pretty good."
1,整个酒店的环境、设施等都很不错，但让服务员拿份地图，却一直没拿来，价格好象比以前也高了一点。不过性价比还是令人满意的。,"The environment and facilities of the entire hotel are very good, but let the waiters get the map, but they have not been brought, and the price seems to be a little higher than before.But the cost -effective is still satisfactory."
1,"经常来沪出差,目的地在开发区内,所以选择了海悦.地处开发区,所以感觉偏僻点.不过打车还是方便的.也很安静.这很重要.酒店外观实在是非常之普通.不过门童态度很好.进入大厅.干净整洁.BOOKING时间也很短,前台MM服务态度很好,心里感觉还不错.然后到我的楼层.装潢让人舒服,路上碰到酒店服务人员,他们会问好.感觉软件服务不错.进入房间.硕大的双人床实在让人印象深刻.卫浴系统也很不错.硬件也相当的好.房间没有异味.总体感觉十分好.以后如果来上海.必定住这家了.的确是3星外表四星硬件五星服务.补充点评2008年3月3日：忘记说,身份证临走的时候遗留在酒店,前台小姐通过携程提醒我.感觉很满意.每次出门门童服务也很好.之后要找取款机.也热情帮忙.实在是很不错啊.","I often come to Shanghai to go out, and the destination is in the development zone, so I chose Haiyue. It is located in the development zone, so it feels remote. However, it is convenient to take a taxi. It is also very quiet. This is very important. The appearance of the hotel is really ordinary.However, the attitude of the door children is very good. Entering the lobby. Clean and tidy. Booking Time is also very short. The front desk MM service attitude is very good. I feel good in my heart. Then I go to my floor. The decoration is comfortable.I will ask well. I feel that the software service is good. Entering the room. The huge double bed is really impressive. The bathroom system is also very good. The hardware is also quite good. The room has no odor. The overall feeling is very good.Home. It is indeed a 3 -star outer four -star hardware and five -star service. Supplementary comment on March 3, 2008: Forgot to say that when the ID card is leaving, it is left in the hotel. The front desk lady reminds me through Ctrip.Mennong service is also very good. After that, I have to find a withdrawal machine. I also want to help. It is really good. It is really good."
0,环境很脏，不干净，床单好象很久没换过，破旧不堪宾馆反馈2008年6月29日：谢谢您提的宝贵意见，我们设施设备现已全面更换，欢迎您的下次入住！,"The environment is very dirty, not clean, the sheets seem to have not been changed for a long time, and the dilapidated hotel will feedback June 29, 2008: Thank you for your precious opinions. Our facilities and equipment have been replaced. Welcome to stay next time!"
1,去柳州出差不错的选择，尤其是商务房，朝北面的房间夜景不错。宾馆反馈2008年7月31日：非常感谢您对我酒店长期以来的大力支持和关心，我们朝南面的江景客房也很不错哦。此外我酒店按五星级标准装修的24-26楼高层观景客房即将竣工，期待您的光临！！,"Going to Liuzhou's good choices, especially business houses, the night view of the room north is good.Hotel feedback on July 31, 2008: Thank you very much for your long -term strong support and concern for our hotel. The Jiangjing guest room facing south is also very good.In addition, our hotel's high-rise viewing rooms decorated with five-star standard decoration will be completed soon. Looking forward to your visit!Intersection"
0,本人通过携程预订8月13日入住并确认接机，晚上9点45分到机场后一个小时没人接机。联系携程工作人员时他们还说酒店已派人来接只是搞错了我的手机号码，笑话哪家酒店接机是不用举牌而是用手机联系的？而且之前几次入住该酒店都是举牌接机的，工作失误不可怕只是携程和酒店的人员一起来欺骗客户把客户当傻瓜实在是缺乏最基本的职业道德。,"I reserved to stay in August 13 through Ctrip and confirmed the pick -up. I did not pick up the plane an hour after I arrived at the airport at 9:45 pm.When contacting the staff of Ctrip, they also said that the hotel had sent someone to pick up my phone number. Which hotel is a joke, which hotel does not need to get a card but use the mobile phone to contact it?Moreover, the hotel was held on the hotel several times before. The work errors were not terrible. It was just a lack of the most basic professional ethics to deceive customers to deceive customers as fools."
1,应该算是比较老的酒店了，但是整体的感觉不错，在三星的酒店中应该算是比较好的了，我住的是商务大床房，房间感觉还是挺宽敞的，早餐算是一般，不过前台的服务小姐确实很热心，感觉真的不错！！！顺便提一下，就是感觉房间的空调制冷效果好像不是很好，希望能改进一下！,"It should be considered a relatively old -fashioned hotel, but the overall feeling is good. It should be better in Samsung's hotel. I live in a large business bed room.Miss is really enthusiastic and feels really good!IntersectionIntersectionBy the way, it seems that the air -conditioning refrigeration effect of the room does not seem to be very good, I hope to improve it!"
1,确实和前面住过的人评价一致，服务态度很好，是我住过3星酒店里面最好的3星酒店，唯一感到一点不足的是空调不热。,"Indeed, it is consistent with the person who has lived in front. The service attitude is very good. It is the best 3 -star hotel in the 3 -star hotel. The only thing that feels that the air conditioner is not hot."
0,简单的说，当时是因为看到这个酒店07年新装修的，所以才选择他。不过，我想这辈子再也不会选这个酒店了，包括这个品牌。,"Simply put, he chose him because he saw the hotel's new decoration in 2007.However, I think I will never choose this hotel in this life, including this brand."
1,"我是看了网上的评论才定的该酒店,总结优点一是交通便利,二还是交通便利;别的确实差点!环境不说,要求本来不高,可入住三楼后发现外面是通风管道,嗡嗡一夜!劝入住的同志千万别选三层住!设施也相对老化,属于五星中的老年,需要重新装修!房间基本不通风和采光!住着比较憋屈!总之,我加了好多银子,住着不爽!后悔中......(今天刚从香港回来..)","I read the hotel on the Internet that the hotel was set. The advantages of the summary one was convenient transportation, and the second was convenient for transportation; the other is almost almost! The environment does not say, the request is not high.Tomped all night! Persuasion of comrades who stayed in the third layer do not choose three -layer residence! The facilities are relatively aging, which belongs to the elderly in the five -star, and you need to renovate again! The room is basically not ventilated and light! In short, I add a lot ofSilver, I am unhappy! I regret ... (I just returned from Hong Kong today ...)"
1,环境确实不错，很安静，我很喜欢。特别是木屋，户外阳台留有插线板，坐在阳台上上网很惬意的。这是我第二次在这里居住了。就是无线网络信号太弱，经常短线。没办法最后只要能用GPRS上网。非周末时间居住，感觉整个风景区被我一家人包了似的。,"The environment is really good, very quiet, I like it very much.Especially the wooden house, there is a plug -in board on the outdoor balcony, which is very pleasant to sit on the balcony.This is the second time I have lived here.That is, the wireless network signal is too weak and often short -term.There is no way to use GPRS to access the Internet in the end.Living in non -weekend, I feel that the entire scenic area is wrapped in my family."
1,"全家去千岛湖旅行,住了3家洒店,千岛湖,杭州,湖州各住一晚,同是三星,假日的硬件设施最逊,我们住的3号楼二层,底楼地毯的本色已经看不大出了,但毕竟在景区,要求不能太高,有两点是相当满意,一是因为饭店建在山腰,空气相当清新,环境相当安静,美美地睡了一觉;二是因为是散客,要赶8点的班船,时间太","The whole family went to Qiandao Lake, and lived in 3 sprinkles shops, Qiandao Lake, Hangzhou, and Huzhou for one night. It is also Samsung. The hardware facilities on the holiday are the most inferior.It is not big, but after all, in the scenic area, the requirements should not be too high. There are two points that are quite satisfied. One is because the hotel is built on the mountainside. The air is quite fresh and the environment is quite quiet. The second is because it is because it is because it is because it is because it isSaton, to catch 8 o'clock boards, time is too much"
1,酒店周围环境好很好，是个度假的好去处。打车直接让前台叫就可以，还比较方便。房间比较干净，面积也挺大，比一般标准间要大一点有个单独办公桌，很方便。,"The environment around the hotel is very good, it is a good place for vacation.Taxi can just let the front desk call, it is more convenient.The room is relatively clean and the area is quite large. It is a bit larger than the general standard room, which is very convenient."
1,"总体还不错.现在还配了杂志,可以学英文.酒店大堂在装修,以后正门将朝马路.","The overall is not bad. I still have a magazine now to learn English. The hotel lobby is renovating. After that, the main goal is facing the road."
1,6月8日遗忘在3226房间的iPod和挂绳耳机已经收到，谢谢白云山庄！此次白云山庄的中餐厅美食、酒店的管理服务给我们留下了很好的印象，赞一个！,"Forgotten on June 8th, IPOD and latter headphones in Room 3226 have been received. Thank you Baiyun Villa!The management service of the Chinese restaurant in Baiyun Mountain Villa has left a good impression on us, praised one!"
1,房间蛮干净，地理位置很好，早餐还不错。就是价格贵了,"The room is quite clean, the geographical location is good, and the breakfast is not bad.It's expensive"
1,11号带儿子、老爸、妹妹及外甥到千岛湖一游，11号下午入住天清岛酒店，酒店位置不太好找，卫星导航仪上也显示不出，打电话给酒店才知道大致方位。不过路上倒没有看到有些网友说的殡仪馆。酒店环境不错，有水墨画的感觉，房间设施也和后来我们住的开元差不多（就是卫生间是开元大多了).说说缺点：1、拿行李不方便，车子开不到大堂，不过和总台提出后行李员帮我们拿上去了，弥补了这点不足。2、作为一家按五星级建造的酒店居然没有水果赠送，和客房服务说了以后，居然回答我房费要达到一定级别才能送，晕倒，四星级以上就该有的服务，到了她这里变成了看人下菜。3、酒店入口许多房子空着，加上阳台上用的是地板，年份久了看上去旧旧的，而且是露天阳台，反正给人陈旧、冷清的感觉.4游泳池水不清，晚上去游还没看出来，第二天一看，根本看不到泳池底（不像开元是清澈见底的）。5、早点根本就不是五星标准，和三星差不多。晚上到镇里吃了晚饭回来开错了路绕了一大圈，居然看到一处卖骨灰盒的，吓得不轻。看来网友说的殡仪馆是真的，只不过在另一条路上。第二天马上退房换到开元，感觉天清岛比开元差了很多，开元给人的感觉很温馨，很安全，服务也不错，像有些网友说的，连搞卫生的阿姨也会和你打招呼。就是不知道为什么携程上说没房了，打电话去却说有，后来经提醒在开元集团网站上定的房，价钱和携程一样。补充点评2008年8月15日：下次去应该不会再住这家,"On the 11th, the son, dad, sister and nephew went to Qiandao Lake to visit the Tianqing Island Hotel on the afternoon of the 11th. The hotel location was not easy to find, and the satellite navigator could not be displayed.EssenceHowever, some netizens said on the road.The hotel environment is good, there is a feeling of ink painting, and the room facilities are almost the same as the Kaiyuan we lived later (that is, the bathroom is mostly Kaiyuan). Talking about the disadvantages: 1. It is not convenient to take the luggage, the car cannot be drove to the lobby, but it is proposed with the main station.Later, the luggage helped us to take it up and make up for this shortcoming.2. As a hotel built by a five -star, there is no gift from fruit. After talking to the guest room service, I actually answered that my room fee must reach a certain level before they can be delivered.This has become a look at people.3. Many houses at the entrance of the hotel are empty, and the floor is used on the balcony. It looks old for a long time, and it is an open -air balcony. Anyway, it feels old and deserted. 4 The swimming pool is unclear.I haven't seen it yet. When I saw it the next day, I couldn't see the bottom of the pool (unlike Kaiyuan is clear).5. Earlier is not the five -star standard at all, similar to Samsung.At night I went to the town for dinner and came back and opened the wrong circle. I actually saw a ashes selling ashes, which was so scared.It seems that the funeral home that netizens said are true, but on the other way.The next day, check out immediately to Kaiyuan. It feels that Tianqing Island is much worse than Kaiyuan. Kaiyuan feels very warm, safe, and good service. As some netizens say, even a hygienic aunt will also have you with yougreet.I do n’t know why Ctrip said that there is no house, but I called to say yes. Later, the price of the house on the website of Kaiyuan Group was reminded that the price was the same as Ctrip.Supplementary comment on August 15, 2008: Next time, you should not live again"
1,房间装修虽然旧点，但是格调还行。服务员不错，我那天忘记把衣服带走，过了好几天还能找到。,"Although the room decoration is old, the style is okay.The waiter is good. I forgot to take away my clothes that day and I could find it after several days."
1,还可以吧，价格实惠宾馆反馈2008年4月17日：谢谢！欢迎再次入住其士大酒店。,"Okay, the price of affordable hotel feedback on April 17, 2008: Thank you!Welcome to stay at the Big Hotel again."
0,"有上网但是是无线,停车在隔壁地下停车场,具说没有转人看管,结果提心吊胆一晚上",There is an Internet but wireless. The parking is in the underground parking lot next door.
0,"早餐很差劲,不过一般这种地方的四星也差不多就这样了.","Breakfast is bad, but in general, the four stars in this place are almost the same."
0,本人于清明假期一家三口高高兴兴通过携程订房入住，本想来个豪华的自驾游，哪知给我的房间小得可怜，对比我住过的国内外四星级以上酒店的环境，环境算得上是“恶劣”！在前台办理入住手续时，工作人员告诉我1.2米以下小孩早餐免费，于是补上一个成年人的早餐，第二天用早餐时，餐厅经理却跟我说小孩需付半价，而且是算对外收费全价！最后经过一番交涉，酒店大堂经理给折了个8折价，但已经让我们一家游趣全无！酒店的房间环境根本不值四星水平！装修旧，房间小，但酒店的地理位置好，所以就能如此定高价么？不解！补充点评2008年4月23日：对了，还有上网居然是收费的，这还是在国内第一碰到！不可思议！,"In the Qingming holiday, a family of three was happy and happy to book through Ctrip. I wanted to have a luxurious self -driving tour.It's ""bad""!When checking the procedures at the front desk, the staff told me that the breakfast for children less than 1.2 meters below 1.2 meters, so I made up for the breakfast of an adult. During the breakfast the next day, the restaurant manager told me that the child needs to pay half the price, and it is considered a foreign fee.Full price!Finally, after some negotiations, the hotel lobby manager gave a discount of 20 % off, but it has made our family have no fun!The hotel's room environment is not worth the level of four -star!The decoration is old, the room is small, but the hotel's geographical location is good, so can it be so high?Puzzle!Supplementary comment on April 23, 2008: By the way, there is a charge for surfing the Internet. This is the first in China!Incredible!"
1,酒店位置没说的，很好!就是大堂稍微小气了点，还有房间的设施也老旧了一点，比起刚开业时的那种感觉逊色了很多，不过还是挺喜欢这家酒店!,"The hotel's location is not said, it is good! It is a little bit of the lobby, and the facilities in the room are a bit older. Compared with the feeling of just opening, it is much inferior, but I still like this hotel!"
1,还不错，就是大门有点小。,"Not bad, but the door is a bit small."
1,酒店的环境在安庆还算不错，不过有点老，早餐很好！,"The environment of the hotel is pretty good in Anqing, but a bit old, breakfast is very good!"
1,房间真爽，传说的2104，一个人住还是真大。除了这个好像没有其他的优点了，早上赶火车到的想洗澡，空调没有，水还是有时无，最奇怪的是淋浴竟然是要把那个小开关往下按而不是拉，这是我发现的新大陆，害我还无知的问前台，打扫卫生时用吸尘器竟然跳闸，早餐真不叫早餐，什么都没有，20块太不值了。电梯爆慢，顶楼21楼等个电梯要抽几支烟的。不过服务员还是不错的。不过诸多不快被美丽的景色和服务员的笑脸给抹杀了！,"The room is so cool, the legendary 2104, a person lives alone.Except for this, there seems to be no other advantages. I want to take a bath in the morning when I rush to the train. There is no air conditioner.Ask me to ask the front desk ignorant. When cleaning, I used a vacuum cleaner to slice. Breakfast is really not called breakfast. Nothing is not worth 20.The elevator burst slowly, and a few cigarettes waited for an elevator on the top floor of the top floor.But the waiter is still good.But many unhappy scenes were wiped out by the beautiful scenery and the smiley of the waiter!"
1,酒店房间挺大，设施还可以，靠市中心很近。但是checkin速度挺慢的，要改进,"The hotel room is quite large, the facilities are okay, and the city center is very close.But checkin is very slow, so to improve"
0,第二次住的时候，酒店说我在房间里消费！很冤枉。。。,"When I stayed for the second time, the hotel said that I spent in the room!Very wrong.EssenceEssence"
1,同志们.我三四个月住了这酒店至少十一二次.不图什么.就是安静点.上次他们大堂经理跟我说住十次就什么常住客人.优惠等等...结果..结果..我上次去特地问过前台这次十一次还是十二次了有什么好处.前台说有水果会送上.汗.以前也有的.我也没多问.结果竟然连个水果也没了.其实我也不在乎这点小恩小惠的.但这次去订.竟然要杀我的猪猪...涨价了.这就是对待常往客人的:(哼太坏了.见利忘义的家伙.,"Comrades. I have lived in this hotel for at least eleven or two times in three or four months. I do n’t try anything. It ’s a quiet point. Last time their lobby manager told me what permanent guests would live ten times.. Result .. I went to specifically ask the front desk for the last eleven or twelve times. What are the benefits of the front desk? The front desk said that there are fruits that will be delivered. I didn’t ask it before.The fruit is gone. In fact, I don't care about this Xiao En Xiaohui. But this time I booked it. I wanted to kill my pigs ... the price increased. This is the treatment of the people who often go to the guests: (Hum is too bad. See Lyli.Forgotten guy."
1,天很，就提供空！很不！其他都不！,"God is very good, it will provide empty!Very no!Nothing else!"
0,非常糟糕的一个酒店，我是看了网上评论才会考虑入住这个酒店的。结果所有的都言过其实。我住的是788的豪华单人间，入住之后，发现酒店房间非常不好，房间很小，而且毛巾，床单都显得很脏。有种不干净的感觉，晚上觉得有点冷，想跟酒店多要张被子。结果被告知如果多加被子要加钱。心理很不爽。于是决定第二天要checkout.早上checkout的时候，告知说我把床单弄脏了（晚上睡觉有蚊子，抓痒的时候可能弄破了有点血迹在床单上，我还没跟你酒店索赔呢）。于是跟前台理论，然后把床单给我弄下来前台对质了。可能前台也觉得那些血迹不算什么，管我要钱说不过去，这事也就过去了。要是坚持要我给钱的话，我回跟前台吵得，实在不行，我会考虑报警。然后把帐单给我，发现多收了5块，问怎么回事，说是城市建设费。我不管有没有这个费用，但是一直在携城上订酒店就是多少钱就多少钱。有什么城市建设费，你要是收，可以。麻烦在和携城签约的时候把这个费用打到房费里面去。什么玩意。5块钱不算什么，但是让我感觉很不舒服。于是让他酒店拿出相关的规定给我看。结果所谓的大堂经理进去以后就再也没有出来了。还好有个上海朋友用上海话跟他们理论。不知道说什么，总之后来也没敢管我要这个钱了，后来朋友告诉我，前台说日本人很喜欢住这个酒店。对不起，我不是日本人，日本人喜欢，那是别人的事，跟我没有关系，你要是喜欢日本人，麻烦你说明白，不接待中国人好了。后来结账离开，有种逃出黑店的感觉。不知道携城会不会管这个事情。但是，如果以后再有发生这种事情的话，会影响我对携城的印象。总而言之，很烂的酒店。现在是淡季也敢要这个价格，真是穷疯了。可能这个酒店主要针对包月客户，其他散客逮住一个黑一个，建议大家不要去这个烂酒店。,"A very bad hotel, I will consider staying at this hotel after watching online comments.As a result, everything was over.I live in a luxury single room of 788. After checking in, I found that the hotel room was very bad, the room was small, and the towels and sheets looked dirty.There is a feeling of uncleanness. I feel a little cold at night and want to have more quilts with the hotel.As a result, it was told that if there were more quilts to add money.Psychologically uncomfortable.So I decided to checkout the next day. When checkout in the morning, I told that I had to get the sheets soaked (I had mosquitoes in the evening, and I might break a little blood on the sheets when I scratching it. I haven't claimed it with your hotel)EssenceSo follow the theory of the front desk, and then gave me the sheets and got the front desk for quality.Maybe the front desk also feels that those blood stains are not much. Regardless of the money I want to say, this matter has passed.If you insist on asking me to give money, I will quarrel with the front desk.Then I gave me the bill and found that I received 5 more. I asked what was going on, saying it was urban construction fees.No matter if I have this cost, I have been with the city to book a hotel.What city construction fee, if you charge it, can.Trouble this fee when signing a contract with the city.What the hell.5 yuan is nothing, but it makes me feel uncomfortable.So let the hotel take out relevant regulations.As a result, the so -called lobby manager never came out after entering.Fortunately, a Shanghai friend used Shanghai dialect to follow them theory.I do n’t know what to say, and I did n’t dare to manage me for this money. Later, my friend told me that the front platform said that the Japanese like to live in this hotel.Sorry, I am not a Japanese, and Japanese like it. It is a matter of others. It has nothing to do with me. If you like the Japanese, please explain it, you will not receive the Chinese.Later, he left at the checkout and felt like escaping out of the black shop.I don't know if the city will care about it.However, if this happens in the future, it will affect my impression of the city.All in all, very bad hotels.Now it is the off -season and dare to ask for this price, it is really crazy.Maybe this hotel is mainly aimed at the monthly customers. Other scattered customers caught one black. I suggest you not go to this bad hotel."
1,住的豪华标间，房间不大，设施还可以，液晶电视，同时做为电脑显示器，不过设计有问题，使用不太方便，无线键盘不太好用。总体还行，没有住过其他酒店，性价比无法评论。早饭一般，旋转餐厅，选择比较少。,"The luxury room where you live, the room is not large, the facilities are okay, the LCD TV, as a computer display at the same time, but the design is problematic, it is not convenient to use, and the wireless keyboard is not easy to use.Overall, no other hotels have been stayed, and the price / performance ratio cannot be commented.Breakfast, rotating restaurants, less choices."
0,明明在携程上用信用卡担保定了房，入住时居然前台说没有此信息，而且房间已经住满了，打电话到携程投诉，说是酒店预订部与前台没沟通好，折腾了半天，非常气人!,"Obviously, I used a credit card to guarantee the house on the Ctrip. When I was in check -in, I said that there was no information at the front desk, and the room was full. I called Ctrip complaints, saying that the hotel booking department did not communicate well with the front desk.people!"
1,因为看到各位携程网友的留言评价很高，就顶了。入住之后，果然名不虚传，服务非常好，酒店的设施也还不错，酒店的地理位置在市中心，去哪里都很方便。餐饮做的也很好。下次一定会选择。,"Because I saw that the comments of Ctrip netizens were highly evaluated, they were on the top.After check -in, it really has a good name, the service is very good, and the hotel's facilities are also good. The geographical location of the hotel is in the center of the city. It is convenient to go everywhere.The dining is also very good.I will choose next time."
1,交通挺方便的，离机场步行十分钟，离火车站车行十分钟。可能最近是淡季吧，有点冷清。,"The transportation is very convenient, walking for ten minutes away from the airport and ten minutes from the train station.Maybe it is the off -season recently, a bit deserted."
0,洒店总体规模较小。入住时，房内卫生没做！解释服务员少，来不及，我是晚七点入住的！入住后没注意，到晚十点多才发现没网络，与总台联系不能解决，态度不好，还要客人事先声明要有网络的房间！不给调房。与携程联系后给调了一间有网络的。房间较小，卫生间下水道装修有问题，有回味！补充点评2007年12月14日：网带特慢，一晚上打开不几个网页，网络形同虚设，办不了事。,"The overall scale of Saodian is small.During the check -in, the hygiene in the room did not do it!If there are fewer waiters, I stay at seven o'clock in the evening!I did n’t pay attention after check -in. I found that there was no network at ten o'clock in the evening. I could n’t contact the main station at ten o'clock. I could n’t solve it with the main station. The attitude was not good. It was also necessary to declare that there were rooms with a network in advance!Don't give a house.After contacting Ctrip, a network was adjusted.The room is small, there are problems with the decoration of the sewers of the bathroom, and have aftertaste!Supplementary comment on December 14, 2007: The net belt is very slow. There are not a few web pages on the night."
0,这是我有生以来住过的最差的4星级酒店--真的绝对不夸张！我订的是个套房，可进到房间，一看，居然是60年代的装修，完全和图片上的不一样--这也太有欺骗性了吧！就这样的房间还要448（不含早餐），太不值得了。卫生间旧就不说了，还脏脏的感觉，浴缸都有种让我下不去脚的感觉，整个房间都有股霉味。问了前台，说其他楼层都装修过就套房这层没装修--那怎么还要较高的价格呢？！真不能理解携程怎么会给出那样的介绍那样的图片和那样的价格！,"This is the worst 4-star hotel I have lived in my lifetime-it is absolutely not exaggerated!I booked a suite, which can enter the room. At first glance, it is actually decoration in the 1960s. It is completely different from the picture-this is too deceptive!There are 448 (excluding breakfast) such a room, which is not worth it.I do n’t say the old toilet, but I still feel dirty. The bathtub has a feeling that I do n’t go down, and the whole room has a chronological smell.I asked the front desk and said that the other floors had been decorated with the suites of the suite-why do you need a higher price?IntersectionI can't understand how Ctrip will give such an introduction like that picture and that price!"
1,看到众网友的评论，带着忐忑的心情入住了此酒店，入住后，我想客观的为它平反一下，让好的东西大家一起分享：）嘉峪关是个很小的城市，这家酒店大概是这个城市最好的酒店了。最令我满意的酒店的免费接机服务，毕竟来到一个相对陌生的环境，能有人接待让人有一种安全感。酒店的门童和服务员都很热情，嘉峪关相对于广东真的很冷，不过酒店很暖和。房间比较舒适，而且很干净，嘉峪关天气比较干燥，房间竟然配了加湿器，这一点比较人性化，充分考虑到了我们这些南方生活的人。关于早餐，我觉得很好呀，品种比较多，楼上的说开到九点，可我那天去的九点多了，还有的吃哦。看到楼上的数落，我禁不住为它说几句，嘿嘿或许服务仍然有提高的空间，但勿庸置疑，这样的城市是没办法和北京上海这样的大城市比的，我想他们朴实的热情已经填补了他们硬件上些许的缺憾，毕竟西北大家都很清楚。如果再来这里我会选择在这里住，也会介绍我的朋友在这里，^_^，客观不客观，还是自己试试才知道的，这是我的经验^_^，如果去嘉峪关，记得吃羊肉串，挺不错的，还便宜，去城楼看看，蛮有意思，这是提外话了^_^,"Seeing the comments of all netizens, I stayed in this hotel with a sorrowful mood. After check -in, I would like to objectively rehabilitate it and let everyone share it together :) Jiayuguan is a small city. This hotel is probably probably the hotel is probably.The best hotel in this city.The free pick -up service of the hotel that is most satisfactory, after all, when I come to a relatively strange environment, someone can receive a sense of security.The hotel's door children and waiters are very enthusiastic. Jiayuguan is really cold than Guangdong, but the hotel is very warm.The room is relatively comfortable and clean. The weather in Jiayuguan is relatively dry. The room is equipped with a humidifier. This is more user -friendly. It is fully considered that we live in the south.Regarding breakfast, I think it is good. There are many varieties. The upstairs said that it was nine o'clock, but I went at nine o'clock that day, and I also eat it.Seeing the number of upstairs, I can't help saying a few words for it. Hey maybe there is still room for improvement in the service, but don't doubt it. Such a city can not be compared with big cities like Beijing and Shanghai. I think they are simple and honest.The enthusiasm has filled some shortcomings on their hardware, after all, everyone in Northwest China knows very well.If I come here again, I will choose to live here, and I will also introduce my friends here,^_^, objective and not objective, or try it by myself, this is my experience^_^, if you go to Jiayuguan, remember to eatThe lamb skewers are pretty good and cheap. It is interesting to go to the tower to see it."
1,性价比还不错，对面就是新光天地百货，逛街很不错！,The cost -effectiveness is not bad. The opposite is Xinguang Tiandi Department Store. Shopping is very good!
1,早餐是免费的，酒店不错了，价格好啊，设备有点老式。我感觉挺满意的了,"Breakfast is free, the hotel is good, the price is good, the equipment is a bit old -fashioned.I feel very satisfied"
1,房间还算干净，但洗澡绝对不可以2个卫生间一起洗，可能是一间房间只有一个煤气淋浴器的关系。厨房里的厨具说心里话我是不会去用的，可能我有点洁癖吧，吃的东西还是当心点好。微波炉不错，用的着，那些锅具实在是......总体来说如果是朋友多的话，象过集体生活一样，蛮热闹的。,"The room is quite clean, but bathing must not be washed together in 2 bathrooms. It may be that there is only one gas shower in a room.I do n’t use the kitchen utensils in the kitchen. Maybe I ’m a little cleanliness.The microwave oven is good. It is used. Those pots are really ... In general, if there are many friends, it is quite lively like a collective life."
0,这是我住过的最差的酒店，房间气味难闻，刚打了灭蚊药水，换了三个房间还是如此，服务员说：“住久了就习惯了，每个宾馆都有自己的味道。”考！我又不是来体验生活的。周围环境复杂，脏乱差。,"This is the worst hotel I have lived in. The smell of the room was unpleasant. I just hit the mosquito extinguishing potion and changed the three rooms. The waiter said, ""I have been used to it for a long time..""Test!I am not here to experience life.The surrounding environment is complicated and dirty."
1,"这是我第二次入住了,非常不错的酒店.非常干净.整洁。里面的卫生间是我非常喜欢的布置。晚上12点回酒店的时候想吃点东西，厨师都已下班，在水吧点了份水果色拉，正好看见一只苹果，就问厨师能不能只把苹果切了，别的也不用放。那厨师居然说“送给你们吧，”我问多少不要钱吗？他说“不用了”。真是态度超好哦。从来没有见过这么大方的呢。每天都有当天的报纸。","This is the second time I have stayed in, very good hotel. Very clean. Clean.The bathroom inside is the arrangement I like very much.When I returned to the hotel at 12 o'clock in the evening, I wanted to eat something. The chefs were out of get off work. I ordered a fruit color pull in the water bar. Just when I saw an apple, I asked the chef if I could cut the apple just, and I didn't need to put it.The chef actually said, ""Give you it,"" I asked how much money did I ask?He said, ""No need.""It's really good.I have never seen such generous.Every day there are newspapers that day."
1,觉得是许昌最好的酒店，性价比相当高房间大，整洁，硬件也不错服务相当的好自助早餐也不错离春秋广场很近，出去玩也方便,"I think it is Xuchang's best hotel. The price is quite high in the room, clean, and good hardware. The good buffet breakfast is also very close to the Spring and Autumn Plaza. It is convenient to go out to play."
1,打车到客运站需要12元（加1元燃油费），要的是经济间，所以勉强一些算满意吧，主要是价位摆在那里的，如果有机会还会取得。主要是靠近山东省内最大的游乐园富华游乐园比较好，玩得方便。,"It takes 12 yuan to take a taxi to the passenger station (plus 1 yuan fuel fee). What you want is the economy, so force some satisfaction, mainly the price is placed there, if you have the opportunity, you will get it.It is mainly close to the largest amusement park in Shandong Province, and it is better to play."
1,卫生间门是坏的，面巾纸也没有，房间内也不暖和，服务更不怎么样，还比不上当地4星的酒店，特别是前台和礼宾。住了就不想再住,"The bathroom door is bad, the facial tissue paper is not, the room is not warm, and the service is not very good. It is not as good as the local 4 -star hotel, especially the front desk and rituals.I don't want to live again when I live"
1,酒店五一期间不对外打折，经过电话咨询后，酒店和携程沟通后放开了空余房间，我们顺利的预定了二间房间。酒店硬件还不错，但床不是很舒适的那种。可能是五一期间，早餐品种不多且新补充食品似乎不能及时。我们退房时候匆忙，忘记一个房间内柜子中放置的备用衬衫和裤子了，幸亏服务员查房比较仔细，在结账时及时送还了衬衫和裤子；但我们将一本考试用书忘记在另外一个房间的桌子抽屉了。我们在第二天晚上20:30才发现，当时已经到太原了，电话联系酒店大堂副理（男的），对话里对话先是推托说明天再答复，后来说查一下告诉我结果。后来打来电话说客房没有。我又打电话问了客房部，客房部的一位王姓的小姐告知我他们发现的该书，问如何给我。真是感谢她！我请她代记录下我北京家的地址和邮编，请她们帮忙EMS快递一下，邮费由我出（选择对方付款）。第三天上午，我再次电话给客房部，说书已经送达前台了，真晕。幸亏碰到了大堂经理李小姐，她答应用EMS给我快递，并垫付了邮资（因为当地没有对方付款选项），我当晚在石家庄上网后，通过网站银行给李经理的账户转账了邮资。感谢李经理！同样是经理，差别怎么这么大呢？,"The hotel did not discount during May 1st. After the phone consultation, the hotel and Ctrip communicated after communicating with the room. We successfully scheduled two rooms.The hotel's hardware is not bad, but the bed is not very comfortable.It may be that during the May Day, there are not many breakfast varieties and new supplementary foods seem to be unable to timely.When we got out of the room, we hurriedly, forgot to forget the spare shirts and pants in a cabinet in the room. Fortunately, the waiter was more careful and returned the shirt and pants in time when checking out;The table drawer.We only discovered at 20:30 the next night that they had arrived at Taiyuan at that time, and they contacted the Deputy Manager of the Hotel Hall (male). The conversation in the dialogue first pushed the trust and replied, and later checked and told me the result.Later, I called and said there was no room.I called and asked the room department again. A lady of Wang's surname of the guest room told me how they found the book and asked me how to give me.Thank you so much!I invited her to record the address and postcode of my Beijing family on behalf of my Beijing family, and ask them to help EMS express it. The postage was issued by me (select the other party to pay).On the morning of the third day, I called the guest room again, and the book has been delivered to the front desk, which is really dizzy.Fortunately, she met Ms. Li, the lobby manager, and she agreed to use EMS to express me and paid the postage (because there was no other party's payment option). After I went online at Shijiazhuang that night, she transferred the postage to Manager Li's account through the website bank.Thank you Manager Li!The same manager, why is the difference so big?"
0,"房间不错,但服务质素极低,服务员态度生硬,冷淡.入住两晚,虽然大部份时间都在外游玩,但也没少看服务员白眼,好象咨询下的士的状况也打扰了该酒店高贵的服务员.","The room is good, but the service quality is extremely low. The waiter's attitude is stiff and cold. Two nights of staying in. Although most of the time is playing outside, I do n’t see the waiter Baiyan.Noble waiter."
0,"这家酒店是写字楼改建,无论是整体装修,房间设施,服务水准都离4星级酒店相差甚远.奇怪的是,这样差的酒店居然好评如潮???请大家擦亮双眼,千万不要住这家酒店.","This hotel is converted from office buildings. Whether it is the overall decoration, the room facilities, the service level is far from the 4 -star hotel. Strangely, such a poor hotel is praised.Don't stay in this hotel."
0,"很有趣的酒店,设施什么的都还好了,但是早上我还在睡觉,居然有人拿钥匙开了门就进来了,吓了我一跳,减分不少...","Very interesting hotels, all facilities are okay, but I was still sleeping in the morning. Someone actually opened the door with the key and scared me to jump and reduce a lot of points ..."
1,位置好，服务员热情，早餐不错，电梯也快。,"The location is good, the waiter is enthusiastic, breakfast is good, and the elevator is fast."
1,还不错啦~订的标房~给我了简一室一厅的~好大啊~呵呵~,It's not bad ~ I booked a standard room ~ Give me a simple one room and one living room ~ It's so big ~ huh ~
0,性价比低，房间设施陈旧，房间小的不能再小，有点像监狱。服务一般。宾馆反馈2008年8月8日：谢谢您的评论，首先因为本酒店自身不足给您带来的不便向您道歉。在网络上本酒店设立了七种大小规格不等，价位不等的房型任您选择，同样房间的面积及内部设施也不为相同。我们会不段的提高服务质量，期待您下次光临时提出更宝贵意见。,"The price is low, the room facilities are old, and the rooms are small and small, it is a bit like a prison.The service is average.Hotel feedback on August 8, 2008: Thank you for your comments. First of all, because the hotel itself is not enough to apologize to you.There are seven sizes and specifications on the Internet, and the room types with different prices and prices are allowed to choose from. The area and internal facilities of the same room are not the same.We will improve the quality of service without paragraphs, and we look forward to your next time you make more valuable opinions."
1,"我们定的是2间高级标准间,住一个晚上,感觉不象4星酒店,3星差不多,房间的硬件一般,好多门上的漆都掉了,没有吹风机没有保险箱,大厅不论是服务员还是高级职员态度都很一般,到是2个老门童态度很好.双人床只给一个早餐,很惨.不过象这种小地方也就这样了,下次不会去住了,378元来说性价比不高.","We set up two high -level standard rooms. Living for a night, it feels like a 4 -star hotel. The 3 -star is similar.The staff attitude is very average. It is a good attitude of two old children. The two beds only give one breakfast, which is miserable. But this is the case like this small place.The cost performance is not high."
1,很好，就是早餐需要改进，希望增加房间上网,"Very good, that is, the breakfast needs to be improved, I hope to increase the room online"
0,"7月21日就提交了订单，结果7月26日我们其中2个朋友先行到达酒店，他们由于2人中一位未带有效证件，结果前台足足让他们等了一个小时也不给他们解决（据前台说是7.25接到公安局的通知，每位住店客人必须提供证件），本身恰逢奥运期间公安部门提出这样的要求，我们作为中国公民全力配合也无可厚非，但是酒店的几个作法实在是让我们无法忍受：1、7月25日晚我们曾经致电酒店，但是酒店根本未提醒我们有如此新规定，同时在我们提交订单近一星期内也未有酒店或携程事前通知我们；2、我们2位朋友足足等了一个小时后，我们也赶到了酒店，又把我们晾在一边达1个多小时，只顾给其他客人办理手续，不给我们提供解决的方法；3、作为号称6星级的酒店，此事件自始至终前台人员未见到笑脸，似乎错全在客人这边，难道号称与国际接轨的6星级酒店就是这样培训员工的；4、我们要求酒店提供公安部门下发的相关文件，结果前台人员回答，是公安部门电话下达的，酒店没有文件，作为一名有稍有常识的公民，在当今这样的信息化时代，政府部门都遵循信息公开的原则，若真有诸如此类的文件下达，也不至于会如此不正规操作把，故此我们十分怀疑酒店的说法。5、在于酒店交涉后，酒店人员竟然十分蛮横的回答，如果我们不能按照他们的要求做，就不接待我们了，鄙人实在对“半岛”品牌的规范度、信誉度感到十分震惊，室外是高达40多度的高温，我们是驱车2个半小时才到达酒店的，难道真正的“半岛”集团酒店会如此对待他们的客人。（后得知此半岛是盗用香港半岛名称，不知香港半岛酒店管理集团得知有这样的“李鬼”兄弟会做何感想，也不知当地工商管理部门是如何会让这种水准的团队使用享有盛名的“半岛”品牌的）；6、期间有一位身着经理服装的女士出来接待，都是说2句话就跑开，号称去请示上级，一请示就是15、20分钟，真不知这位经理是什么级别，更有甚者，此位经理还出言不逊，说出门带证件是常识问题，我们斗胆问一句“那信息提前公开告知”是否就不是常识问题了，似乎我们都是些没有常识的人，似乎我们这些没有常识的客人是不配入住这种“高贵”的酒店的，这是对客人的极度不尊重，是对我们客人人格的极大侮辱。7、我们本着息事宁人的态度提出从上海将证件传真至酒店，请酒店先行办理checkin手续，结果前台也是出尔反尔，一会说可以，一会又不行了，最后也是在我们态度强硬的情况下，足足耗了1个小时后才满足了我们这群饥肠辘辘的客人的基本要求；8、checkin手续办完后，突然又说只能给我们2个房间，说其中一个房间还在打扫，我们看了时间，此时已是中午12点35分了，按照国际管理，当天客人入住最晚应在12点，我们实在是对此酒店的服务水平大大怀疑；9、我们预定了泳池湖景房，结果根本看不到湖，真不知这个湖景从何而来；10、凌晨4.：45分，竟然有2位男客人到泳池游泳，影响到我们根本无法入睡，酒店竟无一人前去劝阻。归于以上种种（还有许多细节不满之处不再一一叙述），我们真诚的对携程网提出我们的建议，此种水准的酒店以后真是不要再推荐了，一来使客人遭受折磨，二来也大大有损贵网站声誉！补充点评2008年8月2日：对于该酒店不负责任，缺乏诚意的反馈，实在是有愧于挂出的“六星”标志,我十分赞同楼上朋友的点评“对不起这六星，这家酒店没有管理好，希望下次可以看到新面貌！”：1、酒店既已承认25日就接到公安部门通知，却给予携程网的客服人员26日上午才收到通知的信息，不知如此欺骗公众的酒店如何生存；2、请酒店再次调出当日的录像资料，请你们公司全体高层好好学学什么叫微笑，好好培训你们的前台，你们的前台脸上出现过笑容吗？3、明明是我们的朋友自己提出传真身份证件，而前台一会说可以，一会又说如果没有证件恕酒店不接待，现在竟然变成了酒店总经理决定的事情，那我们只好在此感谢贵酒店总经理的“真诚服务”了；4、请酒店尊重我们的公安部门，难道我们的公安部门作为国家执法机关，会如此不规范、不严谨吗？（前面承认接到指示《凡是入住酒店的客人均需出示身份证登记，否则将对酒店和相关工作人员以及住店当事人均要做出特别时期的严肃处罚》，很明确的使用了书名号，后面又说公安部门不会为此发文，不知酒店如何自圆其说？）5、另外自始至终就是那位不会笑的前台小姐接待的我们，不知酒店所谓“前台其他员工从何而来；6、自己也承认自己是“1881半岛”，难道半岛前面加个“1881”，就和香港九龙“半岛酒店”是一脉相传吗？酒店都不知要尊重客人，却指责客人不尊重酒店，对于酒店如此“真诚”的反馈，我们只好在此很真诚的回复贵酒店，我们是再也不会享用该酒店的“六星”服务了！也奉劝贵酒店，诚信是生存之本，切记！宾馆反馈2008年8月7日：针对你26日入住时无法正常出示身份证登记的情况，酒店方查看了当日录像全过程，并对所有当事人进行了全面调查。奥运会即将开幕，为了确保奥运会及全国人民的平安，25日我们得到公安部门的紧急指示《凡是入住酒店的客人均需出示身份证登记，否则将对酒店和相关工作人员及住店当事人做出特别时期的严肃处罚》。对应您提出的意见，酒店慎重做出以下答复：一、7月25日公安部门强调了必须出示所有住店客人身份证登记的紧急指示，而作为公民入住酒店是必须携带身份证的。这一常识。不需要公安部门做任何发文！希望你懂得。二、你朋友11:40进店至12:25CheckIn手续办好，共45分钟，和你说的等待2小时多不符。正因为我们尊重客人，所以当你和你朋友在大堂吵闹时，我们前台其他员工非常礼貌地为其他住店客人快速办理了checkin。三、无锡1881半岛酒店隶属香港1881半岛酒店集团公司！再次声明！！四、我们1881半岛酒店、可能会对极少个别客人不“尊重”，其目的只是为了更好的尊重服务于其他客人，为其他客人提供更好、更高品质的服务环境。当时相关经理的出现正是想尽快解决问题的，也是在她的协调下，在45分钟的过程中解决了你们的问题。没有一点不尊重你们，更谈不上出言不逊。五、酒店零距离泳池房在你入住前一天是客满的，你预定的房间必须是前日客人退房后(入住1881半岛酒店客人享有住房保留到14:00退房的权利)才能提供给你。我们不可能会因为你的到来，而提前把前住店客人推至门外！按照国际惯例(ctrip的公开公布):14:00是你的入住时间，酒店尊重并遵守了此惯例！六、诽谤及诬蔑是不道德的，1881半岛酒店所有零距离泳池房，都能透过泳池清晰看到全湖景！！其主要特色是客房与游泳池紧相连，也是目前国内最前卫的设计理念。七、对于凌晨有客人游泳，我们也做了相应的调查，有2位住泳池房的醉酒客人，未按照酒店规定时间游泳后，不到5分钟便由保安劝慰回房了，在此深表遗憾。针对你的补充点评，我们做出如下反馈：一、我们酒店实行不卑不亢的微笑服务标准，深知微笑服务的重要性，但是，我们的微笑只会给予值得尊重的客人。二、我们在奥运会期间严格执行公安部门指示，希望你们不要玩一些文字游戏，打书名号只是为了让你们跟上奥运步伐、更清楚的认识到：非常时期出示身份证的重要性。我们真诚欢迎并保护好每一位有素质、有品味的客人，并提供舒适安全的服务环境，反之……","The order was submitted on July 21st. As a result, two of our friends arrived at the hotel on July 26. Because one of the two did not have valid documents, the front desk was enough for them to wait for an hour and did not solve them.(According to the front desk, 7.25 received a notice from the Public Security Bureau, and each store guests must provide documents.) It is justified for the public security department during the Olympic Games.It really makes us unbearable: 1. On the evening of July 25, we once called the hotel, but the hotel did not remind us that we had such new regulations. At the same time, we had not notified us in the near future or Ctrip in the past week; 2, After waiting for an hour after a full time, we also rushed to the hotel and drove us on one side for more than an hour. We only care about the procedures for other guests and do not provide us.The 6 -star hotel, from beginning to end, the front desk staff did not see the smiley face, and it seemed to be all on the side of the guests. Is this the case for 6 -star hotels that are in line with international standards.The relevant documents, as a result, the front desk personnel answered that the public security department was issued by the public security department. The hotel has no documents. As a citizen with a slightly common sense, in the information era of informationization today, government departments follow the principle of information disclosure.The document is issued, and it will not be so irregular, so we are very doubtful that the hotel's statement is very doubtful.5. After the hotel negotiation, the hotel staff answered very well. If we cannot do it according to their requirements, we will not receive us.At the high temperature of more than 40 degrees, we arrived at the hotel for 2 and a half hours. Is it true that the real ""Peninsula"" group hotel will treat their guests like this.(Later, I learned that the peninsula was the name of the Hong Kong Peninsula. I do n’t know what the Hong Kong Peninsula Hotel Management Group learned how to do such a ""Li Gui"" brotherhood.The prestigious ""Peninsula"" brand); 6. During the period, a lady in the manager's clothing came out and ran away.What level of the manager is, and even more, this manager is not good at saying that it is a common sense question to say that the door with documents is common. We boldly ask whether ""the information in advance in advance"" is not a common sense. It seems that we are all unpretentiousPeople, people seem to be unprecedented guests in this ""noble"" hotel. This is extremely disrespectful to guests and a great insult to our guest's personality.7. We proposed to fax from Shanghai to the hotel in accordance with the attitude of the people. Ask the hotel to go through the Checkin procedures first. As a result, the front desk is also reversed.It took 1 hour to meet the basic requirements of our hungry guests; 8. After finishing the procedures after finishing the procedures, I suddenly said that we can only give us 2 rooms.After watching the time, it was already 12:35 noon at this time. According to international management, the guests should be at the latest at the latest of the guests at 12 o'clock.As a result, I couldn't see the lake at all. I really do n’t know where this lake scene came from; 10. In the morning 4.:45, there were two male guests swimming in the pool, which affected us that we could not fall asleep. No one in the hotel went to go.dissuade.Back to the above (there are still many details and dissatisfaction, no more descriptions), we sincerely make our suggestions to Ctrip.com. Do n’t recommend this level of hotels in the future.It also greatly damages the reputation of the website!Supplementary comment on August 2, 2008: It is really ashamed of the ""Six Star"" logo for the hotel's irresponsibility and lack of sincere feedback.The hotel is not well managed. I hope you can see a new look next time! "": 1. The hotel has admitted that it will receive a notice from the public security department on the 25th, but the customer service staff of Ctrip.com will only receive the notice information on the morning of the 26th. I do n’t know if I do n’t knowHow to survive such a hotel that deceives the public; 2. Please call out the video materials of the day again. Please ask all the senior management of your company to learn what is a smile, and train your front desk. Have you ever appeared on your front desk?3. Obviously our friends proposed to fax ID, and the front desk said that it was possible. After a while, if there was no certificate forgive the hotel, the hotel did not receive it, and now it turned out to be the decision of the hotel general manager.The ""sincere service"" of the general manager of your hotel; 4. Ask the hotel to respect our public security department, will our public security department be so irregular and rigorous as a national law enforcement agency?(As mentioned earlier, it is admitted to the instructions that ""Everyone who stays in the hotel must show the ID card registration, otherwise the hotel and related staff and the parties to the store will be made in a special period.""It is also said that the public security department will not post for this, I do not know how the hotel said itself?) 5. In addition, the front desk lady who will not laugh from beginning to end is received.It is the ""1881 Peninsula"". Is it a ""1881"" in front of the peninsula, and is it a vein with the ""Peninsula Hotel"" in Kowloon, Hong Kong? I do n’t know if the hotel is to respect the guests, but accuses the guests from respecting the hotel. The feedback of the hotel is so “sincere”We have to reply to your hotel sincerely here. We will never enjoy the hotel's ""six -star"" service! Also advise your hotel, integrity is the foundation of survival, remember! Hotel feedback on August 7, 2008, 2008: In response to the situation that you cannot show your ID card registration normally on the 26th, the hotel party checked the entire video of the day and conducted a comprehensive investigation of all parties. The Olympic Games is about to open. In order to ensure the safety of the Olympic Games and the people of the country, we on the 25th.Emergency instructions from the public security department ""Every guest who stays in the hotel needs to show the ID card registration, otherwise it will make a serious punishment for the hotel and related staff and the parties to the store.The following answers: 1. On July 25th, the public security department emphasized that the emergency instructions for the registration of all the guests' ID cards must be shown, and as a citizen to stay in a hotel, it must bring an ID card. This common sense. No public security department is required to make any documents!I hope you know. 2. You have a friend at 11:40 to 12: 25checkin for the procedure for 45 minutes. It does not match what you told for 2 hours. Because we respect the guests, when you and your friends are noisy in the lobbyAt the time, other employees in our front desk quickly handled Checkin for other guests of stores. Third, Wuxi 1881 Peninsula Hotel is affiliated to Hong Kong 1881 Peninsula Hotel Group Corporation! Declaration again! 4. Our 1881 Peninsula Hotel may be very rare.Guests do not ""respect"". The purpose is to better respect to other guests and provide a better and higher service environment for other guests. At that time, the appearance of relevant managers wanted to solve the problem as soon as possible.With coordination, you have solved your problem in the process of 45 minutes. There is no disrespect to you at all, let alone speak well. 5. The hotel's zero -distance swimming pool room is full before you stay.After checking out the room the day before, the guests at the 1881 Peninsula Hotel enjoys the right to reserve the house to 14:00) to provide you. We can push the former store guests out of the door because of your arrival!International practice (the public announcement of CTRIP): 14:00 is your staying time. The hotel respects and abides by this practice! 6. Defamation and slander are immoral, all zero -distance pool rooms at 1881 Peninsula HotelYou can clearly see the whole lake through the pool!IntersectionIts main feature is that the guest rooms are closely connected to the swimming pool, and it is also the most avant -garde design concept in China.7. We also conducted a corresponding investigation for guests swimming in the early morning. There were 2 drunk guests who lived in the pool room. After swimming at the prescribed time of the hotel, the security guard was comforted to return to the room.Pity.In response to your supplementary reviews, we make the following feedback: First, our hotel implements a humble smile service standard and knows the importance of smile services. However, our smile will only give guests worthy of respect.2. During the Olympic Games, we strictly execute the instructions of the public security department. I hope you do n’t play some text games. The name of the book is just to let you keep up with the pace of the Olympic Games and clearly realize that the importance of identity cards in a very period.We sincerely welcome and protect every quality and tasteful guest, and provide a comfortable and safe service environment.

1,威斯汀真的是不错，设施环境都很好！几次推荐给外宾入住，都很满意。就是价格较高，适合招待客户。,"Westin is really good, the facility environment is very good!Several recommendations to foreign guests are very satisfied.That is, the price is high, suitable for entertaining customers."
1,6月下旬去丹东，在携程网上预定了丹东国际酒店2天的住宿。24日傍晚抵丹东，便打车去酒店。丹东城市不大，一说国际酒店，司机都知道。酒店在一条不起眼的小街上，周围环境一般。到总台一问，接待员说没有收到携程的预定单。我给他们看了手机收到的携程确认短信，接待员说那好吧，就按携程预定价住下吧。我说，能不能给个朝鸭绿江的房间，接待查了一下电脑，说可以，不过房间小了点，我说没关系，反正一个人住。安排的是15层（接待员还真满足了客人看江的要求），进了房间，往窗外一看，蜿蜒的鸭绿江就在眼前，朝鲜一侧的房屋和农田也清晰可见，稍远处隐约可见鸭绿江桥！房间略显旧了些，但床、被还较整洁、干净。这江景房的性价比应该是超值的！想当年国际酒店在丹东大概是数一数二的，现在来看，装修上比不上新开业的，大堂不太光亮，楼层的电梯口也只开了一小部分灯光，但服务上还不错。服务员遇到客人都会问好。特别值得一提的是23楼的旋转餐厅，可以与深圳国贸和上海新锦江顶楼的旋转餐厅相比拼！毕竟是在丹东那么一个边境小城里。20元的自助早餐较丰盛，再加上可以面对鸭绿江，饱览异国风光（尽管是农田沙洲景色）。在丹东国际酒店2天的停留还是给我留下来不错的印象。,"In late June, I went to Dandong and scheduled for 2 days of accommodation at Dandong International Hotel on Ctrip.On the evening of the 24th, I arrived at Dandong and took a taxi to the hotel.Dandong's city is not large. When it comes to international hotels, the driver knows.The hotel is on an inconspicuous small street with a normal environment.When I asked the head station, the receptionist said that he did not receive the reservation form from Ctrip.I showed them the Ctrip received by the mobile phone to confirm the SMS.I said, can I give a room towards the Yalu River room and check the computer, say yes, but the room is a bit smaller, I said it is okay, anyway, I live alone.The 15th floor is arranged (the receptionist really meets the requirements of the guests to see the river). After entering the room, looking out the window, the winding Yalu River is in front of you, and the houses and farmland on the side of North Korea are clearly visible.Vaguely visible Yalu River Bridge!The room is slightly old, but the bed is cleaner and clean.The cost -effectiveness of this Jiangjingfang should be value -for -money!At that time, the international hotel was probably one of the best in Dandong. Now, the decoration is not as good as the newly opened. The lobby is not very bright. The elevator mouth of the floor has only a small part of the light, but the service is not bad.The waiter will ask the guests.It is particularly worth mentioning that the rotary restaurant on the 23rd floor can compare with the rotary restaurant on the top floor of Shenzhen Guomao and the top floor of Shanghai Xinjinjiang!After all, it is in a small border town in Dandong.The 20 yuan buffet breakfast is more abundant, and you can face the Yalu River to enjoy the scenery of the other country (although it is a farmland sandbar view).The two -day stay at Dandong International Hotel still left me a good impression."
0,"这个酒店太差了,酒店里竟然还有公司,而且还很多,见过这样的酒店吗？我是第一次,下回不会再住了,上下班高峰时,下楼要25分钟,我计算过连亲着两天.门童像个爷爷一样对你爱搭不理的.","This hotel is too bad, there are companies in the hotel, and there are many.

1,性价比比较高，在临海属于比较好的酒店了，老酒店翻新,The cost performance is relatively high. It is a better hotel in Linhai. The old hotel is refurbished
1,装修比较新，离购物点有点距离，要出门拐右，第一条马路再拐左，大约走15分钟才到购物中心。周围有2家电器卖场，马路对面就是药店，可买片仔癀或茵胆平肝胶囊,"The decoration is relatively new. It is a bit distance from the shopping point. If you go out, turn right. The first road will turn to the left. It takes about 15 minutes to go to the shopping mall.There are 2 electrical stores around, and the pharmacy opposite the road can buy a tablet or Yinyin liver capsule"

1,酒店位置很好，出行打车非常方便，很不错的公寓式酒店。特别是行政楼，边吃早餐即可把房退了，很方便，不用上上下下赶。下次还会入住！,"The hotel location is very good. It is very convenient to travel and taxis. A good apartment hotel.Especially the administrative building, you can retreat the house while eating breakfast. It is very convenient, without having to catch up and down.I will stay next time!"
1,酒店的位置不错，附近都靠近购物中心和写字楼区。以前来大连一直都住，但感觉比较陈旧了。住的期间，酒店在进行装修，翻新和升级房间设备。好是好，希望到时房价别涨太多了。,"The hotel's location is good, near the shopping mall and office area nearby.I used to live in Dalian before, but I felt more old.During the stay, the hotel is being renovated, renovated and upgraded the room equipment.Good, good, I hope house prices will not rise too much at that time."
1,环境不算豪华，但是还算干净。吃饭很贵，不如去边上海滩边的大排档划算。海景房看风景还算好，晚上能听到海浪声。有免费的车位。,"The environment is not luxurious, but it is clean.It is expensive to eat, it is better to go to the stalls by the beach by the beach.The sea view room is pretty good to see the scenery, and you can hear the sound of the waves at night.There are free parking spaces."
1,各项设施都符合四星级酒店的标准。只是不明白，为什么一张大床比较稀罕，非比两张床的房间贵不可。好像亦庄那种到处是荒地的酒店，连放几张床的库房都没有。,"All facilities meet the standards of four -star hotels.I just don't understand why a large bed is relatively rare, which is more expensive than the two beds.It seems that Yizhuang's hotels are everywhere, and there are no warehouses in a few beds."
0,"设施陈旧,早餐不太丰富只能说是一般般了","Old facilities, breakfast is not rich, but it can only be said to be average"
0,紧邻马路和高架，房间非常吵闹！严重影响休息。宾馆反馈2008年3月13日：您好，非常感谢您提出的宝贵意见，现在我酒店进行全面装修后，已安装了双面隔音玻璃，吵闹声已得到很大改善，期待你下一次入住银河大酒店！,"Being close to the road and elevated, the room is very noisy!Seriously affect rest.Hotel feedback on March 13, 2008: Hello, thank you very much for your valuable opinions. Now after our hotel is fully renovated, double -sided sound insulation glass has been installed. The noise has been greatly improved. I look forward to your next time you stay in the Galaxy Galaxy.big hotel!"
1,预定了套间，入住发现没有房间，但是与携程交涉后，酒店很快升级为总统套房，很满意，下次还会来,"I booked a suite. I found that there were no rooms in check -in, but after negotiating with Ctrip, the hotel quickly upgraded to a presidential suite, very satisfied, I will come next time"
1,"服务不错,房间也很好,叫车比较方便,就是周边没有超市.另外,就是早餐实在是不与酒店成正比.一是品种太少,二是比较难吃.","The service is good, the room is also very good, it is more convenient to call the car, that is, there is no supermarket around. In addition, breakfast is not proportional to the hotel. One is that there are too few varieties, and the other is more unpalatable."
1,位置不错，上海徐家汇中心地带，性价比一般，房间比较大,"The location is good, the center of the Xujiahui in Shanghai, the cost performance is average, the room is relatively large"
0,"房间太小,到总台拿房间居然说我没有预定,还要在打电话到携程去确认!","The room was too small. I took the room in the main station and said that I did not book, and I had to call Ctrip to confirm it!"
1,地理位置很好，离洋货市场很近。房间装修还可以，就是有点小。电视是液晶的，总体感觉不错。,"The geographical location is very good, and it is very close to the foreign goods market.The decoration of the room is okay, it is a bit small.The TV is LCD, and it feels good in general."
1,服务做的很好，是最近住的最为满意的酒店。不管是前台还是客房的服务都很满意。在很多细节方面做得很好！楼下有家韩国餐厅也不错，我去的时候因为是第一天开，还送了一道菜给我。送的菜比我点的东西还贵。第一次主动给酒店做点评，因为我觉得好酒店值得大家去住一下！,"The service is doing well, it is the most satisfactory hotel recently.Whether it is the front desk or the service of the guest room, it is very satisfied.Do well in many details!There is a Korean restaurant downstairs. It is also good. When I went, I was opened for the first day and gave me a dish.The dishes I gave are more expensive than I ordered.The first time I took the initiative to comment on the hotel, because I think good hotels are worth everyone to stay!"
1,服务态度没得说，从门童到前台，服务水平可以用完美来形容。给人一种回家的感觉，真的很亲切。房间条件还可以，住起来的感觉不错，只是卫生间淋浴设施亟待提高，龙头问题很不好，还有就是里面的饮用水直接从水龙头接的，漂白剂很多，喝起来口感很不好。（在入住期间由于市区管道维修赶上停水，很尴尬，询问前台很快就给予答复，并且态度很好）。服务真的没得说！周围环境很好，虽然比邻闹市区，但晚上的环境很安静，而且离中间很近，购物餐饮都比较方便，走上几分钟就能到海边，感觉很惬意。值得推荐,"The service attitude is not to say that the service level can be described as perfect from the door child to the front desk.It feels like a feeling of going home.The conditions of the room are okay. It feels good to live, but the bathroom shower facilities need to be improved urgently. The faucet problem is very bad. There is also the drinking water inside directly from the faucet. There are many bleaching agents. The taste is very bad.(During the check -in period, because the urban pipeline maintenance caught up with the water, it was embarrassing. Ask the front desk to give a reply soon, and the attitude was very good).The service really doesn't have to say!The surrounding environment is very good. Although the urban area is adjacent to the city, the environment at night is very quiet, and it is very close to the middle. It is more convenient for shopping and catering. It can go to the sea for a few minutes. It feels very comfortable.Recommended"
1,我们住的是标准客房优点：1、设施还算齐全2、地理位置不错缺点：1、隔音效果太差，另外一个房间洗澡、开水龙头的声音感觉就响在自己耳边一样，搞的我一个晚上睡眠都不太好2、被子感觉实在是硬，不舒服,We live in the advantages of standard rooms: 1. Facilities are quite complete. 2. The geographical location is good: 1. The sound insulation effect is too poor. The sound of a bath and a faucet in another room feels like it is in my ears.Sleeping at night is not very good. 2. The quilt feels really hard and uncomfortable
1,"房间够大，设施一般，可以免费上网,可惜没有早餐；停车场很大,自驾车交通方便；楼下面对着那个生意超级好的夜总会，一直吵到凌晨2点。总体觉得：在汕头来说，性价比还是可以接受的。补充点评2007年10月30日：住了两次，9楼和6楼，感觉相同。","The room is large enough, the facilities are average, you can access the Internet for free, but there is no breakfast; the parking lot is very large, and it is convenient for self -driving traffic; the nightclub under the top of the floor is noisy until 2 am in the morning.Overall feel that in Shantou, the price -performance ratio is still acceptable.Supplementary comment on October 30, 2007: Stay twice, 9th and 6th floor, it feels the same."

0,和莫泰金华店比起来，这家差多了。但和黄山其他酒店比起来，价格还算便宜。携程的价格和门市价一样，而且不含早，没有一点优势。但如果加入莫泰会员，就比门市价便宜20元，还含早，所以我花了50元买了张会员卡。这家店现在热衷于做团队生意，对我们这些散客来说是不好的消息，因为稍大的房都改成标准间了，我要的大床双人房就在电梯旁，团队出发早，就显得非常吵，睡不好，而且房间非常小，小得令人惊叹，无法转身，第二天贴了钱换到标准间去了。餐厅也简陋得令人惊叹。入住这家要做好心理准备。,"Compared with Motai Jinhua store, this one is much worse.But compared with other hotels in Huangshan, the price is cheap.Ctrip's price is the same as the store price, and it does not include early, and there is no advantage.However, if you join the Motai member, it will be 20 yuan cheaper than the market price, so I spent 50 yuan to buy a member card.This shop is now keen to be a team business. It is bad news for us, because the larger rooms are changed to a standard room. The big bed and double room I want is next to the elevator.It seems very noisy, I ca n’t sleep well, and the room is very small, which is amazing. I ca n’t turn around.The restaurant is also amazing.Be prepared for this family."

0,"2008年1月10日晚入住该酒店,环境很不错,很安静。我住在卧仙楼具体房间记不得了，好象是3115。22点开始，我觉得房间特别的吵，寻找一圈后发现，我的房间和隔壁房间只隔一道门，而且底下有很大的缝隙。噪音是从隔壁传来的。隔壁不知道住的是什么人，把音乐声音开的很大，还是迪厅音乐。另外，还有好象很多的男男女女的嬉笑声。实在忍无可忍，打电话给了客房服务。随后有服务人员到了隔壁反映情况，然后隔壁稍有收敛。但是不一会儿情况照旧，我本想冲过去与之理论，但是单身在外，还是忍了。就这样，一夜难眠。直接影响了我第二天的工作状态。在此，提出强烈抗议，希望能够以后不要什么不三不四的人都往酒店里","At the hotel on the evening of January 10, 2008, the environment was very good and quiet.I ca n’t remember in the specific room of the Langxianlou. It seems that it starts at 3115. 22 points. I think the room is particularly noisy. After looking for a circle, I found that my room and the next room were only separated by one door, and there were very large underneath.The gap.Noise came from next door.I do n’t know who is living next door. The sound of music is loud, or the music of the Di Hall.In addition, there are laughter of many men and women.It was unbearable and called the guest room service.Subsequently, the service staff went to the next door to reflect the situation, and then a slight convergence of the next door.But after a while, the situation was always theory. I wanted to rush to the theory of the past, but I still endured single.In this way, it was difficult to sleep overnight.It directly affected my work status the next day.Here, a strong protest, hoping that people who do not have nothing in the future will go to the hotel"
0,环境还算可以，可能是当地饮食文化跟东莞有不同的原固，中餐分为二层，一层饮茶，一层食饭，本人想食饭的，但去错饮茶楼层，而且开了茶位，（每一种茶收十元）后来转去食饭楼层时也要把那饮茶楼层的茶位费一起结算，但我在食饭时也开了茶位啊？他们说是分开核算的，这就等于我重复交茶位费了，真气人！,"The environment is okay. It may be that the local food culture is different from Dongguan. The Chinese food is divided into two floors, one layer of tea, one layer of meals, and I want to eat rice, but go to the wrong tea floor and open it.Tea, (10 yuan for each kind of tea) Later, when I transferred to the meal floor, I also had to settle the tea toll on the tea drinking floor together, but I also opened the tea position when I eat meals?They said that they were calculated separately, which is equivalent to me repeating the fees of tea."
0,房间里的确有味道，电梯里也有，给人第一印象不是很好；服务员的服务态度不太好，面无表情的；没有宾至如归的感觉；200元的标准间，不是很大，但是还可以将就；遥控器不好用，给前台打电话催了好几次，才来人看看，说是接触不好，也没有多余的可以更换；晚上临睡前关电视是手动关的；距离肯德基很近；如果有别的选择，以后不会再住这家；,"There are indeed taste in the room, and there are also in the elevator. The first impression is not very good; the waiter's service attitude is not very good, and there is no expression; there is no guest to return to home;It will be just; the remote control is not easy to use. I called the front desk several times before I came to see it, saying that it was not good to contact, and there were no extras to be replaced.Very close; if there are other choices, you will not live in this one in the future;"
1,"房间新装修的,作为万豪的金卡会员,给我升级免费宽带和免费早餐,这点比无锡万怡好很多了.前台的笑脸不多,但和之前相比的话,进步很多了.鼓励一下.","The newly renovated room, as a member of the Golden Card of Marriott, upgrade me for free broadband and free breakfast, which is much better than Wuxi Wanyi. There are not many smiley faces at the front desk, but compared with previously, it has improved a lot. Encourage it.Then, then"
1,酒店位置不错，出门去转转还很方便。单人间小了些，但还是有五星级风范的，房间稍旧了些，但性价比还是不错的。,"The hotel location is good, and it is convenient to go out to go around.Single people are smaller, but there are still five -star style. The room is slightly older, but the cost performance is still good."
1,看到网友评价说最好不要3楼和5楼的房间，但是不幸还是被指定为3楼，问前台，问了还是等于白问，就是告诉你没有了。房间设施一般，洗面盆的冷水超级小，只有热水才是大的，害得我洗衣服超级不爽。服务还可以，给了小费后房间服务员立刻多给我们3瓶水。酒店最大的好处就是离DFS超级近，大包小包可以放回房间后继续去其他地方逛。,"Seeing netizens commented that it is best not to do the room on the third and 5th floors, but unfortunately it is still designated as the third floor. Asked the front desk, it is still equivalent to asking you that it is gone.The room facilities are average. The cold water of the noodle basin is super small. Only hot water is large, which makes me wash clothes.The service is okay. Immediately after the tip, the room waiter gave us 3 bottles of water.The biggest benefit of the hotel is that it is super close to DFS. Big bags can be put back in the room and continued to visit other places."
1,"我07年10月19日入住,确实是休闲的好去处,有空还会去.不足之处是山庄酒店菜色一般,入住那天不知为什么上不了网,虽然叫了人来查看,但还是未曾上网.","I stayed on October 19, 2007. It was indeed a good place for leisure, and I would go when I was free.Then, then"
1,7月23日-26日住了三晚，338的大床房，床是2米*2米的，超爽，其它房间内设施一般，稍微陈旧了一点，不过影响不大，跟破旧还差得远！整体感觉这个价位还基本可以，不过要是跟酒店四星的牌子比，最多也就是三星标准而已！有一个问题请酒店方注意，不知道我这个是个案还是普遍现象――房间里的电话竟然不能用，连市话都要收费，而且还要交押金后才开通，这点来讲是我在酒店里头一次遇见，确实有点夸张。既然开通，干脆把电话撤了算了，免得看着碍眼。宾馆反馈2008年8月11日：感谢您选择入住我们宾馆及为我们提出的宝贵意见。对您提出的意见我们也将及时做出整改。我们已向领导反映领导也及时做出批示，以后入住商务房型的客人市内电话一律免费。希望您下次还能选择入住我们宾馆，再给我们提出更多宝贵的意见，只有这样我们宾馆才会不断提升。最后，再次感谢您！,"I lived for three nights from July 23 to 26. The large bed room of 338 was 2 meters*2 meters. It was super cool. The facilities in other rooms were average, but it was a little old.Far!Overall feels that this price is basically possible, but if it is compared with the four -star brand of the hotel, it is the Samsung standard at most!There is a question, please pay attention to the hotel side. I do n’t know if this is a case or a common phenomenon -the phone in the room is unavailable. Even the market talk is charged, and it will only be opened after paying the deposit. In this regard, I am in the hotel.It was a bit exaggerated when I met it.Now that you open it, you can simply withdraw the phone, so as not to look at it.Hotel feedback on August 11, 2008: Thank you for choosing to stay in our hotel and the valuable opinions on us.We will also make rectifications in time on your opinions.We have reported to the leaders that the leaders have also made instructions in a timely manner. In the future, guests in the city who stay in business housing types are free of charge.I hope you can choose to stay in our hotel next time, and then give us more valuable opinions. Only in this way will our hotel continue to improve.Finally, thank you again!"
0,"到半夜竟然没暖气,怎么住啊????!!!!!!!!!!","There is no heating in the middle of the night, how to live ???? !!!!!!!!!!!"
1,酒店不错，地理位置好，外形气派，江景房正对名山鬼城。停车场够大，保安负责。就是遇到一件不愉快的事：一个看上去像是个主管的工作人员居然在大门口（宾馆大门比较小气）跟我们抢（进）门，好像不太应该。,"The hotel is good, the geographical location is good, and the appearance is elegant.The parking lot is large enough, and the security guard is responsible.It is a unpleasant thing to encounter: a staff member who looks like a supervisor is actually at the gate (the door of the hotel is relatively stubborn) to grab (enter) the door. It seems that it doesn't seem to be."
1,选择万狮的最主要原因还是其地理位置，每次下了飞机不用再坐车跑到市区去，而且万狮是去祁县，太谷的首选落脚点，房间还不错，但是没有国贸好，也没什么大的缺点，自助餐感觉还不错,"The main reason for choosing Wan Lion is its geographical location. Every time you get off the plane, you do n’t have to take a car to the urban area, and Wan Lion is going to Qixian. Taigu ’s preferred point is good.There is no big disadvantage, the buffet feels pretty good"
1,"庭院环境很好,房间也还可以,设施有一些旧了,总台有位小姐服务稍差了些，但总体还可以。","The courtyard environment is very good, the room is okay, there are some old facilities. The service of a lady in the main station is slightly worse, but it is okay."
0,"我住的是豪华套房,折后价是2990,但是入住后发现性价比极低,套房是在前面一幢楼,最高是9楼,完全看到不前面人民广场的风景,而且房间比较小,是我住过的五星级套房中最小的,以后绝对不会再选择这个酒店了.","I live in a luxury suite. The price is 2990, but after check -in, I found that the price / performance ratio is extremely low. The suite is in the front building and the highest is 9th floor.The smallest of the five -star suites I have lived, and I will never choose this hotel in the future."
0,套房面积挺大。最吃惊的是案头上放了文房四宝，差点动了留下到此一游的墨宝的念头，最后还是罢了。床很大，但被单不是太舒服。景观餐厅东西太贵，强烈不推荐。住房客人素质不高，感觉到了乡镇企业家聚会场。下次还是选择4星的吧。,"The suite area is quite large.The most surprising thing was that the four treasures of the study room were placed on the case, and the idea of Mo Bao, who was left here, and finally. In the end, it was still.The bed is large, but it is not too comfortable to be alone.The landscape restaurant is too expensive, and it is not recommended.The quality of housing guests is not high, and I feel the township entrepreneur gathering venues.I will choose 4 stars next time."
1,正如其他客人所评价的那样，在大同能有这么一家酒店实在不错，房间比较干净，卫生间较小，要命的是洗澡水温度太难调节，忽冷忽热，容易感冒。要是这个问题解决了，这家酒店就更好了。,"As other guests evaluated, there is such a hotel in Datong, the room is relatively clean, the bathroom is small, the temperature of the bath water is too difficult to adjust, it is cold and hot, and it is easy to catch a cold.If this problem is solved, this hotel will be better."

1,"总体比我想象的要好.不错,下次还会考虑入住","Overall it is better than I imagined. Not bad, I will consider check -in next time"
1,餐厅可以签单。我觉得内部环境不错，很有点情调。就是价格较贵。谭家菜名头很大，吃起来并不怎么样。有个马术俱乐部，觉得新鲜，去了之后发现很小，很萧条。,"The restaurant can sign the bill.I think the internal environment is good and a little emotional.It is more expensive.The Tan family cuisine is very famous, and it is not very good.There is a equestrian club that feels fresh. After I went, I found very small and very depressed."
0,酒店在装修，气味很大。我离开酒店时，我记得很清楚把一串西藏天珠遗漏在房间了，过了三小时才突然想起来，后来打电话给酒店总台，可收拾房间的服务员硬是说没看到，难道佛祖显灵，让佛珠自己会飞？估计是服务员自己拿了，又不好意思交出来，真的是服务员的品德有问题！那是一串很有纪念价值的佛珠，可惜了！宾馆反馈2008年8月8日：非常抱歉发生了这样的事情，关于阁下反映的问题，我们感到非常惊讶。酒店管理层及时做了相应的调查，但就目前掌握的情况还不能确认是当班服务员拿走了阁下的佛珠。但无论结果怎样酒店都会采取措施，加强员工的职业道德建设，尽可能杜绝此类事情的再次发生！我宾馆按五星级标准装修的24-26楼高层观景客房即将竣工，期待阁下光临！！,"The hotel is decorated and the smell is very large.When I left the hotel, I remembered that I missed a series of Tibetan beads in the room. After three hours, I suddenly remembered it. Later, I called the hotel head station.Express, let the bead fly by yourself?It is estimated that the waiter took it by himself, and he was embarrassed to make it out. It was really a problem with the morality of the waiter!It was a bunch of Buddha beads with a very memorable value, but unfortunately!Hotel feedback on August 8, 2008: I am very sorry to happen. We are very surprised about the problems in your own.The hotel management made a corresponding investigation in a timely manner, but the current situation cannot be confirmed that the waiter in the class took away the bead of your will.However, no matter how the hotel, the hotel will take measures to strengthen the professional ethics construction of employees, and to prevent this kind of incident as possible!The high-rise viewing rooms of the 24-26 floor of our hotel according to the five-star standard decoration are about to be completed, and I look forward to visiting!Intersection"
0,从小事看不像四星级酒店：车到门口，门童似看不见，自顾自聊天说话，连啦一下门也没有，早餐品种很少，房间的设施不如三星。但这酒店在黟县算是最好的了，想住的话只能将就了,"It is not like a four -star hotel from a small thing: the car arrives at the door, the door children seem to be invisible, chat and talk about themselves, do n’t even have a good door, there are very few breakfast varieties, and the facilities in the room are not as good as Samsung.But this hotel is the best in Lixian. If you want to live"
1,地段不是很理想，虽然距火车站不远，但走路还有一段距离，打车又不容易打到，许多出租都不愿去车站。另外由于大堂餐厅承包给了个人，所以自助早餐只能在大堂咖啡厅内，设施不完善，品种也少。,"The location is not ideal. Although it is not far from the train station, there is still a distance walking, and it is not easy to hit the taxi. Many rental is unwilling to go to the station.In addition, because the lobby restaurant is contracted to individuals, the buffet breakfast can only be in the lobby cafes, the facilities are not complete, and there are few varieties."
1,"酒店大堂不错,房间设施也物有所值,服务员态度非常好","The hotel lobby is good, the room facilities are also worthwhile, the waiter attitude is very good"

0,这个价位，感觉还没有锦江之星好。房间比较旧。隔音不好，可以听到服务员的对讲机声音，有人关门开门都很大声音。热水出得很慢，空调不凉。下次不来了,"At this price, I feel that there is no good star in Jinjiang.The room is older.The sound insulation is not good. You can hear the sound of the waiter's intercom. Some people close the door and open the door.The hot water is very slow, and the air conditioner is not cold.I won't come next time"
1,酒店总体不错，应该是张家港最好的酒店。但有二个问题。1。浴缸是椭圆的，设计上有问题，洗完淋浴，地上水漫金山。2。不能上VPN，给工作带来极大不便，最后只能用拨号上网来上VPN。,"The hotel is generally good, it should be the best hotel in Zhangjiagang.But there are two problems.1.The bathtub is oval. There are problems with the design. After washing the shower, the water on the ground is long.2.You cannot go to VPN, which brings great inconvenience to the work. In the end, you can only use the dial -up to the Internet to VPN."

1,本人于10月20日入住该酒店，如下建议和意见仅供参考：1、建议入住面山的房间，该类型房间比较紧张，预定时提前告知。2、该酒店闹中取静，在市中心区，交通便利。3、三楼自助餐厅环境不错，可以在此享用中西式自助午餐；比较适意。4、房间内的小阳台同样让人感觉很棒！,"I stayed in the hotel on October 20. The suggestions and opinions are for reference only: 1. I recommend staying in the room in the Manshan. This type of room is relatively tight and inform in advance.2. The hotel is quiet in trouble, in the city center, convenient transportation.3. The environment on the third floor of the buffet restaurant is good, you can enjoy the Chinese and Western buffet lunches here; it is more suitable.4. The small balcony in the room is also very great!"
1,必须开车去，否则肯定找酒店是一项复杂的工程。即使开车，也得带上GPS，真的是不太好找。酒店环境不错，就是这次去，钓鱼、桑拿（女宾部）都没有开放。游泳池很好，水温和清洁度都比较令人满意，虽然外面是雨夹雪，但是室内仍然很好。还有他们的捏脚服务生很好，力道挺足，价格58的话还不算贵。其他消费都是爆贵，周围也没有吃饭消费的地方，所以如果用套餐还是比较好一些。早餐种类少了一些，味道还行，服务生态度都还不错。,"You must drive, otherwise it must be a complex project to find a hotel.Even if you drive, you have to bring GPS, it is really not easy to find.The hotel environment is good. This time, fishing, sauna (female guests) are not open.The swimming pool is very good, and the water temperature and cleanliness are relatively satisfactory. Although it is snowing outside, the room is still very good.There are also their pin -pinch waiters very good, very powerful, and the price is not expensive.Other consumption is expensive, and there are no places to consumption around, so it is better if the package is better.There are fewer types of breakfast, the taste is okay, and the service ecosystem is not bad."
0,本次预定有两点不满意1、由于航班原因我在21日凌晨2点到达酒店，可酒店仍然收取20日房费。2、酒店房间格局极差。网上预定时，不能了解房型。建议增加。3、房间设施陈旧。最可恨的是房间竟然有蟑螂。与服务人员理论时告知：已经是优惠价（言外之意，有蟑螂我也得忍了！没天理！望携程认真核实！,"There are two dissatisfaction in this reservation. 1. Due to the flight, I arrived at the hotel at 2 am on the 21st, but the hotel still charged a 20 -day room fee.2. The hotel room structure is very poor.When you are scheduled online, you cannot understand the room type.It is recommended to increase.3. Old room facilities.The most hateful thing is that there are cockroaches in the room.In the theory of the service staff, inform: It is already a preferential price (the implication of it, I have to endure the cockroaches! Nothing! I hope Ctrip carefully verify it!"
1,在泸州算比较好的酒店，临江风景不错。晚上有桑拿部的服务电话，表面上是为住店客人提供优惠按摩服务，20元/人，钟，实际上在“钓鱼”。,"In Luzhou, a better hotel, Linjiang has a good scenery.In the evening, there is a service phone from the sauna department. On the surface, it provides preferential massage services for guests in the store, 20 yuan/person, clock, in fact ""fishing""."
1,环境非常好!非常安静!设施较旧!餐厅菜肴很好!希望能改进硬件设施!,The environment is very good! Very quiet! The facilities are old! The restaurant dishes are very good! I hope to improve the hardware facilities!
1,经过几次在保定的住宿和其他酒店的比较，发现中银大厦应该是保定最好的酒店了。反正对我来说只要去保定，现在这里就是我的根据地了。比所谓的五星酒店秀兰饭店要好。,"After several comparisons in Baoding's accommodation and other hotels, I found that BOC Building should be the best hotel in Baoding.Anyway, as long as you go to Baoding, now here is my base.It is better than the so -called Five -Star Hotel Xiulan Hotel."
1,紧靠维港，风景非常棒。周边有钓鱼的老人，散步的游客，非常安逸的情景。酒店的服务不错，也很安静，就是逛街不太方便，好在有30分钟一班的穿梭巴士可以送到么地道和尖沙嘴的北京道。旁边新开发的黄埔新天地不怎么样，美食广场和商场都不怎么样。下次再去血拼，我肯定不住这家酒店了，虽然服务很好。,"Close to Victoria Harbor, the scenery is great.There are elderly people around, and tourists walking are very comfortable.The hotel's service is good and quiet, that is, it is not convenient to go shopping. Fortunately, there are 30 minutes of shuttle buses to be delivered to the authentic and Tsim Sha Tsui Beijing Road.The newly developed Huangpu Xintiandi next to it is not good, and the food square and the mall are not good.Next time I go to fight, I can't hold this hotel anymore, although the service is good."
1,"朋友推荐的宾馆,位置方便,价格合理,高楼的房间面积很宽敞,前台登记和退房时间很快,服务感觉不错!值得向各位推荐。酒店斜对面就是汽车总站,还有大型超市,很方便的。","The hotel recommended by a friend is convenient and reasonable. The room area of the high -rise building is very spacious. The front desk registration and check -out time are fast. The service feels good! It is worth recommending to you.The hotel obliquely is the car terminal, and there are large supermarkets, which are very convenient."
1,"前几天刚从武夷山回来,工作之余我也来说说点评点.避开“十一”黄金周，我携家人到武夷山旅游,住的是远华酒店的行政商务房金桂阁,整体来说还挺不错,房间的设施设备都很人性化,现代化，服务小姐都很会笑，让你倍感亲切。像我这样长期居住在都市的人，难得一份宁静，清晨醒来站在酒店房间的阳台上迎面扑来桂花的飘香，让人心旷神怡，在往下一望，哇！园林似的假山瀑布流水，让人感觉置身于世外桃园一般，如果有机会，以后还会再来！强烈推荐朋友们去！","I just came back from Wuyi Mountain a few days ago. I also talk about comments after work. Avoid the ""Eleventh"" Golden Week. I bring my family to Wuyi Mountain to travel.Pretty good, the facilities and equipment in the room are very humane, modern, and the service lady can laugh very well, making you feel kind.People like me who lived in the city for a long time are rare to be quiet. I wake up in the morning and stand on the balcony of the hotel room to rush to the fragrance of osmanthus, which makes people feel refreshed, looking down, wow!The garden -like rockery waterfall flows, which makes people feel like a paradise. If you have a chance, you will come again in the future!Recommend friends strongly!"
1,酒店的服务不错，房间很干净。提出要上网后，就给换了个能上网的房间，上网费也没有收。交通方便，门口就是大连火车站。原本以为会很吵，可以住在17楼，根本就听不到声音。费用方面200多元，感到很值。,"The hotel's service is good and the room is clean.After being proposed to go online, I changed a room that could surf the Internet, and the Internet fee was not charged.The traffic is convenient, and the door is the Dalian Railway Station.I thought it would be very noisy, I could live on the 17th floor, and I couldn't hear the sound at all.For more than 200 yuan in terms of cost, it is worth it."
1,"酒店设施还可以,服务也不错.值得一提的是:早餐不象是所谓的五星级的早餐.门童的服务也不到位!其他都还好!","The hotel facilities are okay, and the service is also good. It is worth mentioning: breakfast is not like the so -called five -star breakfast. The service of Men Tong is not in place! Everything else is okay!"
1,"和其它如家一样,感觉不错.只是打车要说北纬饭店旁司机才知道.","Like other homes, it feels good. It is only to say that the driver next to the Beiwei Hotel will know."
1,"酒店房间比较小,但还温馨舒适,只是浴室的照明比较暗.整体来说还是不错的。酒店前台服务员的服务态度很好,值得表扬，以后有客户入住,还会推荐此酒店.再次表扬前台的服务员.","The hotel room is relatively small, but it is still warm and comfortable, but the lighting in the bathroom is relatively dark. Overall, it is still good.The service attitude of the hotel's front desk is very good and worthy of praise. In the future, there will be customers to stay in, and this hotel will be recommended."
0,电梯维修，只能爬楼，房间不大，设施一般。房间里居然连个大灯都没有，只有一盏远远的台灯晃着暗暗的光。最恐怖的是窗户外面就是走廊，隔音基本为零，只要有人走路说话，都会有回音，特响。清晨就有酒店人员穿着拖鞋嘻嘻哈哈的走过，您就别想睡了。,"Elevator maintenance can only climb the building, the room is not large, and the facilities are average.There was no headlight in the room, and there was only a distant table lamp dangling.The most scary is the corridor outside the window, and the sound insulation is basically zero. As long as someone walks and speaks, there will be echo, special.In the early morning, the hotel staff walked by wore slippers, and don't think about sleeping."
1,在济源，能够有性价比这么高的酒店，有点意外了。房间洗手间还有点4星级的感觉，但也就是一般了。不过说实在，这个价位，住这样的房间，还是挺值的。,"In Jiyuan, it is a bit surprising that can be so cost -effective.The bathroom still has a little 4 -star feeling, but it is general.But to be honest, at this price, living in such a room is still worth it."
1,在广州这个地方能够用此价格入住这种一站式的酒店，实在很划得来。问题是这酒店地形比较难打车和饮食方面比较差，唯一的中餐厅也要1130才开始，连早餐也没有，因为广州市是以点心出名嘛！房间方面还算不错，虽然稍微旧一点，但是地板却很有在家的感觉，蛮舒服的！而且着你的服务员也还不错，虽然手脚做事比较慢但胜在贴心服务和诚恳。,"It is very possible to stay at this one -stop hotel in this place in this price.The problem is that the hotel's terrain is relatively difficult to take a taxi and diet. The only Chinese restaurant will only start at 1130, and there is no breakfast, because Guangzhou is famous for its dim sum!The room is pretty good. Although it is a little old, the floor feels very comfortable at home and is quite comfortable!And your waiter is also good, although your hands and feet are relatively slow, they are better than intimate services and sincerity."
0,房间很小，洗手间有异味，酒店外观陈旧，yi以后不会再住,"The room is very small, there is a odor in the washing room, the appearance of the hotel is outdated, and the Yi will not live in the future"
0,简直不知道携程会选这家店的，除了地段好以外，简直一无是处！房间旧，床垫的钢丝都出来了，单号的房间在6月天开了空调温度都在30度以上。吃早餐没空调。小姐电话乱打，都在12点左右。,"I don't know if Ctrip will choose this store. Except for the good location, it is useless!The old room is old, and the wire of the mattress comes out. The air -conditioning temperature opened in June in June is more than 30 degrees.There is no air conditioning for breakfast.The lady's phone call was around 12 o'clock."
1,我本来一直很喜欢的，可是这次有几个问题想说说：一是酒店门口的服务生太冷漠，形同虚设，我到酒店那天早上下雨，东西很多，打车去的时候他们居然站在那里一动不动，连伸手拉一下车门都没有。如果想要小费我想你做了别人肯定会给你。建议改进，至少可以帮客人拿一下东西吧。二是酒店前台通知不及时，我那天入住的时候说是住两晚上，可是前台服务员只要我压了500元的押金，后来没有通知我，第二天我回酒店就发现门打不开了，打电话问了才告诉我说是押金不够，显然服务一点都不人性化，希望能改进。另外，酒店的行李寄存服务很好，环境也很好，总的来说都很理想，就是希望能改进上面两个问题，做的更好，那样客人会更加喜欢你们宾馆。期待你们的改进和回复。宾馆反馈2008年6月17日：尊敬的携程会员：感谢您们对我们宾馆一直的关注和支持！针对您所反映的问题，我们管理层非常的重视。立即由相关部门结合实际展开调查和核实，同时借鉴您的合理化建议并采取一些有效的整改。从而对您的善意的提醒再次表示感谢！同时也十分感谢携程网提供了这样一个好的平台，希望诸位会员空闲之时多多给我们宾馆提出建议和评价。我们将以真诚的服务态度欢迎诸位的光临！,"I always liked it, but this time there are a few questions that I want to talk about: First, the waiter at the entrance of the hotel is too indifferent, and it is like a false.Without moving, there was no door to pull the door.If you want a tip, I think you will definitely give it to you.It is recommended to improve, at least you can help guests get things.The second is that the hotel's front desk notification is not timely. When I stayed in the same day, I said it was two nights, but as long as I pressed the deposit of 500 yuan, the front desk waiter did not notify me. The next day I returned to the hotel and found that the door could not be opened.I called and asked me that it was not enough for the deposit. Obviously, the service was not human at all, and I hope to improve it.In addition, the hotel's luggage storage services are very good and the environment is very good. In general, it is ideal, that is, I hope to improve the above two problems and do better, so guests will like your hotel more.Looking forward to your improvement and reply.Hotel feedback on June 17, 2008: Dear Ctrip member: Thank you for your attention and support for our hotel!In response to the problems you reflected, our management attaches great importance to it.Immediately conduct investigations and verification by relevant departments in accordance with the actual situation, and learn from your rationalized suggestions and take some effective rectification.Thanks to your goodwill reminder again!At the same time, I am also very grateful to Ctrip.com for providing such a good platform. I hope that when members are free, they will make suggestions and evaluations for our hotels.We will welcome all the people with a sincere service attitude!"
1,"大堂整洁,房间干净,设施齐全,位置方便,早餐也还可以,服务也还不错,只是酒店周围环境不怎么样,但是这和整个南昌老城的整体环境有很大关系.在南昌还算是值得一住的酒店.","The lobby is clean, the room is clean, the facilities are complete, the location is convenient, the breakfast is okay, and the service is not bad, but the environment around the hotel is not good, but this has a lot to do with the overall environment of the entire Nanchang old city.The hotel where you stay."
1,"豪标与普标据说只是卫生间有点不同,但服务员都把豪标认作普标,你说是豪标她还说不是,而服务台说是,搞得不知道是不是给骗了.豪标淋浴头很大\水量也大\很舒服.房里没电脑,有网线接头也没用.","Haojiao and general standards are said to be a bit different in the bathroom, but the waiters recognize the bid as a general standard.

There is no computer in the room, and there is a network cable connector."
0,态度超级不好，我订的普通标准房，结果去了说没有了，说免费升级豪华双标，我一定要有网线的，结果第二天告诉我不能用网，而且房间在附楼，超级远，我东西超级沉，一个姑娘就这样抗着都没有人管。第二天说给换房间，结果打扫人员愣是听不懂前台的普通话，让我扛着行李来回的走，不知道在干什么！！！！结果换了2次，换成了标准房，我怕标准没有豪华好，结果一进去发现不仅在主楼，而且比前一天的豪华好多了！！！！！！至少窗户很大，网线也能用！对于第一天的入住超级不满意，感觉被骗了！！！,"The attitude is super bad. The ordinary standard room I booked. As a result, I said that it was gone. I said that the luxury dual standard for free upgrade. I must have a network line. As a result, I told me that I can’t use the network.In the distance, my things are super heavy, and no one is in control of a girl.The next day, I said to the room to change the room.

I do n’t know what I am doing!IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionAs a result, I changed it twice and replaced it with a standard room. I was afraid that the standards were not luxurious.

0,感觉一般，如果是来旅游的话，离闹市区比较远，有点不便。是地板而不是我所喜欢的地毯，宽带要另外收费不爽，不过有数字电视算是弥补一下了。客房很简单，家具有点小，感觉不够大气，最好笑的是卫生间竟然没有插座。。。。靠马路的房间很吵，虽然有双层窗，但还是不够安静。补充点评2007年5月4日：上面的点评是点评别的宾馆的，搞错了~~~~~~~~~补充一下：地点是在闹市区，去逛街很方便，房间除了是地板，其他还过的去，宽带要收费不爽，早餐一般，不过鱼丸味道还可以,"It feels average. If it is traveling, it is far from the downtown area and a bit inconvenient.It is the floor instead of the carpet I like. The broadband has to be charged uncomfortable, but some digital TVs can be made up for it.The rooms are very simple, the furniture is a bit small, and it feels not enough. The funny thing is that the bathroom has no sockets.EssenceEssenceEssenceThe room on the road is noisy. Although there are double -layer windows, it is still not quiet enough.Supplementary reviews May 4, 2007: The above reviews are at the hotel with a scorch, and it is wrong ~~~~~~~~~~~ It is very convenient to go shopping. The room is very convenient to go shopping.Others are still, the broadband is upset, the breakfast is average, but the fish ball taste is okay"
1,是个悠闲度假的好选择，可惜度假村部分设施没有整理，无法使用，有点可惜！服务人员的态度不是很热情！不过整体来说，还是值得推荐，环境不错！,"It is a good choice for leisurely vacations. Unfortunately, some facilities in the resort are not organized and cannot be used. It is a pity!The attitude of the service staff is not very enthusiastic!But overall, it is still worth recommending, the environment is good!"
0,条件太差！房间面积太小，简直就不象4*酒店！,"The conditions are too bad!The room area is too small, it is not like 4*hotel!"
0,"这是我住过的最脏的店了,说它脏,是两方面,第一就是卫生,房间里的陈设非常陈旧,地毯很脏,桌面很脏,床单很脏,卫生间水池也很脏......我是没敢脱了衣服睡,餐厅卫生也不怎么样,吃饭的时候还得不住手的轰苍蝇......第二就是骚扰电话太讨厌,我和老公入住的是5楼,晚上,正对电梯口的""美发店""开始营业了,里面几个下流打扮的女人,在无所事事的望着来往的客人,等我们进入房间不久,电话就打进来了,后来把电话拔掉了,才能消停的睡觉,总之,这个酒店是我在携程上能订到的最好的酒店了,可还是这个标准,真是和""孔子故里""太不相配了!","This is the most dirty shop I have lived. It is dirty. It is two aspects. The first is hygiene. The furnishings in the room are very old, the carpet is dirty, the desktop is dirty, the sheets are dirty, and the bathroom pool is dirty...... I did n’t dare to take off my clothes to sleep, and the restaurant was not hygienic. I ca n’t help having a flies when I eat ... The second is that the harassment phone is too annoying.It is the 5th floor and at night, the ""hairdressing shop"" at the elevator mouth is starting its business. Several women dressed in inside look at the guests who are doing nothing, and when we enter the room, the phone comes in.The phone was pulled out before I could stop sleeping. In short, this hotel is the best hotel I can order on Ctrip. But this standard is really matched with ""Confucius Hometown""!"
1,"该酒店服务较好,位置也较优越,但出租车大部分不知道怎么走.","The hotel has a good service and a better location, but most of the taxis do not know how to go."
0,北京的酒店，也就是这么着了！五星级酒店也就三星的水平，何况四星的呢，凑合着住吧,"The hotel in Beijing is like this!The five -star hotel is also the level of Samsung, let alone the four -star, do it together"
1,入住了三天，真的不错，早餐很丰富，中西都有，特别是很受我们大城市人的喜爱．六楼的中餐就差了点，海鲜不多，且价格还是高了点，但观景桌只有４个少了点，晚去就坐不到了．茶餐厅的小吃还是可以，人气也比较旺．客房１楼是完全没有阳台的，二楼以上每层也只有８个阳台，订房时还是最好问清楚．客房的颜色很浪漫．宾馆的地理位置是没话好说了，确实不错，靠海每间客房都能看到对岸的鼓浪屿，渡口就在对面，中山路就在边上．本人恰好有天生日，宾馆还是很人心化，送了个小小的生日蛋糕，身在他乡感觉还是有点惊喜！谢谢宾馆的总经理：吴佩英，送来代表宾馆的贺卡和祝福．总得来说服务还是不错的．补充点评2008年8月10日：我会推荐给我的朋友们的．,"After three days of staying, it is really good. Breakfast is rich and there are Chinese and Western, especially the popularity of our big cities.The Chinese food on the sixth floor is a bit worse. There are not many seafood, and the price is still a bit higher, but there are only 4 less viewing tables, and you ca n’t sit at night.The snacks of the tea restaurant are still possible, and the popularity is relatively prosperous.There is no balcony on the first floor of the guest room. There are only 8 balconies on each floor on the second floor. It is best to ask when reservation.The color of the guest room is very romantic.The geographical location of the hotel is nothing to say. It is really good. Every room can be seen on the opposite side of Gulangyu. The ferry is opposite, and Zhongshan Road is on the side.I happened to have a birthday, and the hotel was still very hearty. I gave a small birthday cake. I felt a little surprised in the other country!Thank you for the general manager of the hotel: Wu Peiying, sent the greeting cards and blessings representing the hotel.In general, the service is good.Supplementary comment on August 10, 2008: I will recommend it to my friends."
1,我们定的行政大床房，装修很不错，就是床小了点，小孩子一起睡比较挤；还有窗的下面就是设备房，开窗后轰鸣声较大。酒店和携程的服务态度都很好，因为我和朋友衔接上的问题，预订修改了两次，他们都不厌其烦，非常感谢！,"The decoration of our administrative big bed room is very good, that is, the bed is a little smaller, and the children sleep together; there is a equipment room under the window, and the roar is loud after opening the window.The service attitude of the hotel and Ctrip is very good. Because of the problems on the connection between my friends and I, they were reserved twice. They were all annoying, thank you very much!"
1,"酒店的环境在济南算是一流的,但我住的日期,整个酒店的装修,所以环境感觉就不是太好.住的是一楼,房间比较大,设施老旧了一点,但总体上能接受的.","The environment of the hotel is first -class in Jinan, but the date of my living, the whole hotel's decoration, so the environment is not very good.

0,硬件设施还可以，服务很‘好’，一个晚上竟然打了好几个电话上来问需不需要小姐服务。。。。。。,"The hardware facilities are okay, the service is very 'good', and one night I called several phone calls to ask if the lady's service is needed.EssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssence"
1,"总体环境不错.这次入住的是超标准间,市内的两扇大落地窗不错,自然采光很好.早餐品种也还丰富.再加上酒店还免费赠送两听可口可乐,虽然没喝,但感觉还是很亲切.离市中心很近,步行就可到达,离夫子庙也就一个的士起步价.美中不足的是房间内没有落地镜.希望能得以改善.下次还会入住.房间价格已带早餐,这个的确很方便.补充点评2008年6月20日：酒店的大门太小,不显著.如果不熟悉路况的人不容易找到,非常容易把写字楼入口的大门弄成是酒店的大门.希望大门本身能得以改善,或者制作相应的路标牌.","The overall environment is good. This time I stayed in the super -standard room. The two large floor -to -ceiling windows in the city are good and natural lighting is very good. The breakfast variety is also rich. In addition, the hotel also gives free to two Coca -Cola.Still very kind. It is very close to the city center, and you can reach it by walking. The price of a taxi is just a taxi. The lack of the beauty is that there are no floor mirrors in the room. I hope to be improved. I will stay in the next time.Breakfast, this is indeed very convenient. Supplementary reviews June 20, 2008: The door of the hotel is too small to not significantly. If people who are not familiar with the road conditions are not easy to find, it is very easy to make the entrance of the office building into the door of the hotel. HopeThe gate itself can be improved, or the corresponding road signboard can be made."
0,超级的差，用信用卡预付房费时和结帐时，都是把信用卡扔出来的。房间又脏，而且订的并不是那种经济间，是商务间。房间还有蚊子，要电蚊片却没有机器。,"Super poor, with credit card prepaid time and checkout, all throw the credit card out of the checkout.The room is dirty, and it is not the kind of economy, but a business room.There are mosquitoes in the room, but there is no machine for electric mosquitoes."
1,"离景区近,住紫楼,房间一般,浴缸很干净,白天玩累了,泡澡很舒服,早餐太差","Near the scenic area, living in the purple building, the room is general, the bathtub is very clean, the bathtub is tired during the day, the bath is very comfortable, the breakfast is too bad"
0,实话说，此酒店有愧其大堂挂的四星的牌子。房间除了面积尚可外装修和内置相当一般，恐怕还达不到三星标准。只有一些房间有网络，虽然很先进的用wifi，但是信号非常弱。洗澡的时候发现没有沐浴液，服务员的工作态度十分马虎。,"To be honest, this hotel has the four -star brand hung by its lobby.In addition to the area of the room, the area can be decorated and built -in, I am afraid that it will not meet the Samsung standard.There are only some rooms with networks. Although they are very advanced using WIFI, the signal is very weak.When I was bathing, I found that there was no bath liquid, and the waiter's work attitude was very sloppy."
1,酒店的地理位置不错，就在西街的一头。房间设施还可以，在当地应该是比较好的。我们预定的观景大床房，能够看见西街上来来往往的游客。晚上由于西街上的餐馆生意较好，声音有点吵，但还不至于睡不着。总体来说，在阳朔当地应该是一家比较好的宾馆，老外也特别多。,"The hotel's geographical location is good, just on the end of West Street.The room facilities are okay, and it should be better locally.We booked a large -scale bedroom, we can see tourists who come up in West Street.In the evening, because the restaurant on the West Street is better, the sound is a bit noisy, but it can't sleep.In general, there should be a better hotel in Yangshuo, and there are many foreigners."
1,总体很不错，房间设计很合理，尤其是有漂亮的卫生间，上海的宾馆总是设计的很精致体贴，楼下的餐厅也很不错，够便宜用房卡还能打折哈哈，出门也很方便一点点路就是地铁什么的，附近也有些大排档什么的。。八错八错唯一不太理想的就是隔音啦，这似乎是很多宾馆的通病，还有就是我一朋友住在二楼，刚好正对厨房的某噪声发源地，伤心...,"The overall is very good. The design of the room is very reasonable, especially with beautiful bathrooms. The hotels in Shanghai are always designed to be very delicate and considerate. The restaurants downstairs are also very good.The point road is the subway or something, there are some stalls nearby.EssenceThe only thing that is not ideal for eight mistakes and eight mistakes is sound insulation. This seems to be a common problem in many hotels. There is also a friend who lives on the second floor."
1,"别墅型的酒店，非常特别,离海边很近.消费很平价","Villa -type hotels are very special, very close to the seaside. Consumption is very affordable"
1,软硬件设施都很好，房间很人性化，感觉很舒服。服务很到位。饭菜也很可口。下次会再入住。,"The software and hardware facilities are very good, the room is very humane, and it feels comfortable.The service is in place.The food is also very delicious.Will stay again next time."

1,位置非常好，就在西街的街口，但是却闹中取静，环境很清新优雅。只是前台太窄，前台接待总是手忙脚乱，客人都一排站着，大家都不排队，谁脸皮厚多叫就能给先办。入住和离住手续均办了半个小时以上。酒店房间还比较干净，没有中央空调，手动空调，呵呵。该酒店胜在环境和位置。,"The location is very good. It is at the street of West Street, but it is quiet and the environment is very fresh and elegant.It's just that the front desk is too narrow, and the front desk reception is always busy. The guests stand in a row. Everyone does not line up.Both the check -in and the procedures have been completed for more than half an hour.The hotel room is relatively clean, there is no central air conditioner, manual air conditioner, huh.The hotel wins in the environment and location."
1,出乎意料，大力推荐的一个酒店。游西海大峡谷的话，绝好的落脚处。我是第三次上黄山，山上潮湿我是知道的。看过本站帖子，已有心理准备。但此酒店房间一点潮湿感觉都没有。电暖器片工作良好（西门子的），房间足够暖和。记得以前来黄山（分别是十年前和二十三年前），也住过800多块的酒店，但被子中感觉似乎是可以拧出水的。我在南方生长过，对潮湿有一定的适应能力，但那时的山上的潮湿，还是让我几近不能接受。不过考虑到当地的环境，是情有可原的。不过这次LP（没怎么出过门的北方人）还是觉得床褥有点“潮”，不过也觉得很不错的。在我看来，所谓的“潮”只是南方天气造成的“凉”而已。北方人不太习惯。洗澡水很好。自带干粮没上馆子，所以对菜品菜价没得发言权了。前台男服务生也挺好的。虽然没有特别热情各感觉，但挺职业并且有问题的话也乐意给予解答。总之这次住宿免去“受潮”之苦，实为意外之喜。要知道，在走了那么多山路之后有个舒服的卧榻是多么幸福的事啊。强烈推荐。（注：当然请各位要上山的朋友们不要拿这里的房价跟其他地方相同房价的房子来比较，我觉得那样比的话就没什么意思了）,"Unexpectedly, a hotel that highly recommended.If you swim in the West Sea Grand Canyon, you will be a great place.I am going to Huangshan for the third time. I know the wet mountains.I have read the post on this site and are already mentally prepared.But there is no humidity in this hotel room.The electric heaters work well (Siemens), and the room is warm enough.I remember that I came to Huangshan (ten years ago and twenty -three years ago), and I also stayed in more than 800 hotels, but the quilt felt that it could be screwed out of water.I grew up in the south and had a certain ability to adapt to humidity, but the humidity on the mountain at that time still made me almost unacceptable.However, considering the local environment, it is emotional.However, this time LP (northerners who haven't been out of the door) still feel that the mattress is a bit ""tide"", but it also feels very good.In my opinion, the so -called ""tide"" is just the ""cold"" caused by the weather in the south.Northern people are not used to it.Bathing water is very good.There is no museum with dry food, so there is no right to speak for vegetables and vegetables.The front desk male waiter is also very good.Although there is no particularly enthusiastic feeling, if you have a career and have questions, you are willing to answer it.In short, this accommodation avoids the suffering of ""moisture"".You know, how happy it is after walking so many mountain roads.highly recommended.(Note: Of course, please do not take the house prices here to compare the house prices in the same place here. I think it is not interesting to compare it.)"
1,"6月和7月入住俩次豪华大床间,房间比较大,设施有点老了,环境不错，直接面对贺龙体育中心和摩天轮,早餐很一般,特别郁闷的是服务员，竟然在我们快要吃完的时候就打扫卫生,也不用差这么点时间吧,明显就是赶人啊","Two luxury beds in June and July, the rooms are relatively large, the facilities are a bit old, the environment is good, and it is very average to face the Helong Sports Center and Ferris Wheel.When you finish, clean it, don't have to have so much time. Obviously it is to catch people"
1,12月在金泉住了几天，开始订的豪华商务小套房，后来换了个商务标间，感觉性价比更好：两种房间大小差不太多，可以向酒店免费租一个猫，通过电源线上网，上网速度挺快。,"I stayed in Jinquan for a few days in December and started a small luxury business suites that I started to bind. Later, I changed a business standard room. It felt that the price / performance ratio was better: the two rooms were not much different in size. You can rent a cat for free from the hotel.On the Internet, the Internet speed is quite fast."
1,大堂挺宽敞的，房间里就一般了，倒是干干净净，床住得还算是舒服，洗手间挺紧凑的，价格没什么优势，不过在徐家汇这里，价格低的酒店不好找啊。跟旁边的建工锦江差不太多，交通还比较方便，离地铁大概走路15分钟的样子，如果天气好，可以去徐家汇公园散步。,"The lobby is very spacious, the room is average, but it is clean, the bed is comfortable, the bathroom is quite compact, and the price has no advantage. However, here in Xujiahui, the low -priced hotel is not easy to find.It is not much different from the construction of the construction workers next to it, and the transportation is relatively convenient. It is about 15 minutes away from the subway. If the weather is good, you can go to Xujiahui Park for a walk."
1,"我们是在2008年春节入住该酒店的.就这价格来说:总体感觉不错.但二次无法用门卡开门,最后麻烦服务员开的.他们的服务态度不错,这点值得表扬.卫生间小了点.如果再次回襄樊,金城仍是我们的首选(当然如他们不涨价的前提).最后希望他们可以送双早!谢谢!:)宾馆反馈2008年2月15日：您好！感谢您对金城大酒店的支持！您反映的问题客服部已记录，我们会在以后的工作中改善，谢谢！祝您春节愉快！","We stayed at the hotel in the Spring Festival in 2008.

The bathroom is smaller.Click. If you return to Xiangfan again, Jincheng is still our first choice (of course, if they do not increase the price). Finally, I hope they can send it to double morning! Thank you! :) Hotel feedback on February 15, 2008: Hello!Thank you for your support to Jincheng Hotel!The question department you reflect the customer service department has recorded, we will improve in future work, thank you!I wish you a happy Spring Festival!"
0,我感觉不行。。。性价比很差。不知道是银川都这样还是怎么的！,I don't feel it.EssenceEssenceThe price / performance ratio is very poor.I don't know if Yinchuan is like this or what!
1,房间挺小，不过香港的酒店几乎都是如此。前台服务很好，酒店地点也很好。周围是居民区，很安静。,"The room is quite small, but the hotels in Hong Kong are almost the same.The front desk service is good, and the hotel location is also very good.There are residential areas around, very quiet."
0,已经是第三次入住该酒店了，虽然换了一些新床和桌椅，但还是越来越久了．无论是服务还是其他，也就只有一星而已．只是在南戴河的话没办法了．,"It was the third time to stay in the hotel. Although I changed some new beds and tables and chairs, it was still getting longer and longer.Whether it is service or other, there is only one star.Just in Nan Daihe, there is no way."
0,该酒店主楼房间还不错，建议最好不要住附楼，房间质量和酒店四星级的标准差距太大了。强烈建议该酒店提高人员素质！！服务人员工作态度差，入住当晚半夜1点多居然发现房间空调漏水！！晕啊，当时因为是便宜房间，本来还不怎么生气，想说通知前台换房就好了，谁知道前台居然来一句“这么晚了不方便处理，又没什么关系的，您将就下好了”……结果偶当时就发飙了。虽然最后由于我们坚持还是换了房间，可是还是让人一肚子气！我出钱住店半夜不能睡觉要搬动我还没抱怨，她一个在值班时间的工作人员居然还要不情愿，真是不知道什么素质！！！！,"The hotel's main building room is not bad. It is recommended not to live in the affiliated building. The quality gap between the quality of the room and the standard of the four -star hotel in the hotel is too large.It is strongly recommended to improve the quality of personnel!IntersectionThe service staff's attitude was poor. At 1 o'clock in the evening of the night, I found that the room air conditioner leaked!IntersectionDizzy, because it was a cheap room at that time, I was not very angry. I wanted to notify the front desk to change the house. Who knows that the front desk is actually a sentence, ""It's not convenient to deal with it so late.""... As a result, I was soaring at the time.Although in the end, we still changed the room, but it was still angry!I ca n’t sleep in the middle of the night. I have n’t complained about it. I have n’t complained about it. She is reluctant to have a staff member on duty. I really do n’t know what quality!IntersectionIntersectionIntersection"
1,"今天刚从蝴蝶谷酒店回来,环境很好,很宁静舒服,是过两人世界的好地方!补充点评2008年2月24日：酒店的装修别具风格,其欠缺的就是客房的隔音不太理想.","I just returned from the Butterfly Valley Hotel today. The environment is very good, very quiet and comfortable. It is a good place to pass the two -person world! Supplementary comment February 24, 2008: The hotel's decoration is unique. What is lacking is that the sound insulation in the room is not veryideal."
0,设施老旧，服务员素质不高借个勺子都要押金借伞也要押金服务员整理房间把遥控器卷到了被子里，晕宾馆反馈2008年5月13日：感谢您的点评。您入住的商务普房（装修较早的房型），酒店前述点评回复有很多涉及的地方，您可看看；押金确实造成您的不便，根据您的意见，我们已经修正，今后不再收取客人类似押金；服务员流动性较大，如何保持服务水平的稳定我们将努力做好。期待您再次光临并留下宝贵意见。,"The facilities are old, and the quality of the waiter is not high. If you borrow a spoon, you have to deposit and borrow an umbrella. The waiter will organize the room to roll the remote control to the quilt. The halo hotel will give feedback on May 13, 2008: Thank you for your review.The commercial house you stayed in (the first room type of the decoration), the hotel's previous comments have a lot of involved places, you can see it; the deposit does cause your inconvenience. According to your opinion, we have correctedSimilar to deposit; the waiter is large, and we will work hard to maintain the stability of the service level.Looking forward to your visit and leaving valuable comments."
0,"一个晚上,要是能打死12个山蚊子,有生以来第一次.而且宾馆提供的电蚊香是不能使用的.后果是:房间由于客户打蚊子墙壁上血迹斑斑,非常恐怖.","One night, if you can kill 12 mountain mosquitoes for the first time in his life, and the electric mosquito coils provided by the hotel are unavailable. The consequences are: the room is very scary because the customer has blood on the wall of mosquitoes."
0,该酒店在大角湾景区内的顶角的位置（南方假日酒店则在角的另一端），对于没车的来说就很不方便了（出租、摩的非常少），远离市区，购物、娱乐都不方便，设施一般、没早餐，服务态度一般，不伦是旅游还是办事都不是好的选择，要是图安静的倒是比较适合，还有就是淡季不来就没什么人还要用信用卡作担保（感觉不怎么诚信）,"The hotel is located at the top corner of the Dagjiao Bay Scenic Area (the Southern Holiday Hotel is the other end of the corner). It is very inconvenient for those without a car (very few rental, the motorcycle).Entertainment is inconvenient, the facilities are average, there is no breakfast, and the service attitude is average. It is not a good choice for traveling or doing things. If the picture is quiet, it is more suitable.(I don't feel so honest)"
1,在四星级里面算是比较好的了，就是太偏远了。去市区要一个多小时。,"It is better in the four -star, but it is too remote.It takes more than an hour to go to the city."
1,这是第二次入住了，因为出差需要，在安庆，确实也没有其他地方可住，酒店整体环境优雅，房间设施一般，不过卫生还可以，每次入住后，习惯检查一下床面是否整洁，近期出差，入住的酒店中，只有这一家未发现床上有残留的头发等异物。,"This is the second time to stay. Because of the need for a business trip, in Anqing, there is no other place to stay. The overall environment of the hotel is elegant and the room facilities are average.Recently, there are only foreign objects such as residual hair on the bed in the hotel where there is no discovery in the hotel."
0,我去年的时候去过该酒店，那时候住的是无烟房，感觉还好，这回去住的是高级标准间，进去了房间就有一种怪味道要求前台换房，换过了以后还是多少有一点怪味。不过房间的墙壁特脏，后来想算了，就没在换，不过感觉今年的金鼎要比去年卫生环境差很多，装修也旧了！,"I went to the hotel last year. At that time, I lived in a smoke -free house. It felt okay. This is a high -level standard room when I go back. I have a strange flavor to change the house when I enter the room.A little strange.However, the walls of the room are very dirty. Later, I thought about it, but I didn't change it, but I felt that this year's Jin Ding was much worse than last year's sanitary environment, and the decoration was old!"
0,"酒店的星级与实际不符,房间相当与好一点的招待所,交通也不方便.住的不爽!","The hotel's star is not in line with the actual situation. The room is quite good with a better guest house, and the transportation is inconvenient. It is unhappy!"
0,按照预定的时间去住宿，携程却说我的订单取消了，对携程的信誉产生明显的怀疑。不是一个值得信任的网站补充点评2008年1月24日：给携程的800打电话，得到的却是一些冠冕堂皇的敷衍的话。,"I went to the accommodation at the scheduled time, but Ctrip said that my order was canceled, and it was clearly doubtful for Ctrip's reputation.It is not a trusted website to add comments on January 24, 2008: I called Ctrip's 800, but I got some grand and perfunctory words."
1,中餐厅的服务员有忽悠客人嫌疑，我们晚上9点到宾馆，上下跑了二回才找到中餐厅，我们一壶茶也没喝，也收了我们的茶费，更让人气愤的是，我们点的鳝鱼筒有异味，我们向服务员提出，她们态度很好，口头答应餐费减去，但到退房结账时，还是没有减去，因为我们要赶时间就没有和她们理论，但给我们留下的是她们的诚信不够。,"The waiter of the Chinese restaurant was suspected of flicker guests. We arrived at the hotel at 9pm at 9 pm and ran up and down for the second time to find the Chinese restaurant. We did not drink a pot of tea. We also charged our tea fee.The ordee's catfish tube has a odor. We raised to the waiters that they had a good attitude and agreed to subtract the meal fee with verbally, but it still did not subtract at the check -out.What we left is that their integrity is not enough."
0,很一般，服务态度不好，我走的时候有个密封的纸箱子需要帮忙拿下来，我先到前台结帐并找人帮忙拿下来，就在短短十分钟时间，查房的服务员擅自就把我密封的纸箱子拆开并翻看里面的东西，等和帮忙拿纸箱子的门童上去时，很气愤，质问服务员，服务员还振振有词，真是服了。不知道是不是有值钱东西就直接拿走了，幸好只是一些资料。,"Very general, the service attitude is not good. When I leave, there is a sealed carton that needs to help it. I go to the front desk to check out and find someone to help it. In just ten minutes, the waiter in the inspection room is unauthorized.When I disassembled the carton I sealed and looked at the inside, I was very angry when I went to the door child who helped get the carton, and asked the waiter.I do n’t know if there is something valuable. Fortunately, it ’s just some information."
1,住在阳光酒店，都不用上岛玩了，下次来一定带泳衣、吊竿,"Living in the Sunshine Hotel, you don’t need to go to the island to play. Next time, you must bring a swimsuit and hanging pole"
0,房间很冷且不隔音，服务一般，卫生间很小，房间整体舒适性在我住过的如家是最差的。,"The room is very cold and not soundproof, the service is average, the bathroom is small, the overall comfort of the room is the worst in Rujia I lived in."
1,在上海这样的城市，这个酒店性价比高，不错的选择，周围交通也算方便,"In cities like Shanghai, this hotel is cost -effective, good choices, and surrounding traffic is convenient"
1,在携程定的价格和直接到酒店前台给的价格是一样的，没有优势。,"The price set at Ctrip is the same as the price given directly at the front desk of the hotel, without advantages."
1,周边环境不好，虽然在五环边上，但交通也不十分便捷，初次去，恐怕不太好找。不过酒店本身还不错，挺新的，停车也很方便。由于只住了一晚，就匆匆离开了，对服务什么的，没太深切的感受。总体感觉还不错。,"The surrounding environment is not good. Although it is on the edge of the Fifth Ring Road, the transportation is not very convenient. I am afraid it is not easy to find for the first time.However, the hotel itself is pretty good, quite new, and it is very convenient to park.Because I only stayed for one night, I hurriedly left, and I didn't feel too deep about the service or something.feels pretty good in general."
1,没有早餐，酒店价格算是较贵的，房间设备比较陈旧。不过有个游泳池还不错！二楼的日式料理和巴西烤肉自助还不错！,"Without breakfast, the price of the hotel is more expensive, and the room equipment is old.But a swimming pool is not bad!Japanese cuisine on the second floor and Brazilian barbecue buffet are not bad!"
1,总的来说还可以，不过不知是否我比较幸运，拿到的房间电话线路有问题，用不了。钥匙卡又插不进那孔，搞到要把梳子插进去取电。泳池、羽毛球场等设施看来是时候保养或更新一下了。另外碰巧有会议召开，停车场也差不多满位了。,"Overall it, but I do n’t know if I am lucky. There are problems with the room phone line I got, and I do n’t need it.The key card cannot be inserted into that hole.Swimming pools, badminton courts and other facilities seem to be maintained or updated.In addition, the meeting happened to be held, and the parking lot was almost full."
1,"还可以,促销399,价钱不错.不过酒店躲在新工房后面,确实是一个疮疤","Okay, the promotion 399, the price is good. However, the hotel hides behind the new workshop, it is indeed a scarred scar"
1,"总体而言卫生尚佳!但不能自己烧水,不含早餐的房价显得偏高.地理位置还好.建议住客到酒店对面的一个早餐店去!","Overall, hygiene is still good! But you ca n’t burn water by yourself. House prices that do not include breakfast are high. The geographical location is okay. It is recommended that guests go to a breakfast shop across the hotel!"
1,刚刚入住过，喜欢山景房。尤其是酒店提供的散步路线图很让人喜欢。由于入住的是五号楼，离温泉稍远，正好赶上小雨，建议提供代步小车。宾馆反馈2008年4月14日：尊敬的客人，您好！我宾馆设有馆内交通车可免费接送至温泉会馆，建议您步行至温泉会馆，沿途欣赏红珠湖的美景。,"I just stayed in and liked the mountain view room.Especially the walking route map provided by the hotel is very popular.Because the No. 5 Building is staying, it is slightly far from the hot spring. It happens to catch up with the light rain. It is recommended to provide a mobility car.Hotel feedback on April 14, 2008: Dear guests, hello!Our hotel has a museum to pick up and drop it to the Hot Spring Club for free. It is recommended that you walk to the Hot Spring Club and enjoy the beautiful scenery of Hongzhu Lake along the way."
1,"房间比较一般,可能是去的晚了.盘锦的酒店普遍一般.周围环境还凑合,关键是离长途汽车站比较近,还是比较方便的,其他没有什么突出的地方.","The room is relatively average, and it may be late. Panjin's hotel is generally average. The surrounding environment is still together. The key is to be closer to the long -distance bus station, which is still convenient. Others have no prominent places."
0,"房间小得无法想象,建议个子大的不要选择,一般的睡觉脚也伸不直.房间不超过10平方,彩电是14寸的,晕死,交通还算方便,离地铁不行10分钟内,但你必须知道哪条是正确的路,如果入住,必须要有心理准备,一个字""小""!","The room is too small to imagine. It is recommended not to choose a big one. The general sleeping feet can not reach straight. The room does not exceed 10 square meters. The color TV is 14 inches.You must know which one is the right way. If you stay in, you must be mentally prepared. One word ""small""!"
0,"设施陈旧不堪,又小!灯光昏暗!早餐还可以!补充点评2008年6月5日：另外健身房早就没有了,希望携程信息应及时更新","The facilities are old and small! The light is dim! Breakfast is okay! Supplementary reviews June 5, 2008: In addition, the gym has long gone, I hope Ctrip information should be updated in time"
1,"我觉得此酒店在平湖还是比较好的,就是觉得单人间也应该是这个价格,这样对我们常年在平湖出差的来说更有吸引力.","I think this hotel is still better in Pinghu, that is, I think that the price of a single room should also be the price, which is more attractive to our business travel in Pinghu all year round."
1,酒店条件不错，如果一家人入住的话还是可以推荐的。交通还可以，吃饭不怎么方便，周围没什么小吃。不知奥运会的原因，反酒店前台服务热情，房间也比较干净，宽敞，舒适。下次一家人去北京，还是选择此酒店。,"The hotel conditions are good, if the family stays, it can be recommended.Transportation is okay, it is not very convenient to eat, there is no snack around.I do n’t know the reason for the Olympic Games. The front desk service of the anti -hotel is enthusiastic, and the room is relatively clean, spacious and comfortable.The next family go to Beijing and choose this hotel."
0,说实在的我很失望，之前看了其他人的点评后觉得还可以才去的，结果让我们大跌眼镜。我想这家酒店以后无论如何我都不会再去了。,"To be honest, I was disappointed. I felt that I could only go after watching the reviews of other people before, and the result was surprising.I think I won't go anyway in this hotel anyway."
1,酒店自动把房间升级成套房，不错，赞一下！但服务人员未免太自说自话，送水果也不能未经同意就自己开门进来啊！寒......希望加强培训！宾馆反馈2008年8月4日：非常感谢您的宝贵意见，我们将会在以后工作中加强此方面的相关培训。欢迎您的再次入住！,"The hotel automatically upgrade the room into a suite, yes, praise it!However, the service staff is too talking about it, and it is not necessary to give the fruit without opening the door without consent!Cold ... I hope to strengthen training!Hotel feedback on August 4, 2008: Thank you very much for your valuable opinions. We will strengthen related training in this area in the future.Welcome to stay again!"
1,服务非常好，环境也比较舒适，只是酒店的餐饮方面一般般。,"The service is very good and the environment is relatively comfortable, but the restaurant in the hotel is general."
1,９８年这家酒店开业时住过，感觉很好，今年去青岛还是选择了住在这里．１０年过去了，虽然硬件略显陈旧但服务水平依旧让我感觉很满意．,"I stayed at the hotel in 1998 and felt very good. I still chose to live here in Qingdao this year.10 years have passed, although the hardware is slightly old, but the level of service still makes me feel very satisfied."
1,房间太旧了，服务一般，倒是桑拿那里超级大有如对外经营的一样。地段还可以，其它就没有感觉了。,"The room is too old and the service is average, but the sauna is super as much as it is operating.The location is okay, there is no other feeling."
1,总台小姐凌晨0：30打电话询问房卡之事，惊扰本人美梦，使我一夜未眠，区区小事，为何不能次日早晨与我联系，服务欠周到，尚需改进,"Ms. Chief Taiwan called at 0:30 in the morning and asked the house card at 0:30 in the morning, disturbed my dream, and made me not sleep overnight. I couldn't contact me the next morning."
0,传说中当地最好的酒店，主观上的不说了，各人要求不同。三点非常不能让人接受！1、正对面就是火车头维修站（机务段），一整晚在呜呜呜……2、一晚来三个性骚扰电话！有个居然是三点，分别不同人打来的！3、酒店桑拿中心！根本就是那个……不说了！以后去内江！我宁愿坐车回自贡住！,"Legend has it that the best local hotels in the local area are not subjective, and each requires different requirements.Three points are very unacceptable!1. Opposite the locomotive maintenance station (machine section), overnight all night ... 2. Come to three sexual harassment calls in one night!One was actually three points, and different people came!3. Hotel sauna center!It's that ... don't say it!Go to Neijiang later!I would rather return from the car from Gong!"
1,"房间很大很干净,服务也很好,五星里面算很便宜的.下次还会来的.","The room is very large and clean, and the service is also very good. The five -star is very cheap. I will come next time."
1,"我昨天刚从承德回来,感觉盛华酒店的房间真的不错哦(除了楼道有些异味儿),可能因为是淡季的关系吧,客人不太多,但是服务很好。超赞的是，晚上叫的果盘，50元超级大、超级新鲜，去的亲们一定要试试哦。。。","I just came back from Chengde yesterday. I feel that the room of Shenghua Hotel is really good (except for the smell of the corridor). It may be because it is a off -season. There are not many guests, but the service is good.The superbly, the fruit plate called at night, 50 yuan is super large and super fresh, those who go to go must try it.EssenceEssence"
1,4月25日入住的，订了两间，酒店很别致，房间也新，服务态度也非常好就在西溪公园后面，空气好，鸟语花香的。由于通过携程订的，每间房送张西溪湿地公园的门票，我不小心把票弄丢了，和经理讲了后，他人很好心地带我们去公园买票，全都打了对折，还有船票也打了对折。适合自驾车游，到西湖也很方便，沿着天目山路朝东北方向开，过了个中石化的加油站右转过隧道就是灵隐寺了。下面再说说不太满意的地方：就是隔音效果不太好，尤其是一幢房子里住不同的人，我们订了两间都是在一楼的，二楼被一伙人包了，他们在二楼的过道里打牌打到很晚，很吵人。而且抽水马桶的声音听得很清楚，由于每幢楼都有总门的，每次有人进出，门自动关起的声音很响。餐厅的小菜还行，就是我们五点半天还亮着去点菜，服务员居然告诉我说土鸡卖光了，难道只有中午才能吃到吗？个人总的来说觉得，这个价格还是挺合理的，虽然不在西湖边，可是这旁边的湿地公园环境和风景绝对不比西湖差，而且人少、安静。适合度假，周边没什么购物点。,"I stayed on April 25 and booked two rooms. The hotel was very chic, the room was new, and the service attitude was very good. It was behind Xixi Park. The air was good and the birds were fragrant.Due to the booking through Ctrip, each room was sent to the Zhangxixi Wetland Park ticket, and I accidentally lost the ticket. After telling the manager, others carefully went to the park to buy tickets.The ticket was also folded.Suitable for self -driving tour, it is also very convenient to go to West Lake. It is driving along the northeast of Tianmu Mountain Road. After turning the tunnel on the right of Sinopec's gas station, it is Lingyin Temple.Let ’s talk about the place that is not very satisfied: that is, the sound insulation effect is not very good, especially in a house in a house. We have ordered two rooms on the first floor.The aisle on the second floor was very late, and it was very noisy.Moreover, the sound of the toilet was clearly heard. Because each building had the main door. Every time someone entered and leaving, the sound of the door automatically closed was very loud.The side dishes in the restaurant are okay, that is, we are still lit up for me at 5:30. The waiter actually told me that the chickens were selling light. Can it only be eaten at noon?In general, I feel that the price is quite reasonable. Although it is not by the West Lake, the environment and landscape of the wetland park next to this are definitely not worse than the West Lake, and there are fewer people and quiet.Suitable for vacation, there is no shopping point around."
1,酒店靠近火车站，交通还算方便。软件方面酒店人员的服务态度不错，任何事情都及时回复。硬件方面优点是房间比较宽敞，设施还可以，洗澡水也非常大，这一点很舒服。唯一的缺点就是卫生间稍微小了点。总体来件性价比不错的一家酒店，以后还会入住。,"The hotel is close to the railway station, and the traffic is quite convenient.The service attitude of hotel staff in the software is good, and everything is replied in time.The advantage of the hardware is that the room is relatively spacious, the facilities are okay, and the bath water is very large, which is very comfortable.The only disadvantage is that the bathroom is slightly smaller.A hotel with a good cost -effective overall piece will stay in the future."
1,"8月初去的,政府招待所性质,所以服务可想而知,不过邯郸实在没什麽地方值得落脚,凑合着去住了.房间刚装修完,气味浓重,开窗户纱窗不严,怕进蚊子,不开实在熏得慌,熬了一夜落荒而逃..","I went to the early August, the government's hospitality house, so the service can be imagined, but there is no place in Handan that it is worth settlement. It is just for living. The room is just finished, the smell is strong, and the window screen is not strict.It was really panicked, and fled overnight .."
0,水笼头没坏，但是破到你无法想象，水流很细。刚入住发现房间还有上一位客人的东西。服务员打扫房间后，大晚上又来敲门，说是自己的东西拉房间了。讲话还很大声，房间又临街，吵的要死。补充点评2007年11月26日：登记时刷卡，结果不是预授权，直接刷消费，可钱的数目还是押金数额不是实际住店金额。结帐走人时，前台拿着我的卡东刷西刷上刷下刷，10分钟后告诉我不是这张卡。我说我的卡和我的记性没问题，你让领班弄。又过了十分钟，领班来搞定了。酒店硬件不行，服务软件也差死了。,"The water cage is not bad, but you can't imagine it, the water flow is very thin.I just stayed in the room and found that there was something of the last guest.After the waiter cleaned the room, he knocked on the door again at night, saying that his own thing was pulling the room.The speech was still loud, the room was near the street, and the noisy was going to die.Supplementary comment on November 26, 2007: Swipe the card when registering, the result is not pre -authorized, and the consumption is directly swiped. The amount of money is not the actual amount of deposit.When leaving at the checkout, the front desk took my Kadong to brush it to the west brush and brushed it down. After 10 minutes, I told me that it was not this card.I said that my card and my memory is okay, you let the foreman make it.Ten minutes later, the foreman came to get it.The hotel's hardware is not good, and the service software is bad."
1,因为未婚夫在美国的关系，他经常要美国、中国两边跑，每次都选择过境香港，所以给了我最好的理由去香港。在香港入住过不同的酒店，这家酒店给我的感觉最好。服务和环境都没有话可说，最感动的是，退房时走得匆忙，一条新买的裙子给忘在酒店房间了，直到回到家收拾行李才发现裙子不见了，当时已经是凌晨2点了，我抱着试试看的心态给酒店去了电话，结果接电话的男士很礼貌的告诉我裙子他们有收到。谢天谢地，经过沟通，以信用卡作邮费支付担保，我的裙子终于在失散一周之后回到了我的身边。下次未婚夫回国，我会强烈推荐他入住这家酒店，我想我以后去香港都会入住这家酒店,"Because the fiance's relationship in the United States, he often wants to run in the United States and China, and choose to transit Hong Kong every time, so I gave me the best reason to Hong Kong.I have been in different hotels in Hong Kong, and this hotel feels the best.Neither the service and the environment can be said. The most moved is that they hurried when checking out. A newly bought skirt was forgotten in the hotel room. It was not until I returned home to clean up the luggage.I went to the hotel with the mentality of trying to try. As a result, the man who answered the phone told me that they received the skirts.Thanks, after communicating, I paid the guarantee with a credit card for postage, and my skirt finally returned to my side after a week.The next time my fiance returns to China, I will strongly recommend him to stay in this hotel. I think I will stay in this hotel in Hong Kong in the future"
1,酒店硬件、服务均不错，总体挺满意。不足处：食街的菜式及早餐品种不够丰富。,"The hotel's hardware and services are good, and they are generally very satisfied.Insufficient: The dishes of food streets are not rich enough."
1,这是最好的酒店之一了，曾经住过的。它有其他酒店缺少的古朴环境，占地又特大！古典和现代的优雅结合！安静的房间，是因为掩映在了古树林中。很棒的感觉！有机会就回去的。,"This is one of the best hotels and has lived.It has the simplicity environment that other hotels lack, occupying the same area and great!The combination of classical and modern elegance!The quiet room is because it is hidden in the ancient forest.Great feeling!Go back if you have a chance."
0,"挺一般的酒店,酒店门口的马路挺吵的,性价比不高,不值得推荐","Quite hotel, the road at the entrance of the hotel is quite noisy, the cost performance is not high, it is not worth recommending"
1,"通过携程预定,我们在友好度过了一个愉快的周末!携程不错,友好更好!特别感谢梁思小姐热情,周到的服务.还为我们制定了合理的游玩路线,使我们玩的很尽兴!谢谢了!另外,前台和门童也很专业,友好.让人很舒服!下次,还住友好!宾馆反馈2008年8月6日：非常感谢您能选择入住我们饭店，为宾客提供热情、周到的服务是我们饭店一贯的宗旨，我们也在饭店的每个岗位积极推行“满意加惊喜“的金钥匙服务理念。您对我们员工的赞许和肯定是对我们工作的最大鼓励。衷心期待您的下次光临。","Through Ctrip's booking, we have spent a pleasant weekend in friendship!

1,尽管外观一般，大堂一般，房间硬件却是绝对一流的。订的是418元一房一厅带桑拿的房间，是至今为止所住国内性价比最高的房间，比很多五星酒店更大更豪华和更舒服，商务之星的经营和管理确实有一套，一楼的自助海鲜晚餐才48，比广州68元的怡景西餐厅还好，服务、环境和食物都是超值的，推荐。早餐品种较少，酒店周围环境较差，后面有超市，还有一家湛江风味一家湖南风味食肆，地下停车场奇差，服务生和门童服务较差跟酒店内的服务天差地别，整个酒店都在说普通话，呵呵，广州人有点不适应。补充点评2008年2月25日：418的房间有68平米，一房一厅双电视（要是液晶就好了，呵呵），超大浴室双人浴缸大淋浴房带双人桑拿房，2x2大床，房间日送4瓶水，一家三口去的，加被子毛巾浴袍浴巾要多少有多少，拿来还是暖的，到处都有很到位的服务，宵夜送餐那是相当的便宜，周3、4、5、6凭房卡下午茶免费，有水果蛋糕点心茶和咖啡,"Although the appearance is average, the lobby is average, the room hardware is absolutely first -class.The room with a 418 yuan one -bedroom and one -living room is booked. It is the highest cost -effective room that has lived so far. It is larger and more luxurious and more comfortable than many five -star hotels.The buffet seafood dinner is only 48, which is better than the Yijing West Restaurant 68 yuan in Guangzhou. The service, environment and food are great value. It is recommended.There are fewer breakfast varieties, poor surroundings around the hotel, there are supermarkets in the back, and a Zhanjiang flavor of Hunan flavor restaurants. The underground parking lot is poor.The entire hotel is speaking Mandarin, haha, Guangzhou people are a bit uncomfortable.Supplementary comment February 25, 2008: The room of 418 is 68 square meters, one room, one living room and double TV (if the LCD is fine, ha ha), the large bathroom double bathroom big shower room with double sauna, 2x2 bed, room day dayGive 4 bottles of water, the family of three goes, and how much is the bathrobe bathrobe bathing in a napkin, and it is still warm. There are very good services everywhere.5, 6 free afternoon tea for the house card, fruit cake snack tea and coffee"
0,不好，服务员像目老虎，态度极其恶劣，当然就这个价钱设施还是可以的,"Not good, the waiter looks like a tiger, and the attitude is extremely bad. Of course"
0,根本不是酒店，不是人住的，房间加洗手间一共就6个平方，走路的地方都没有，而且卫生设施非常差，电视机小的看不到，加起来才3频道，简直就是难民营！！强烈建议大家不要图便宜住这家酒店！！,"It is not a hotel at all, not people live. There are 6 square meters in the room with the bathroom. There are no places to walk, and the sanitary facilities are very poor. The TV is small.IntersectionIt is strongly recommended that you do not live in this hotel cheaply!Intersection"
0,五一期间，“好心的酒店”居然送我们早餐，但是一个房间只送一份。结果，就是，我们五个房间9个人，只有五个人有早餐，其他4个每人要多付98元一份早餐。我们想把4号的早餐改成2号也不行（我们四号的早上的飞机，早餐６点开始，我们５点要出门）。太不人性化了。其中一个房间居然浴室没有帘子。。。。。。。。。。。,"During the May Day, the ""Good Hotel"" actually gave us breakfast, but there was only one room.As a result, there are nine people in our five rooms, only five people have breakfast, and the other 4 have to pay 98 yuan an additional breakfast.We want to change the No. 4 breakfast to No. 2 (the morning plane on the 4th of our No. 4, starting at 6 o'clock, we will go out at 5 o'clock).Too humane.One of the rooms had no curtains in the bathroom.EssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssence"
1,环境不错，设施也很齐全，价格能优惠点就更好了,"The environment is good, the facilities are also complete, and the price is preferentially better."
0,来到拉萨才发觉这家饭店的价格的确是偏高，同样水准的饭店在北京路上都只需200元以下。最大的问题是环境杂吵，睡不好。,"When I came to Lhasa, I found that the price of this restaurant was indeed high. The same standard restaurants only needed less than 200 yuan on Beijing Road.The biggest problem is that the environment is noisy and can't sleep well."
1,总体来说还可以，门口的车不是很多，但是金门路上车很多，游5等都可以直接到火车站，离寒山寺留园虎丘定园都很近！,"Generally speaking, there are not many cars at the door, but there are a lot of cars on the Golden Gate Road. You can go directly to the railway station. It is very close to the Tiger Hill Dingyuan away from Hanshan Temple!"
0,非常一般的酒店，房里设施很旧，房间送餐竟然要加多50%的送餐费。总之找不到好的方面来说，有其他选择就不要去了,"Very ordinary hotels, the facilities in the room are very old, and the room delivery costs 50%of the food delivery fee.In short, if you can't find a good aspect, don't go if you have any other choices"
1,"非常物有所值,入住后房间内很舒适,只是周围环境嘈杂,前台服务小姐非常热情.","It is very worthwhile. After check -in, the room is very comfortable, but the surrounding environment is noisy. The front desk service lady is very enthusiastic."
1,是香格里拉规格最高、设施最完备的酒店，当然放假也了得。,"It is the hotel with the highest specifications and the most complete facilities in Shangri -La. Of course, holidays are also good."
0,"酒店服务不太好,咖啡厅的餐饮非常茶(品种少,样式老)酒店隔音效果非常不好.第一天住的房间隔壁人说话好象就在房间中,换房后在走廊上的说话听的非常清楚.我打电话都只好躲到洗手间,反正太没有隐私了.酒店设施比较陈旧,在快速路边,外出不方便.携城价格是620NET(不含早),我朋友通过旅行社是610(含早),所谓的500元只是第一天的价格,很有欺骗性.","The hotel service is not very good. The catering in the cafe is very tea (small variety, old style) The sound insulation effect of the hotel is very bad.I listened very clearly. I had to hide in the bathroom when I called. Anyway, there was no privacy anyway. The hotel facilities were relatively old. On the side of the fast road, it was inconvenient to go out. The price of the city was 620NET (excluding early).610 (including Early), the so -called 500 yuan is only the price of the first day, and it is very deceived."
1,房间虽然小但还是可以接受的，里面设施齐全，唯一给我的感觉是房间里都是镜子，老婆洗澡可以从各个角度看到，爽啊。唯一不好的就是交通不方便，我们每天在酒店门口乘小巴到九龙城才能换到地铁（价钱是4.7元），小巴11点多就没有了。行李可以免费寄存，不过要锁好。,"Although the room is small, it is still acceptable. The facilities are complete. The only feeling to me is that the room is mirror. My wife can see from all angles, cool.The only bad thing is that the transportation is inconvenient. We can take the minibus to Kowloon City at the entrance of the hotel to the subway (the price is 4.7 yuan) every day (the price is 4.7 yuan).Luggage can be stored for free, but it is locking."
1,价格比比较不错的酒店。这次免费升级了，感谢前台服务员。房子还好，地毯是新的，比上次的好些。早餐的人很多要早去些。,"Hotel ratio is relatively good.This time I upgraded for free, thanks to the front desk waiter.The house is okay, the carpet is new, better than the last time.Many people with breakfast have to go early."
1,基本和大家的评论一样，交通比较方便，去上下九地铁站都很方便，广州的地铁站标示太不明显了。坐地铁出行很方便，不过由于地铁站在沙面的一边而宾馆在另一边所以每次要在沙面里面走挺长一截。不过路上大树很多走起来也挺不错。房间的卫生间很大，老婆比较满意。有冰箱夏天去很方便。由于没带笔记本网络没有用。唯一的问题就是由于在沙面水果还有一些小的日用品购买起来不方便。要买水果必须到街对面去，而沙面只有两边有桥能过去，要走好远。建议出去逛街回来的路上就买好水果。另外在沙面照婚纱和模特取景的真的挺多的呵呵,"Basically, like everyone's comments, transportation is more convenient. It is convenient to go to the upper and lower nine subway stations. The labeling of the subway station in Guangzhou is too obvious.It is very convenient to travel by subway, but because the subway stands on one side of the sand, the hotel is on the other side, so it takes a long time on the sand.But a lot of big trees on the road are also pretty good.The bathroom in the room is very large, and his wife is more satisfied.It is convenient to go in summer in the refrigerator.It is useless because it does not bring a notebook network.The only problem is that there are some small daily necessities on sandy fruits that are inconvenient to buy.To buy fruits, you must go across the street, and there are only bridges on both sides of the sand to pass, and you have to go far.It is recommended to buy fruit on the way out to go shopping.In addition, there are really a lot of scenes in the wedding dress and models in Shamian."
1,位置确实很不错，但是房价还是太贵，一点竞争力也没有。房间的隔音确实不太好，外面的说话声听得相当的清楚。房间设施比较陈旧但是比较干净，这一点还是不错的。如果能够再便宜一些就好了,"The location is really good, but house prices are still too expensive, and there is no competitiveness at all.The sound insulation in the room is really not very good, and the voice outside hears it clearly.The room facilities are relatively old but clean, which is still good.If it can be cheaper, it would be better"
1,吃早餐的地方特别拥挤退房的时候N慢性价比低，还不如新装修过的国贸,"When you eat breakfast, you are particularly crowded and check -out. The chronic cost performance is low."
1,"酒店硬件一般,这么偏远的地方有这样也不错了.不过环境太棒了.海拔830米,凉快.有个大游泳池,水山泉水的,有些凉.不过自然啊,没有消毒剂..山下319国道到茶园15分钟车程..茶园餐厅手艺不错,价格也不算贵房间有小阳台,外面就是茫茫的森林..感觉太好了..避暑渡假的好去处..最好住顶楼四楼,视野绝佳..不小心说太多了,搞得自己象个托似的..哈哈....","The hotel's hardware is average. It is also good to have such a remote place. However, the environment is great. The altitude is 830 meters, cool. There is a big swimming pool, water mountain spring water, a little cold. But natural, there is no disinfection agent.National Highway to Tea Garden 15 -minute drive .. Tea Garden Restaurant has good craftsmanship, and the price is not a small balcony in your room, and the outside is the vast forest .. It feels great .., I have a great vision .. I accidentally say too much, so I like myself .. Haha ...."
0,酒店还不算难找，地铁出来走不远就到！本来公干出差，想着为公司省点钱吧，挑了个北京目前比较便宜的酒店。看了网上的点评对酒店的期望还比较高，但是入住以后却很失望。房间的设施姑且不谈，首先服务就不令人满意，前台冷冰冰的，晚上想找个地方吃饭（因为厨房没有晚饭了），但是说了半天也没说清楚，害的我在旁边兜了一大圈，最后还是吃了方便面。这些都还可以忍受，最最郁闷的是，晚上想洗个热水澡好好休息，结果，水不但不热，水还很小。没办法，只能换酒店了。希望能尽快改进！光是价格有优势那也是做不长的。,"The hotel is not difficult to find, and the subway is not far away!Originally, the public business was on a business trip, thinking about saving the company for the company, and picked a hotel that is currently cheaper in Beijing.After watching the online reviews, the expectations of the hotel are relatively high, but they are disappointed after check -in.If you do n’t talk about the facilities in the room, the service is not satisfactory first. The front desk is cold. I want to find a place to dinner at night (because the kitchen has no dinner), but I did n’t make it clear for a long time.Large circle, finally ate instant noodles.These can still endure. The most depressed thing is that you want to take a hot bath at night to take a good rest. As a result, the water is not only hot, but also the water is very small.No way, you can only change the hotel.Hope to improve as soon as possible!The price alone has an advantage, and it is not long."
0,与其他如家比，这家隔音效果出奇差，不知道是不是我房间的问题，隔壁的说话声，电视声，厕所冲水声，床上的嘿哟嘿哟声都能听到；另外退房时说房间毛巾脏了，要赔15元，买一条毛巾也就5元，怎么要赔15元？毛巾脏了就要赔，那以后谁还敢用你家毛巾？如家住了五六家店，感觉这是最差的一家。,"Compared with other Jiajia, this sound insulation effect is strange. I do n’t know if it is the problem in my room.It is said that the room towels are dirty, and you have to pay 15 yuan, and you can buy a towel 5 yuan. How can you pay 15 yuan?If the towel is dirty, you will lose it. Who dares to use your towels in the future?Rujia lived in five or six stores and felt that this was the worst one."
0,"总体感觉很不好.酒店实际就是一个公寓短租房形式的.藏在一个公寓里的一层.不是很好找.房间的味道很重,感觉脏西西的。估计是卫生人员不勤于打扫.看的出来，酒店想模仿些情人酒店的感觉和商务酒店的简单.不过两个都学的不像.细节做的太差了",Overall feels very bad. The hotel is actually a short -term rental house in an apartment. The layer hidden in an apartment. It is not very easy to find. The taste of the room is very heavy and feels dirty.It is estimated that the health staff is not diligent in cleaning. It can be seen that the hotel wants to imitate the feelings of some lover hotels and the simple business hotel.
0,用信用卡付房费时居然要收2%的手续费。后来结账时却没有收手续费，不知道为什么？真是晕啊。酒店设施一般。另外，附近有卡拉OK，很吵，一直闹到半夜里。外面吃饭的地方很多，这点很方便。,"When paying a house with a credit card, it costs 2%of the fee.Later, there was no handling fee at the checkout. I don't know why?Really dizzy.Hotel facilities are average.In addition, there is karaoke nearby, very noisy, all the time in the middle of the night.There are many places to eat outside, which is very convenient."
0,订的是288的标房，房间相当小，设施简单，卫生间连转身都感觉相当困难，前台的服务态度也很差，退房时足足等了十多分钟，不推荐大家入住。,"The 288 standard room is booked. The room is quite small, the facilities are simple, and the bathroom feels very difficult to turn around. The service attitude of the front desk is also very poor. After checking out, it has been waiting for more than ten minutes. It is not recommended to stay in."
1,房间之间的隔音实在有点不敢恭维，灯光基本是使用小射灯，既浪费电又没办法完全照亮整个房间！,"The sound insulation between the rooms is a bit dare to compliment. The lights are basically using a small spotlight, which is a waste of electricity and no way to completely illuminate the entire room!"
1,"住的是豪华单人房,房间很大,但是空调明显不足,冷死了补充点评2008年1月25日：还有,房间灯光昏暗.","I live in a luxurious single room. The room is large, but the air conditioner is obviously insufficient. The replenishment comments on January 25, 2008: Also, the room lights are dim."
1,地理位置不错，酒店内装修风格和设施一般，早餐不错，服务好。,"The geographical location is good, the hotel's decoration style and facilities are average, the breakfast is good, and the service is good."
1,酒店的服务是不错的，但是硬件不够五星标准，什么都要再收费。晚上的自助餐很值，酒店去市中心的巴士也很方面。如果在住上不想花太多的钱，可以考虑！,"The hotel's service is good, but the hardware is not enough for five -star standards, and everything needs to be charged.The buffet at night is very worthy, and the hotel's bus to the city center is also very effective.If you don't want to spend too much money on your living, you can consider it!"
0,隔音太差，好像开着窗户一样。吵的没法睡。再出差不敢住这里了房间设施还可以，床上被褥很干净,"The sound insulation is too bad, as if there are windows.Noisy to sleep.I don’t dare to live again. The room facilities are okay. The bedding on the bed is very clean."
1,海景房还是挺不错的，挺大的，也能看到海。服务就不知道了，只住了一晚上。下次有机会还住那里，多住几天。,"The sea view room is still very good, very big, you can also see the sea.I do n’t know the service, I only lived for one night.I have a chance to live there next time, and live for a few more days."
1,服务细节比一年半前有提高，也像济南舜和那样赠送了小毛绒玩具。并且晚上赠送了一份水果。早餐内容还是略显不足，比附近的新悦还要差一些。价格比新悦贵100元，还算物有所值吧。,"The service details have been improved compared to the year and a half ago, and they also presented small plush toys like Jinan Shunhe.And a fruit was given away at night.Breakfast content is still slightly insufficient, worse than nearby Xinyue.The price is 100 yuan than Xinyuegui, it is worth it."
1,入住西楼海景套房（据说离海更近一点），应该说总体很不错，有老五星的风范。服务也比较热情。可能是比较老或是空调或是近海的原因，房间内稍有一点异味。地毯厚度不够5星的。家具大都是原色的，地毯也是颜色的，不亮丽。电视陈旧，遥控器不灵了。比较好玩的是房间里的电水壶的大个头，好像还是进口的。还有早餐分中西常规、粤式(我倾向于这个)和日式的3个厅，不过只能选择其中一个，到10点结束。走廊是分片的感应灯。有夜床服务、午茶小饼干1块、枕头上会放一张别着小鲜花的印有诗句的卡纸，赞！洁具质量不好，除了肥皂。无烟楼层有客人在走廊和房间(房门洞开)抽烟，无人制止。缺少报纸供应。盥洗室放有女孩子可应急的发筋，细心，再赞一个。套房的景色很不错，离海倒是确实近，就在背后。稍微偏离一点商业区，不过不远，打车到五四广场3公里不到。补充点评2008年3月6日：差点忘了，我打车的司机径直把握开到东楼，拉门的先生还给我一张记录有车牌号的纸片，赞一下。另外，青岛的酒店服务普遍不错。不过饭店的服务员可能没听说过“菊花普洱”。,"Check in the West Building Sea -view suite (it is said that it is closer to the sea), it should be said that the overall is very good, with the style of the old and five stars.The service is also more enthusiastic.It may be the reason for the old or air conditioner or offshore, and a little odor in the room.The thickness of the carpet is not enough for 5 stars.Most of the furniture is primary, and the carpet is also color, not bright.The TV is old, and the remote control is not spiritual.The more fun is the big head of the electric kettle in the room, which seems to be imported.There are also three halls of Chinese and Western routines, Cantonese -style (I tend to this) and Japanese style, but only one of them can be selected, and it ends at 10 o'clock.The corridor is a piece of sensor lamp.There will be a night bed service, one piece of lunch tea biscuits, and a cardboard with poems printed with small flowers on the pillow, praise!The quality of the sanitary ware is not good, except for soap.There are guests from smoke -free floors to smoke in the corridor and room (open door), and no one is stopped.Lack of newspaper supply.There are girls' emergency hairs, carefully, and praise one again.The scenery of the suite is very good, it is really close to the sea, just behind.Slightly deviated from a little business district, but not far away, less than 3 kilometers to May 4th Plaza.Supplementary comment on March 6, 2008: I almost forgot that the driver of my taxi took the driver to the East Tower. The gentleman of the sliding door also gave me a piece of paper with a license plate number, and praised it.In addition, Qingdao's hotel services are generally good.However, the waiter at the hotel may not have heard of ""chrysanthemum Pu'er""."
1,很好的酒店，以它的房价，在香港可算物超所值。别无他选。,"A good hotel, with its house prices, can be worthy of money in Hong Kong.No other choice."
1,环境幽雅，房间卫生，空气清新，服务好，安全！！饮食比较好，价位公道，比那些路边店好的多！！,"Elegant environment, hygiene in the room, fresh air, good service, safe!IntersectionThe diet is better and the price is fair, which is much better than those roadside shops!Intersection"
1,"周围环境很好,装修舒适,房间干净隔音不好,隔壁打呼噜就不要想睡觉了服务素质急待提高","The surrounding environment is very good, the decoration is comfortable, and the room is clean and sound insufficient. Don't want to sleep next door to snoring."
0,极差！停车收十元钱！穷则思变！房间招待所、服务员优越感极强！,Extremely bad!Parking ten yuan!Poor thinking changes!The room guest house and waiter have a strong sense of superiority!
0,22日预订的7楼江景豪华套间，入住后才知江景需要打开房门通过楼梯通道到公共凉台上才能看到江景，最可恶的是卧室的床居然与公共通道仅有一面玻璃窗之隔（有窗帘），看不到江景不说，楼道人来人往走路的声音到很清晰。到前台要求换房，小姐说没有，无奈要求退房，小姐又说6楼有1间，又上6楼却是标间，又要求退房，小姐说5楼有1间，又上5楼，这回真是江景套房宽大舒适，直接入住。洗澡时发现淋浴间奇小，转身都费力，而且水居然忽冷忽热，无奈忍一宿，早上结帐走人。这是什么破酒店，还四星，连2星都不如。,"On the 22nd, the seventh floor of the Jiangjing luxury suite, after checking in, I realized that Jiang Jing needs to open the door to see Jiang Jing through the stairs passage to the public cool platform.The separation (with curtains), no one can see Jiang Jing, the sound of people walking and walking is very clear.When I went to the front desk, I asked to change the house. The lady said no, but I was helplessly asked to check out. The lady also said that there was one room on the 6th floor, but the 6th floor was a standard room.This time it is really a large and comfortable Jiangjing suite, and stay directly.When I took a bath, I found that the shower room was small, and the turning was laborious, and the water was cold and hot.What is this broken hotel? There are four stars, not even 2 stars."
0,"房间一般，真的很一般。没有早餐。还是个办公楼，人很杂。宾馆反馈2008年4月25日：房间视个人喜好而定,可能您不喜欢我们的客房类型,关于办公楼,我们大厦办公房间所占比例很小,还不到10%,希望您给予谅解和支持!","The room is average, it is really average.No breakfast.Still a office building, people are very mixed.Hotel feedback on April 25, 2008: The room depends on personal preferences.

0,邯郸地区基本没有一家好宾馆。说实话，这也庭难为携程了！就这么几家：邯郸宾馆、邯郸大酒店、迎宾国际。但都很不好。还都乱收费！死贵！,"There are basically no good hotels in Handan.To be honest, this is also difficult for Ctrip!Just a few: Handan Hotel, Handan Hotel, Yingbin International.But they are all bad.Also charged!Dead!"
1,当时由于原先预定的标准间没有房间，酒店人员免费将2个房间全部升级到行政间，前台服务人员态度非常好，对了我强烈推荐大家去顶楼的旋转自助餐厅，那里的环境很灵的。,"At that time, there was no room in the original standard room, and the hotel staff upgraded all the two rooms to the administrative room for free. The front desk service staff attitude was very good. By the way, I strongly recommended that everyone went to the rotating buffet restaurant on the top floor, where the environment was very spiritual."
1,酒店有一面的房间对着墓地，定深圳出发的香港自由行特惠套餐给安排的房间都是靠墓地一边的，介意的朋友，建议不要选择这家酒店，或者订豪华房。,"The hotel has a room facing the cemetery, and the rooms arranged by the Hong Kong Free Xingxing Special Metro Set for Hong Kong are on the side of the cemetery. Friends who mind, it is recommended not to choose this hotel or order a luxury room."
0,堂堂四星级酒店，写错了房号。用户按照订单退的房间，给携程反馈的是提前退房。这种服务能符合四星级吗？,"The four -star hotel, the wrong room number was written.If the user retires according to the order, the Ctrip will give away the check -out.Can this service conform to the four -star?"
1,房间设施不错，用具配备齐全，超四星！康师傅的红烧牛肉面才6元，就懒得出去买，当夜宵享用了。地理位置稍偏，适合自驾游；横店不大，开到景区也就5、6分钟。补充点评2007年7月2日：自助早餐不错，还有烤土司，很香！,"The room facilities are good, the equipment is complete, super four -star!Master Kang's braised beef noodles was only 6 yuan, so he was too lazy to go out to buy it and enjoy it in supper.The geographical location is slightly discouraged, suitable for self -driving tour; the Hengdian is not large, and it will be 5 or 6 minutes to open the scenic area.Supplementary comment on July 2, 2007: The buffet breakfast is good, and there are baked soil, it is very fragrant!"
1,是个弱四星酒店，各方面比较均衡，旅游商务皆可考虑。若要挑刺的话有以下几点：一、价格是否能更优惠些，四百多的标房价格稍高了些。二、入口不是特别方便醒目。三、就四星而言，大堂稍微寒碜了点。友情提醒：国信大酒店位于两站地铁中间，行李多或天气差时，不要坐地铁前往。,"It is a weak four -star hotel, which is relatively balanced in all aspects and can be considered for tourism business.If you want to pick up, there are the following points: 1. Whether the price can be more favorable, and the price of more than 400 standard houses is slightly higher.Second, the entrance is not particularly convenient.3. As far as four stars are concerned, the lobby is a little bit cold.Friendly reminder: Guoxin Hotel is located in the middle of the two subways. When the luggage is large or the weather is poor, do not take the subway."
0,"烂酒店一个.结帐时多收了90元,回来后看帐单才发现,先讲携程帮忙查询,说是我朋友房间的消费,从来没听说过未经本人签字可以把他人房间的帐挂来的.自己打电话到总台,又说是我的早餐消费,但实际我的早餐是现金结帐,又找不到借口了.就说是在一楼咖啡厅有张我签的单子,请总台传真过来核对,又说要确认,实际上我根本没有另外的消费.还有高级房竟然是两张床,如果要大床,就在升经.周边环境更是不用讲,连个超市都没有.","One of the bad hotels. I received 90 yuan more at the checkout. After I came back, I found out that I found that Ctrip helped to inquire, saying that it was the consumption of my friend's room.Hanging. I called the main station myself and said that it was my breakfast consumption, but in fact my breakfast was cash to check out, and I couldn't find an excuse.Please fax the main station to check it, and say that you have to confirm. In fact, I have no other consumption at all. There is a high -end room that turned out to be two beds. If you want a large bed, you need to talk about the surrounding environment.There is no supermarket."
0,前台手续复杂且慢，用两个房间要签三次字；有客人刚办完入住手续就发现房间冷而要求不住的，服务人员坚持按已经住过收费，让人感到是“可下子抓住一个客人决不放过”；我们入住和离开时分别看到有客人不小心弄脏了毛巾、床单，看上去洗一下也就没事了，可服务员一定要客人赔偿，且价格不低，一条白床单要价180元；携程的价格高于该店的优惠价。,"The front desk procedures are complicated and slow, and they have to sign three words in two rooms. Some guests find that the room is cold and cannot be asked if they have just finished their check -in.The guests will never let go. ""When we stayed and left, we saw that some guests accidentally stained the towels and sheets. It seemed that it would be okay to wash it. However, the waiter must compensate the guests, and the price is not low. A white sheets are not low.The price is 180 yuan; Ctrip's price is higher than the preferential price of the store."
1,"交通很方便,附近有很多公交车.房间虽然不大,但很干净,床很硬很舒服,卫生间是小了点.酒店员工对客人很友好.我与大堂经理商量是否可以把退房时间延迟到下午2点钟,他一口就答应了.","The transportation is very convenient. There are many buses nearby. Although the room is not large, it is very clean, the bed is very hard and comfortable, the bathroom is a bit small. Hotel employees are very friendly to the guests.At 2 o'clock in the afternoon, he agreed."
1,档次不用怀疑，堂皇二字。房间设施略显陈旧，服务一流。要提醒的是，从机场大巴下车即到，小心过于热情的黑出租，会把你撞进车里，可能后果严重。补充点评2008年3月20日：自助早餐实在是太丰盛了。,"Needless to doubt the grade.The room facilities are slightly old and the service is first -class.It is reminded that when you get out of the bus from the airport bus, be careful of too enthusiastic black rental, which will hit you into the car. The may be serious.Supplementary comment on March 20, 2008: The buffet breakfast is too rich."
0,这是第一次入住此酒店，因为临时去苏州没有来得及在网上看，致电携程让她推荐的酒店，没想到有如此难忘的经历……入住后先洗澡换干净睡衣睡觉，然后就觉得脚上很痒，第二天起床后发现很多肿块，痛痒难忍！以为可能是在外地会有水土不服及过敏症状，也没在意，回上海后一天还是痒的钻心啊，就到曙光医院去看皮肤科，被医生告知不是水土不服过敏，是被虫咬，很有可能是跳蚤咬的，差点晕倒~没想到还有在宾馆给跳蚤咬得经历，是在郁闷万分，本来觉得此宾馆外观还不错，没想到……哎！建议大家以后住宾馆小心跳蚤阿……补充点评2008年8月5日：另外除了跳蚤还要补充哦，我们办入住时一群可能是新加坡客人吧，在我们之前办，等待时候看他们无视墙上禁烟标志，在那里吞云吐雾，而前台的接待非但不阻止竟然还拿出个烟灰缸给他们弹烟灰……然后进房间发现浴室门拉开和关闭十分费力，而且关不紧。洗脸台上的龙头建议店家可以换了，已经摇摇晃晃了。第二天本来想睡个懒觉的，但是房间窗帘不遮光，6点多就被太阳光照醒了，好不容易在睡着，结果9点左右就被敲门声吵醒，她无视我的请勿打扰灯，来问我要不要打扫房间，也不知道他们宾馆是怎么安排的，我只住一天难道不会等我走后再来打扫吗！另外房间只有一扇窗，窗外不到30公分就是对面屋子的墙，让我开窗见墙，也是第一次遇到的，总之对此宾馆非常的不满意，不知道还是怎么凭上金牌推荐的！,"This is the first time I stayed in this hotel, because I did n’t have time to see it on the Internet when I went to Suzhou temporarily. I called Ctrip to let her recommend the hotel. I did n’t expect such an unforgettable experience ... Take a bath and change the pajamas to sleep, and then feel thatIt itchy, after getting up the next day, I found a lot of masses, which was unbearable!I thought it might be the symptoms of soil and water in other places, and I didn't care. I was still itchy one day after returning to Shanghai. I went to Shuguang Hospital to see the dermatology department.It may be that flea bites, almost fainted ~ I did not expect that there was still a bit of flea at the hotel. I was depressed. I originally felt that the hotel's appearance was not bad. I didn't expect ... hey!It is recommended that you live in the hotel in the future to be careful of flea ... Add comments on August 5, 2008: In addition to the flea, we must add it. When we run in, a group may be a Singaporean guest.Smoking signs swallowed the clouds there, and the reception of the front desk not only stopped taking out a ashtray to play the ash ... Then enter the room and find that the bathroom door is very laborious and close.The faucet on the face washed on the face that the store could change it, it was already shaking.The next day I wanted to sleep lazy, but the curtains in the room were not shaped, and the sun was awakened by the sun at more than 6 o'clock. As a result, I was woken up at about 9 o'clock.Don't disturb the lights, ask me if I want to clean the room, and I don't know how their hotels are arranged. I just live in just one day and won't I wait for me to clean it before I leave!In addition, there is only one window in the room, and less than 30 cm outside the window is the wall of the opposite house. It was the first time that I opened the window to see the wall. In short, the hotel was very dissatisfied.of!"
1,我每次去都是要1011这个房间，可能是原因比较宽敞吧，房间有宽带，但是不是免费的，这个宾馆很容易和一天下的宾馆搞混的，好多司机都不知道路的，洗澡水不是很稳定的，一般很快就会变冷的。交通还是方便的，门口就是汉中路地铁。收费的时候告诉服务员刷信用卡，结果还是收了现金，没劲。,"Every time I go, I want the 1011 room. It may be that the reason is relatively spacious. The room has broadband, but it is not free. This hotel is easy to confuse the hotel in the day.Very stable, usually getting cold soon.Transportation is still convenient, at the door is the subway of Hanzhong Road.When charging the charge, I told the waiter to swipe the credit card, but the result was still cash."
1,早餐品种太少，交通还算便利，服务态度不怎么样，问酒店买的地图竟然就是旧的别的客房拿的,"There are too few breakfast varieties, the transportation is quite convenient, and the service attitude is not good. Ask the map you bought in the hotel, it turned out to be taken from other old rooms."
0,1。房间很小，我住的是标准间A（2008年春节房价430元），根本不值，比上海市内的还要贵；2。空调的温度调节器很糟糕，搞懂该怎么调会费你许多时间，不信可以去试试，哈哈哈哈哈哈。。。不过房间还是很温暖，温度很高，建议开点窗户睡觉，以防被热醒；3。房间也不太干净，地毯脏兮兮的；4。送的早餐太简单，只能算充饥；5。下次不会再入住顺利大酒店，打算去住“莫泰崇明八一店”。,"1.The room is very small. I live in the Standard Room A (the house price of the Spring Festival in 2008 is 430 yuan), which is not worth it at all, which is more expensive than in Shanghai; 2.The temperature regulator of the air conditioner is very bad. You can understand how to adjust it for a lot of time. If you do n’t believe it, you can try it, hahahahahaha.EssenceEssenceHowever, the room is still very warm and the temperature is very high. It is recommended to open a window to sleep to prevent it from being awakened; 3.The room is not very clean, the carpet is dirty; 4.The breakfast for the delivery is too simple to be hungry; 5.Next time, I will not stay in a smooth hotel again, intending to stay in ""Mogai Chongming Bayi Store""."
1,"酒店位置不错，挺方便的。最好的是,隔壁就是八达航空公司,有BUS从洛阳到郑州的新郑机场,非常方便,最晚的一班是下午2：30从洛阳出发。酒店房间不错，就是有气味，受不了：（这个问题不解决，下次实在不想住了。何况价格没什么优势。","The hotel location is good and convenient.The best thing is that the next door is the Octopus Airlines. There is a BUS from Luoyang to Zhengzhou New Zheng Airport. It is very convenient. The latest class is from Luoyang at 2:30 pm.The hotel room is good, but there is a smell, and I can't stand it: (This problem is not resolved, and I really don't want to live next time. Besides, the price has no advantage."
1,环境很好，闹中取静。送餐服务太贵，超出这个档次的同类酒店。,The environment is very good.The food delivery service is too expensive to exceed similar hotels exceeding this grade.
1,此酒店硬件不错，但在酒店吃饭的人较少的原因，菜的花样较少，望能进一步提高,"This hotel has good hardware, but there are fewer people who eat at the hotel. There are fewer dishes."
1,酒店整体感觉不错，服务很好，房间也很大，特别是房间内有太妃躺椅，躺在上面看书看电视很惬意，位置很好，机场大巴在长江路站下车，回走百米即到，对面是伊犁大酒店，出门左拐再左拐走五分钟到五一夜市（虽然此夜市不咋的），打车到红山、大巴扎均在六元起价以内，唯一的遗憾是房间隔音很差，碰见吵闹的隔壁住户就挺惨，好在可电话前台出面制止，或第二天要求换房。,"The hotel feels good as a whole, the service is very good, and the room is very large, especially in the room with a concubine lying chair. It is very pleasant to lie on it to read a book and watch TV. The airport bus get off at Changjiang Road Station.On the opposite side is the Ili Hotel, turn left and turn left for five minutes to five -one night market (although this night market is not good), take a taxi to Hongshan and Dabaza at a starting price of six yuan. The only regret is that the room isThe sound insulation is very poor. The residents next door are miserable. Fortunately, the front desk of the phone can be stopped, or the house is required to change the house the next day."
0,"房间还可以,设施简单,不像是四星标准。早餐还算丰富,不过要早去。前台接待、结算速度和态度还不错。后院停车场很有特点，一晚上有两台车被划伤，真恐怖，最关键的是保安及小头目还不想认帐，气愤啊","The room is okay, the facilities are simple, unlike the four -star standard.Breakfast is rich, but go early.The front desk reception, settlement speed and attitude are not bad.The parking lot in the backyard is very distinctive. Two cars were scratched all night. It was really terrifying."
0,这个宾馆的接待人员没有丝毫的职业道德可言。我以前定过几次这个宾馆，通常情况下因为入住客人少，因此未发生与他们的冲突，此于他们说要接待一个团，为了腾房，就要强迫已入住的客人退房，而且态度恶劣，言语嚣张，还采用欺骗手段说有其他的房间，先引诱客人退房。然后再说没有空房。这样的欺骗行为，造成了我没能及时定到其他酒店的房间！！！差就一个字！！差，太差！极其差！,"The reception staff of this hotel does not have the slightest professional ethics.I have settled this hotel several times before. Usually, because there are few guests in the guests, there is no conflict with them. They say that they will receive a group. In order to make the house, they must force the guests who have been checked to check out, and the attitude is attitude.His bad, arrogant words, also used deception to say that there are other rooms, first seduce the guests to check out.Then there is no empty room.Such a deception behavior caused me not to settle in the room of other hotels in time!IntersectionIntersectionJust one word!IntersectionPoor, too bad!Extremely bad!"
0,一个字差，入住时给我开的房卡就刷不开门，这是管理差。从前台到房间居然要换乘电梯，难道他以为自己是地铁啊，这是硬件差。房间小，没中央空调还要4XX元，性价比差。均给一分吧。,"One word is poor, and the room card I opened when I check in can not open the door. This is poor management.From the front desk to the room, he actually had to transfer to an elevator. Does he think he is a subway. This is the hardware.The room is small, and there is no central air conditioner for 4xx yuan, and the cost performance is poor.Give it a point."
1,大堂大门口的平开合式的塑钢门边缘很锋利，没有进行任何的软性保护包装，也没有警示提醒，导致11日进入时手指夹伤。尽管大堂经理马上帮助进行了包扎处理。仍旧觉得安全之事无小事，这些细节是体现管理水准的重要地方。已经再三告知酒店管理人员，尽快做出修整处理，防止类似情况发生。,"The edge of the flat -open plastic steel doors at the gate of the lobby is very sharp. There is no soft protection packaging, and no warning reminder, causing a finger clip during the 11th.Although the lobby manager immediately helped bandage.There is still no trivial matter that feels safe. These details are important places to reflect the level of management.It has been repeatedly informed that the hotel managers can make amendment as soon as possible to prevent similar situations from happening."
1,酒店环境不错，设施有点儿旧，早餐还可以，服务意识不错，标三星房价高了点儿，门口的出租车不太好，只愿拉远道，最好到路边打过路车。,"The hotel environment is good, the facilities are a bit old, the breakfast is okay, the service awareness is good, the price of Samsung's house is a bit higher, the taxi at the door is not very good. I just want to pull the road. It is best to go to the roadside to the road."
1,还可以吧，四星，平湖也就这家了。我们公司的定点酒店，可是当时不知道，居然用携程订的。各方面都是标准的四星。到平湖还是住这里了。,"Okay, four stars, Pinghu is also the same.Our company's designated hotel, but I didn't know it at the time, and I used Ctrip.All aspects are standard four -star.I still live here in Pinghu."
0,以前对和春有着很好的感觉，亲自入住后比较失望……房间很旧了，一切都很旧而显得有些脏，还有些味道儿，给携程的价格也太贵了，不值！今后考虑新开的两家什么星河假日，还有百汇或者新国际假日酒店。,"In the past, I had a good feeling for Hechun, and I was disappointed after staying in person ... The room was very old, everything was old and seemed a little dirty, and it was somewhat delicious. The price for Ctrip was too expensive, not worth it!In the future, consider the two new stars holidays, as well as Baihui or New International Holiday Hotel."
1,不错的酒店，大堂和餐厅的环境都不错。但由于给我的是一间走廊尽头的房间，所以房型看上去有点奇怪。客厅和卧室是连在一起的，面积偏小。服务还算到位，总的来说，性价比还是不错的。,"Good hotels, lobby and restaurants are good.But because I gave me a room at the end of the corridor, the room type looked a little strange.The living room and bedroom are connected together, with a small area.The service is in place, in general, the price is good."
1,酒店非常漂亮，去的时候太冷了，我太太生病了，服务员非常贴心，看见我们房间有感冒药，主动给我们送上了热水保温壶，并留了祝福字条，细小的动作感觉很贴心，门前的大草坪的确很棒，放风筝的感觉也很不错！住的是豪华全海景，感觉物有所植，阳台的确很大很舒服！,"The hotel is very beautiful. It was too cold when I went. My wife was sick. The waiter was very intimate. When I saw a cold medicine in our room, I took the initiative to give us a hot water insulation pot and left a blessing note.The large lawn in front of the door is really great, and the feeling of flying kite is also very good!I live in a luxurious all -sea view, and I feel that I am planting."
1,员工服务好，房间舒适如家，硬件设施应有尽有，保持。,"The employee service is good, the room is comfortable as home, and the hardware facilities are available."
0,单人间房间极小，只能放下张小床和一张小沙发，第一个房间空调坏了，换了个房间，连沙发都没了！房间设施陈旧，只是卫生间还可以。根本达不到四星级标准，连如家这类商务酒店都赶不上，强烈不推荐,"The single room room was very small, and he could only put down the small bed and a small sofa. The first room was broken. After changing the room, even the sofa was gone!The room facilities are old, but the bathroom is okay.Four -star standards are not reached at all, even business hotels such as family can not keep up, and it is not recommended"
1,酒店的环境非常好，就在山脚下，离景点很近，也安静。但房间设施比较旧，地毯都变色了。除了这一点其他都很好！,"The environment of the hotel is very good. At the foot of the mountain, it is very close to the attractions and quiet.But the room facilities are relatively old, and the carpets are colorful.Except this, everything is good!"
1,距离旺角、尖沙咀等商业区非常遥远，就算是去海洋公园也很远。房价虽然在酒店里面算是比较便宜的一个档次，但是如果你要去购物逛街，所需要的车费也不便宜，要坐巴士还要转地铁，浪费很多时间。算是一个比较偏僻的地方。虽然房间环境不错，但是下次再去香港也不敢选择这个酒店，因为交通很不方便。而且酒店附近很多店都很早就关门了，晚上10点左右想买东西吃的话，都不知道可以去哪里买，只能去附近唯一一间比较晚关门的惠康超市里面买泡面吃了。,"It is far away from commercial areas such as Mong Kok and Tsim Sha Tsui, and it is far from going to Ocean Park.Although house prices are a cheaper grade in the hotel, if you want to go shopping, the cost you need is not cheap, you have to take a bus to the subway, and waste a lot of time.It is a relatively remote place.Although the room environment is good, I dare not choose this hotel to go to Hong Kong next time because traffic is very inconvenient.And many stores near the hotel have closed the door very early. If you want to buy things around 10 pm, you do n’t know where you can buy it. You can only go to the only nearby Huikang supermarket to buy instant noodles to eat in the nearby closing door.It's right."
1,作为服务公寓还不错。临街是有点吵，不过住的层高点，没什么影响。地方不好找。好多司机不认识,"It is pretty good as a service apartment.The street is a bit noisy, but the height of the living has no effect.The place is not easy to find.Many drivers don't know"
1,住的是￥400一个晚上的豪华标准间，本来定的是￥380一晚的但是问了前台接待人员回答说靠着淮海西路，淮海西路是徐州最主要的商业街，怕睡不着就换了朝住宅区的，400块。不过这个酒店感觉很不错，首先是服务员的态度都很好，其次房间也比较舒服，配备比较齐全；再次早餐非常不错，东西很好吃。而且交通比较方便，离火车站不远，周围逛街也很方便。呵呵，可惜没有开在云龙湖旁边，不过开在那里就没有这么方便可以逛街了。呵呵。非常不错。下次有机会还要去住。这个酒店离主要的政府机关也不远哦。,"I lived at ￥ 400 a night luxury standard room. The originally set was ￥ 380 a night, but I asked the reception staff at the front desk to answer that relying on Huaihai West Road, Huaihai West Road is the main commercial street of Xuzhou.In the residential area, 400 yuan.However, the hotel feels very good. First of all, the waiter's attitude is very good.Moreover, transportation is more convenient, not far from the train station, and it is convenient to go shopping around.Hehe, but unfortunately it was not driving next to Yunlong Lake, but it was not so convenient to go shopping there.hehe.very good.I will live next time.This hotel is not far from the main government agencies."
0,帮国外的同事预定了一晚房间，达到时因为堵车晚了所以订单被取消。但是酒店大堂居然没有通过ctrip与作出预定的我联系，而是跟客人推荐附近的其他酒店。因为当时已经晚上八点，客人无可奈何只能听任酒店的安排，最后给他找了一家附近的三星酒店，但是价格居然要一千六百多块钱。更过份的是订单状态显示已经成交，所以过了好几天我都不知道这件事，直到同事回国之后发email过来投诉才清楚这样的事情。感觉就好像是被黑了。订单被取消无可厚非，但是酒店的做法也太不妥当了，跟ctrip投诉之后最后打个电话过来把事情撇得一清二楚，至于订单显示成交一事，解释就是操作失误。之前好几年公司都用ctrip作一些酒店预定的，这件事之后以后都不会再用了。太让人气愤了。,"After helping foreign colleagues for a night, the order was canceled because the traffic jam was late.However, the hotel lobby did not contact me who made a predetermined through CTRIP, but recommended other hotels nearby with the guests.Because it was 8 o'clock in the evening, the guests couldn't help but let the hotel arrangements, and finally found him a nearby Samsung Hotel, but the price cost more than 1,600 yuan.What's more is that the order status is displayed, so after a few days, I don't know about it. It was not until my colleague returned to the country to send an Email to complain to be clear.It feels like being hacked.The order was canceled, but the hotel's approach was too inappropriate. After complaining with CTRIP, he finally called and scored things clearly. As for the order of the order, the explanation was an operation error.In the past few years, the company used CTRIP to make some hotel booked, and it would not be used anymore after this.Too angry."
1,"我入住在如家,让我这个漂泊在做技术服务的人员真正感到如家的感觉,我非常喜欢!","I stay at Rujia, so I really feel like a family -doing person who is doing technical services. I like it very much!"
1,服务很周到合理，也很亲切~房间按时打扫，还有水果送，不错,"The service is very thoughtful, and it is very kind ~ the room is cleaned on time, and there are fruits."
1,"成都完全不象是有过地震的样子，满街火锅飘香，北边一点是一个公园，到六七点都是散步、溜狗的，很是热闹。酒店只是楼层低了点，所以临街的房间早上会被车吵醒。酒店的餐厅很好，偏贵，过马路有一个川菜馆，很好，还有n多个火锅店，可惜一个人没法吃。跑题了：房间很好，checkin/out都很快，早餐不错。打车困难一点，不知道是为什么。宾馆反馈2008年7月17日：感谢您在震后与我们一起感受成都的震后生活,同时感谢您对我们提出宝贵的意见,在上下班高峰期我们会遇见打车难的问题,建议您在以后出门前先致电我们礼宾处,我们礼宾将提前安排好用车。","Chengdu does not seem to have an earthquake at all. The hot pot is fragrant on the street. The north is a park. By six or seven, it is walking and slipping. It is very lively.The hotel is just a bit lower, so the room facing the street will be awakened by a car in the morning.The restaurant in the hotel is very good and expensive. There is a Sichuan restaurant across the road. It is good, and there are many hot pot restaurants. Unfortunately, one person cannot eat.The topic: the room is good, checkin/out is fast, and breakfast is good.Difficult to take a taxi, I don't know why.Hotel feedback on July 17, 2008: Thank you for feeling Chengdu's post -earthquake life with us after the earthquake, and at the same time thank you for your valuable opinions. At the peak of the commuting period, we will encounter difficulties in driving.Call our courtesy before going out before going out, and our courtesy will arrange a car in advance."
1,一个位置不错的老酒店，还可以。但是价格不算便宜。,"An old hotel with a good position, okay.But the price is not cheap."
1,"湛江最好的酒店了,房间比较新,周围环境一般,总体的服务也不错.补充点评2008年7月6日：酒店的大堂非常大,也很漂亮","Zhanjiang's best hotel, the room is relatively new, the surrounding environment is average, and the overall service is also good. Supplementary review July 6, 2008: The lobby of the hotel is very large, and it is very beautiful."
1,"服务非常好,希望不是正好赶上奥运才这样.去哪里都有人带路.宾至如归啊!早餐还算丰富,门口也有不少餐厅.出门就是海边.风景美.值得一住!","The service is very good. I hope that it is not just to catch up with the Olympic Games. Wherever there is a way to go.

0,"酒店设施陈旧.家具很旧.电视很小.浴衣好像不是新洗的,而且就一件单布的.房门不隔音.没有免费的速溶咖啡和茶.预订时携程说酒店设施是四星级的,太失望了!","The hotel facilities are old. The furniture is very old. The TV is very small.

1,酒店和温泉服务真的是不错，比起其它去过的温泉是好很多，温泉里面的毛巾和饮料不断主动供应，还会再去的，但是在人多地时候还不知道服务有没有这么好？酒店设施略为旧一点。宾馆反馈2008年5月29日：谢谢您的褒奖，温泉区的服务是我们酒店的标杆，在客流高峰时期我们会从各部门调派人手进行增援，尽量保证对客服务。今年夏季酒店将对温泉区和部分客房进行改造，希望您下次光临时给够带给您更美的享受！,"Hotels and hot spring services are really good. It is much better than other hot springs I have visited. The towels and beverages in the hot spring are constantly actively supplying and will go again, but when people have many places, I don’t know if the service is so good.IntersectionThe hotel facilities are slightly old.Hotel feedback on May 29, 2008: Thank you for your praise. The service of the hot spring area is the benchmark of our hotel. During the peak of the passenger flow period, we will transfer people from various departments to reinforce it to ensure that the customer service is as possible.This summer, the hotel will transform the hot spring area and some rooms. I hope you will give you a better enjoyment to you next time!"

On the road, I told some of the precautions that first arrived in Lhasa. The hotel was very small. It was not the star standards in our mainland. Breakfast was okay.Two days of power outage, so we changed the hotel."
0,酒店设施和汉庭差不多，但电视不是液晶的（住别的是），酒店旁边比较荒凉，推荐住陕西路附近那几家。但我入住那天的服务员的素质太差，会员卡都办不明白。应加强对他们的基本素质培训。补充点评2008年5月7日：携程的价格实在没有竞争力，可以考虑入汉庭会,"The hotel facilities are similar to Hanting, but the TV is not LCD (living else). The hotel is relatively desolate. It is recommended to live near Shaanxi Road.But the quality of the waiter on the day of my stay was too poor, and the membership card could not be understood.The basic quality training for them should be strengthened.Supplementary comment on May 7, 2008: Ctrip's price is really not competitive, you can consider entering the Han Tinghui"
0,位置挺好，可服务态度不行。装修的也挺一般的,"The location is very good, the service attitude is not good.The decoration is also quite average"
0,4星？服务很差，房间的钥匙需要相当的技巧才能把门打开，而没人主动提，叫了服务员来开，开了就走。再次出门，再叫人来开，请教了服务人员才把方法告诉你。还有早餐不如2星的宾馆！还有总台预授了房钱，第二天却刷不出，搞了二十分钟，没经过我的同意，又刷走了房钱，预授继续冻结，很差！！！,"4 stars?The service is very poor. The key in the room requires quite skills to open the door. No one took the initiative to mention it. He called the waiter to open it and left.Go out again, ask someone to drive again, and ask the service staff to tell you the method.And breakfast is not as good as a 2 -star hotel!There is also a pre -awarded room money, but the next day I couldn't brush out. After 20 minutes, I took away the room money without the consent of my consent.IntersectionIntersection"
0,感觉不是太好，也许前台是看了其他网友的点评吧，感觉一直都在对顾客假笑，令人毛骨悚然。订酒店后还特意去问了一下说是从早上6点就可以入住并不加收房费，可是到酒店之后前台却说要等到12点才能入住。好不容易等到12点40分入住了，才发现前台给的405房间里面住着其他的房客，而前台居然一直都不知道。还有房间的被子上有超级多的毛发，太恐怖了。,"It feels not very good. Maybe the front desk is watching the comments from other netizens. It feels creepy.After ordering the hotel, I also asked for a special asking that it was from 6 o'clock in the morning and did not charge the house, but after arriving at the hotel, the front desk said that it would not be able to check in until 12 o'clock.I finally waited until 12:40, and I found that there were other tenants in the 405 room given by the front desk, and the front desk had never been known.There are also a lot of hair on the quilt in the room, which is terrible."
0,第一次订到这么差的房间，可能是黄金周的关系，价格和档次根本不等同，纱窗是坏的，马桶是坏的，空调到灌水，在山庄的饭店吃饭没放盐，价格还和上海差不多，整个宾馆好像没有人搞卫生工作似的，总结出来三个字：脏、乱、差！！！下次来不住这里了！怕怕！！,"The first time I ordered such a poor room may be the relationship between the Golden Week. The price and grade are not the same. The screens are bad. The toilet is bad. The air conditioner is irrigated.Shanghai is almost the same. There seems to be no one in the entire hotel. It summarizes three words: dirty, chaotic, and bad!IntersectionIntersectionI can't stop here next time!Afraid!Intersection"
1,开始看了2005年的几位朋友的评价，都不敢去入住。没想到现在改观了很多，房间虽小，但很整洁。下次再来的话，还会选择这个酒店。只是希望宽带能一直免费！,"I started watching the evaluation of several friends in 2005 and did not dare to check in.Unexpectedly, I have changed a lot now. Although the room is small, it is clean.If you come again next time, you will choose this hotel.I just hope that the broadband can always be free!"
1,个人觉得，东城可以说是东莞最好最方便的酒店。经常出差，入住同一个酒店次数多了就会腻，而东城入住了十多次都还没腻，还是很满意。,"Personally, Dongcheng can be said to be the best and most convenient hotel in Dongguan.Frequent business travels, you will get tired of staying in the same hotel, and Dongcheng has not been tired after more than ten times, and he is still very satisfied."
1,服务还可以，饭菜价格也挺公道，就是早餐品种少了点，没啥吃的，而且都是冷的。被子没洗干净吧，枕头和被子都是臭的，没法睡,"The service is okay. The price of meals is quite fair, that is, there are fewer breakfast varieties, there are nothing to eat, and they are all cold.The quilt is not cleaned, the pillows and the quilt are stinky, I can’t sleep"
1,如果不是太挑剔，都会对绿舟别墅比较满意的。只不过因为玩的太累了，没有享受那边的早餐及赠送的饮料。补充点评2008年3月5日：忘了还有一点。从绿舟的门口走进去比较远，步行大概15-20分钟左右吧。如果天比较热的话，建议大家还是自驾吧。,"If it is not too picky, it will be more satisfied with the Green Boat Villa.It's just because I am too tired to enjoy the breakfast and free drinks over there.Supplementary comment on March 5, 2008: Forget it, there is one more thing.Walking from the door of the green boat is relatively far away, walk for about 15-20 minutes.If the sky is hot, it is recommended that you drive yourself."
1,我入住的那天正好下雨，酒店迎宾主动打伞接送，服务很到位。房间很干净，卫生间与洗浴区之间过道有点狭窄，建议把玻璃浴墙改成可折叠或是拉帘式的。阳台漏雨，不方便观雨景。餐厅服务很好，只是菜品较少。无24小时送餐,"The day I stayed in the rain, and the hotel welcomed an umbrella to pick up and passed away, and the service was in place.The room is very clean, and the aisle between the bathroom and the bathing area is a bit narrow. It is recommended to change the glass bath wall to foldable or curtain.The balcony leaks rain, and it is not convenient to watch the rain.The restaurant service is very good, but there are fewer dishes.No meals for 24 hours"
1,酒店就在市中心区，旁边就是几个大的百货商场，比较方便。坐车的话公车就在酒店门口有站。打车的话就要和司机讲价，这个比较不好，因为海口的出租车管理混乱，讲价是普遍的现象。如果打表，表跳得飞快（怀疑被改装）。建议先询问酒店的工作人员到景点一般要多少钱，再去打的。我住的是标准双人间，房间的设备比较齐全，景观是楼景，晚上十点后比较安静。但房间的隔音好像较差，晚上睡觉时能听到走廊上发酒疯的旅客大声喧闹。房间内有预防艾滋病的宣传单，觉得,"The hotel is in the city center, next to several large department stores, which is more convenient.If you take the car, the bus will have a station at the door of the hotel.If you take a taxi, you have to bargain with the driver. This is not good, because the tax management of Haikou is chaotic, and bargaining is a common phenomenon.If the watch is fast (suspected to be modified).It is recommended to ask the hotel staff how much it usually costs to go to the attractions and then fight.I live in a standard double room. The equipment in the room is relatively complete.But the sound insulation in the room seemed to be poor. When I was sleeping at night, I could hear the crazy travelers in the corridor loudly.There is a leaflet to prevent AIDS in the room. I think"
1,"整体环境不错,离市区较远，出租车到火车站15快。我住南楼，298的价位跟房间环境比算贵。结账遇到很大麻烦，先说我用了付费饮料及食品。后来又说浴袍没了。通常大家住店都不会检查其是否存在。尤其是在四星酒店。","The overall environment is good, far from the urban area, and the taxi to the train station is 15 faster.I live in the South Tower. The price of 298 is more expensive to the room environment.I was very troublesome when I met at the checkout. I first said that I used paid drinks and food.Later, I said that the bathrobe was gone.Usually, everyone does not check whether it exists.Especially at the Four Star Hotel."
0,楼下说的都对，实在是不值得住呀！位置很偏僻，晚上想吃个饭，还要打车出去。价格太高，移动的贵宾卡的折扣远比携程优惠。房间比较大，结果晚上很冷，服务员主动说送一床被子过来，可惜两天都没有送过来！洗澡间如楼下说的，插座在里面，非常危险，是不是要等出了事后才改造呀？早餐在前面的投资大厦一楼的咖啡厅吃，不方便，并且，早餐看似品种很多，只是看来看去，实在没有什么可以吃的。宽带倒是免费的，不过晚上有小姐电话骚扰、,"It's right downstairs, it's not worth living!The location is very remote. I want to have a meal at night and take a taxi.The price is too high, and the discount of moving VIP cards is far better than Ctrip.The room was relatively large, and it was very cold at night. The waiter took the initiative to send a quilt to the quilt, but unfortunately did not send it for two days!As the bathroom said downstairs, the socket is very dangerous. Do you have to wait for the renovation afterwards?Breakfast is eaten at the coffee shop on the first floor of the building in front. It is inconvenient, and the breakfast seems to have a lot of varieties, but it seems that there is nothing to eat.Broadband is free, but there is a lady to harass in the evening,"
1,在这里看过很多家酒店的评价。之后选了嘉逸，总体感觉很好，很满意。,"I have seen the evaluation of many hotels here.Afterwards, I chose Jiayi, and I felt very good and satisfied."
1,闹中取静的一个地方，在窗前能看到不错的风景。酒店价格的确有些偏高,A place where the quietness can be seen in front of the window can see a good scenery.The price of the hotel is indeed a bit high
1,刚刚进去不知道大堂在那里，上了电梯才发觉在楼上，特别小。觉得房间还可以，设施还是比较新，也比较干净。就是房间小了点，可能是我住的单间的原因。早餐一般。就是地理位置比较优越，离购物商场比较近。,"I just went in and didn't know where the lobby was there, and I found it upstairs when I got on the elevator.I think the room is okay, the facilities are relatively new and clean.It is a little smaller in the room, which may be the reason why I live in a single room.Breakfast is average.The geographical location is superior, which is closer to the shopping mall."
0,前面几位评价误导了我。下次不会去住了。主要问题是：1、整个走廊里味道很不好，是那种很潮、旧的味道。电梯间有浓重的餐厅飘来的油烟味。2、房间太小，我定的高级大床房，可是除了一张床，已经没有多少地方了。3、1~5层是商场和超市，环境很嘈杂。好处是：被褥是白色的，看着还很干净。可以延住到2点，只需要加110块快钱。比较人性化。可以吃个午饭再休息一下。服务态度比较好。总体评价：是一个很老旧的酒店，设施也就1星，服务2星。,"The previous evaluation misleaded me.I won't live next time.The main problem is: 1. The taste in the entire corridor is very bad, it is a very trendy and old taste.The elevator has a strong smell of oil fume floating in the restaurant.2. The room is too small. I set a high -end bed room, but there is no place except a bed.3, 1 ~ 5 are shopping malls and supermarkets, and the environment is very noisy.The advantage is that the bedding is white and it looks very clean.It can be extended to 2 points, just add 110 yuan.More humane.You can take a lunch and rest.The service attitude is better.Overall evaluation: It is a very old hotel with 1 star facilities and 2 stars."
1,表面给人的感觉不错，很富丽堂皇。房间很大但是服务一般。房间也没有那么干净，和大堂配不上号。而且只是自评的五星。并不是国家承认的。,"On the surface, it feels good and magnificent.The room is large but the service is average.The room is not so clean, and it is not worthy of the lobby.And it's just a five -star self -assessment.It was not recognized by the state."
1,房间还行，就是淋浴不好，水太慢了，希望改进一下,"The room is okay, but the shower is not good, the water is too slow, I hope to improve it"
0,很一般，住的是一楼的房间，窗户后面一堵墙，只看到窗和墙之间的一堆垃圾。房间的隔音不好，楼上饮水机的声音都能听到，房间里饮水机的声音更响，不关无法入睡。最过分的是，住了两天，每天早上起床，最先看到的，就是小强在墙边爬，太恶心了。宾馆商务中心的电脑上网是10元/小时，还打不开网页。总之，整体印象不好。还有提醒大家一点，宾馆用餐的话，餐费是另外开餐饮发票的，不和房费开在一起的。,"Very general, there is a room on the first floor, a wall behind the window, and only a pile of garbage between the windows and the wall.The sound insulation in the room is not good. The sound of the water dispenser upstairs can be heard. The sound of the water dispenser in the room is even more loud, and it cannot fall asleep.The most excessive thing is that I lived for two days and got up every morning. The first thing I saw was that Xiaoqiang climbed by the wall, which was too disgusting.The computer of the hotel's business center is 10 yuan/hour, and the webpage cannot be opened.In short, the overall impression is not good.Also remind everyone that if the hotel is dining, the meal fee will be issued another catering invoice, and it will not be issued with the housing fee."
1,"不错的酒店,不过个别房间窗户只有一半,非常压抑.住了第二天赶紧换掉了.游泳池值得一去,比起一般的酒店,这个算是比较大了.不过要走过一小片健身区,路比较滑.有服务生一直在擦干,很辛苦,值得表扬.房价合理,还是值得住的.","A good hotel, but the window of the individual rooms is only half, which is very depressed. After staying at the next day, I quickly replaced it. The swimming pool is worth one. Compared to ordinary hotels, this is relatively big.The road is relatively slippery. Some waiters have been drying, very hard, worthy of praise. The house price is reasonable, and it is worth living."
1,住了一晚，服务很到位，热情周到，房间复古舒适，但布局略显紧凑。唯一美中不足之处在于我离店之后发现手机充电器遗忘在房间，打过去电话询问前台居然不知道此事，后经服务生及清洁人员仔细寻找才找到（其实就在插座上）。希望打扫卫生的时候更仔细完美一些。总体很好，下次还会选择。,"After staying for one night, the service was in place, warm and thoughtful, the room was retro and comfortable, but the layout was slightly compact.The only lack of beauty is that after I left the store, I found that the mobile phone charger was forgotten in the room. I called in the past and asked the front desk that I did n’t know the matter. After the waiter and cleaned staff, I found it carefully (in fact, it was on the socket).I hope to be more careful and perfect when cleaning.Overall, I will choose next time."
1,所谓商务间和普通间的区别就是多了台电脑，对于自带电脑的商务旅客完全没必要多加100元，其它都好。合肥的出租车态度很差，可能是因为这个城市出租车比较少。,"The difference between the so -called business and ordinary rooms is that there are more computers. There is no need to add 100 yuan for business travelers with their own computer, and everything else is good.Hefei's taxi attitude is very poor, maybe because there are few taxis in this city."
1,住的是特特特大的床，6楼，两张床拼起来的。酒店的服务很好，就连我要水果刀吃水果，他们也立刻送来。很不错的地段，觉得性价比很高。就是晚上夜总会太吵，如果晚上电梯经过3楼停下，一开门就是很吵的音乐。,"I lived in a special bed. On the 6th floor, two beds were fighting.The hotel's service is very good. Even I want a fruit knife to eat fruit, they immediately sent it.A very good location, I feel that the price is very high.It ’s too noisy at night. If the elevator stops at the third floor at night, it is a very noisy music when you open the door."
1,"服务态度不错,遇到的每一位服务人员都能主动问好,老外很多,这个酒店可能有不同层面的客房,下次咱得换个房间住住。","The service attitude is good. Every service staff encountered can take the initiative to ask, there are many foreigners. This hotel may have different levels of guest rooms. Next time we have to change the room to live."
0,在老火车站旁，环境不好。感觉房间也不怎么干净，房间里东西也贵。,"Next to the old railway station, the environment is not good.I feel that the room is not very clean, and things in the room are expensive."
0,酒店设施起码有十年使用时间了，而且维护欠佳，走进房间，一股发霉的味道扑鼻而来，地毯上污迹斑斑；走廊里的木制衣帽柜，柜门无法正常关闭，打开柜门霉味更浓，衣帽柜上面还有一个关不上的小柜门，打开后，发现里面是管道和蜘蛛网、以及厚厚的尘土。床和控制台中间的空地上居然还留有上次住过的客人留下的空饮料瓶，卫生间的毛巾上居然还有几根头发……真不能相信这就是电话预定员眼中的“网友评价较高”、“三星酒店”。今后如果再遇到上网条件不便又急于订酒店的情况，我绝对不会贸然做出电话订房的风险举动！,"The hotel facilities have been used at least ten years, and they are not well maintained. Walking into the room, a moldy smell comes, and the carpet is stained; the wooden cloak cabinet in the corridor, the cabinet door cannot be closed normally, opened it to open it, open it, and open it. Open it.The mildew taste of the cabinet, there is also a small cabinet door that cannot be closed on the cloak cabinet. After opening, it is found that the pipeline and spider web, and thick dust.On the open space between the bed and the controllers, there were still empty beverage bottles left by the guests who lived last time. There are still a few hair on the bathroom towel ... I can't believe that this is the ""netizen evaluation in the eyes of the telephone reservation staff.Higher "","" Samsung Hotel "".In the future, if you encounter the inconvenience of the Internet, you are anxious to book a hotel, and I will never risk the risk of calling for calling!"
1,"住的是大床房,但是房间小的可怜,设施还行,楼下的路上小摊很多,都挺好吃的.酒店楼下是手机卖场,一大早就很吵,楼层高点话还可以忍受.","Living in a large bed room, but the room is small, the facilities are okay, there are a lot of stalls on the road downstairs, it is very delicious. The hotel downstairs is a mobile phone store. It is very noisy early in the morning.Can bear."
1,十次到常州九次会选择这里，朋友和同事到酒店看了后都说值，本来不想多说什么的，但这次发现了一个小问题，提出来希望酒店看到后可以改进。酒店早餐时间是7：30--9：30，我是9：05左右进入餐厅的，吃了一会儿发现服务人员开始把一些菜牌给撤了，结果我吃完饭喝咖啡的时候，由于没有提示把酸奶当作牛奶加入咖啡了，可想而知又酸又苦。这时候时间肯定没过9：30.希望服务员以后可以等全部结束再收拾。宾馆反馈2008年5月29日：尊敬的宾客：首先非常感谢您一直以来对酒店的支持以及提出的宝贵意见，由于我们的疏忽给您带来的不便，我们深表歉意。于此同时，我们也会积极整改。欢迎您再次入住！小提示：酒店的早餐时间是7：00--9：30,"Ten times to Changzhou, I will choose here nine times. Friends and colleagues said value after reading it. I didn't want to say anything about it, but this time I found a small problem. I asked the hotel to improve after seeing the hotel.The breakfast time of the hotel is 7: 30--9: 30. I entered the restaurant at about 9:05. After eating for a while, I found that the service staff started to withdraw some menu cards.It is prompted to add yogurt as milk to coffee, but you can imagine sour and bitter.At this time, the time must not be 9:30. I hope that the waiter can wait for all the end.Hotel feedback on May 29, 2008: Dear guest: First of all, thank you very much for your support for the hotel's support and the valuable opinions put forward. We apologize for your inconvenience to you.At the same time, we will actively rectify.Welcome to check in again!Tip: The breakfast time of the hotel is 7: 00-9: 30"
1,房间确实不错，帮朋友订的，朋友说这里的服务很好,The room is really good.
1,各个方面都还不错，接受渣打银行的信用卡但是不接受招行信用卡预授权，只好让朋友先代劳了。不过在退房时却又可以用招行信用卡付帐，感觉怪怪的。,"All aspects are not bad. I accept the credit card of Standard Chartered Bank but do not accept the CMB credit card pre -authorized, so I have to let my friends work first.However, when checking out, you can pay the credit card with China Merchants Bank, which feels weird."
0,脏吵小慢就不多说了。主要是安全问题！！！！忘了带门卡，正好看到服务员在附近，就叫他开一下门。她居然连我名字都没问直接开门让我进去了。瀑布寒……从来没见过这么方便的，要是小偷，哈哈，肯定笑死了。我电脑psp什么的还在房间，丢了都不知道找谁哭去,"I won't say much about dirty noisy.Mainly a security issue!IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionForgot to bring the door card, just saw the waiter nearby, so he asked him to open the door.She didn't even ask my name to open the door and let me go in.Waterfall cold ... I have never seen so convenient, if the thief, haha, it must be laughing.My computer PSP is still in the room, I don’t know who to cry when I lose it"
1,酒店大堂不错，但携程给的标间在北苑，是比较旧的了，肯定算不上四星，3星也够呛。如果单纯去九华山烧香的话，住在西峰山庄还是不错的，离长途汽车站近；酒店后门出去就能拦车去九华山，很方便。另外，酒店菜价比较贵，推荐大家去后门马路对面的九华山花红饭店吃饭，价格适中，菜也好吃。,"The hotel lobby is good, but the standard room given by Ctrip is in Beiyuan, which is relatively old. It is definitely not a four -star, and 3 stars are enough.If you simply go to Jiuhua Mountain to burn incense, living in Xifeng Mountain Villa is still good, close to the long -distance bus station; it is convenient to stop the car to Jiuhua Mountain when you go out when you go out when you go out.In addition, the price of hotels is relatively expensive. It is recommended that everyone go to Jiuhua Mountain Hong Hotel across the back door to eat. The price is moderate and the dishes are delicious."
0,"早上八点多到酒店,预先订了房的,却被告知十二点","I arrived at the hotel at 8 o'clock in the morning, and I booked a house in advance, but I was told that at the twelve o'clock"
0,住的房间靠近马路，比较吵。房间有股味道。不如锦江干净。不推荐入住，早饭还可以。,"The room where I live is close to the road, and it is more noisy.The room has a flavor.It's not as clean as Jinjiang.Not recommended to stay, breakfast is ok."
1,房间相当大，干净整洁。周围有很多学校住宅小吃店，比较安静，小巴知道酒店门口，交通也相当方便，推荐这里~换汇的话后门出左手边往前走拐角处有一个报摊，摊主相当风趣，rmb:hk=1：1.2，酒店换是100：97晕~,"The room is quite large, clean and tidy.There are many school housing snack bars around them. It is relatively quiet. The minibus knows the hotel's door, and the traffic is quite convenient. It is recommended to have a newspaper stall at the corner of the left hand on the back of the back door. The stall owner is quite funny.= 1: 1.2, the hotel is 100: 97 dizzy ~"
1,不错的酒店。就是早餐水果太单调。宽带直接连电信网的，速度很快。,"Good hotel.It's too monotonous for breakfast fruits.Broadband is directly connected to the telecommunications network, and the speed is very fast."
1,上海人是挑剔的，上海做酒店的人更挑剔，老公这2条都占了。在软件，他都挑不出毛病来，还有什么可说的。四星的酒店，设施有点老了，但五星的服务。有机会大家去住一次就知道了，最好开车去，他们有免费给客人洗车的。如果他们能把国际海景城酒店公寓的管理权拿下，那就太完美了。,"Shanghai people are picky, people in Shanghai are more discerning, and their husbands have accounted for both.In the software, he can't pick any problems, and what else can be said.Four -star hotels, facilities are a bit old, but five -star service.If you have the opportunity to live, you will know it once. It is best to drive. They have free to wash the car for guests.If they can take down the management rights of the International Sea City Hotel, it is perfect."
1,外观较旧，早餐一般，免费升级到豪华房，感觉还不错，热水很慢，要放很久才有。前台结账用的信用卡，不知为何至今收不到信用卡的付费信息，似有问题。,"The appearance is older, and the breakfast is average. It is upgraded to a luxury room for free. It feels good. The hot water is very slow. It takes a long time to have it.I do n’t know why the credit card for credit cards for the front desk will not receive the payment information of the credit card so far, which seems to have a problem."
1,先定的普通标间，感觉比较差，连三星都不如，就换到豪华标间，是不同的楼栋，环境要好很多，酒店给人整体感觉很平庸，没有啥特点。,The first ordinary standard room feels poor. Even Samsung is not as good. It is changed to a luxury bid room. It is a different building. The environment is much better. The hotel feels very mediocre and has no characteristics.
1,服务很不错，服务员也很有礼貌。房间宽大，设施非常全，房间拖鞋不错，比其它酒店的好多了。酒店位置也很好，购物，娱乐，都很方便。总体很好。,"The service is very good and the waiter is also very polite.The room is large, the facilities are very complete, and the room slippers are good, much better than other hotels.The hotel location is also very good. Shopping, entertainment are very convenient.Overall."
0,很偏远，外面修路，很脏乱，房间还行，服务一般,"Very remote, road repair outside, very dirty, room is okay, the service is average"
0,"这个酒店真的不如照片所显示的那么好.如果有评0分或负分的话就更好了.谈谈我的这次入住吧.12.1.中午到达酒店,1701房间,开门就能看到洗手间,入住后洗澡.于是噩梦发生了.一个漂亮的妹妹用她的房卡把房门打开了.于是我便赤裸裸的站在了她的面前,更糟糕的是她的男朋友还好奇地把头探了过来...我把房门关好,然后致电前台,得到的回答是""我们需要合适您刚才说的情况"".好吧,我等,5分钟过去了,我在打电话到前台,""我们还没有查清楚"".我的神啊,我在洗澡时一个陌生的女人闯入我的房间,我要求酒店管理人员给我一个说法,你居然说要核实,我他妈的有必要骗你吗.下楼,""请问1701房间的事情处理得怎么样了?""说了四遍后,可爱的前台小姐告诉我,她不知道.于是我问紧挨着她的另一个,唯一的另一个服务员,她告诉我,是她接的电话,她们还在核实.对不起,ctrip.我愤怒了.我要求见它们的领导,在我提出要求它们道歉,书面的.它们说它们的领导不在,我kao,站在我面前的四个人居然没有一个是领导.于是,咆哮.接着它们把我领到吧台后的房间,在房间里,我见到了它们的领导,一个母性的女人.承诺我会满足我的要求,但直到今天我没有见到它们的任何的人来给我一个说法,除了免一天房费,和一份水果外.说房间吧.床还可以.房顶开裂非常厉害,有股奇怪的异味,我买了香水喷过才好些.面盆在床头,非常的不舒服.排风扇的声音不是一般的大.洗手间设计非常不合理,洗澡时水会到处流,非常的不卫生.要收费的项目的物品有消费陷阱.我发誓,topstar的酒店我是不会再住了.一群低劣的人是不会懂得如何定义酒店的.","This hotel is really not as good as the photos displayed. If you have 0 points or negative points, it will be better. Talk about my check -in this time. 12.1. At noon, you arrive at the hotel at noon, room 1701, and you can see the toilet when you open the door., Take a bath after check -in. So the nightmare happened. A beautiful sister opened the door with her room card. So I stood naked in front of her, and even worse, her boyfriend was curious to explore her head curiously.Come over ... I closed the door of the room, and then called the front desk. The answer was ""We need the situation that you just said"". Well, I wait, 5 minutes passed, I was calling to the front desk, ""We haven't figured out "". My God, I broke into my room when I was a strange woman when I was taking a bath. I asked the hotel manager to give me a saying. You actually said to verify.Is it going downstairs? ""How did the matter in Room 1701 dealt with it?"" After talking four times, the cute front desk told me that she did not know. So I asked about another, the only other one of her to her.The waiter, she told me that it was her call, they were still verifying. Sorry, ctrip. I was angry. I asked to see their leadership and asked them to apologize, written.Kao, none of the four people standing in front of me are leaders. So, roaring. Then they led me to the room behind the bar. In the room, I saw their leadership, a mother -in -law woman. I promise me to be satisfiedMy request, but to this day I have not seen any of them to give me a saying, except for free room fees, and a fruit. Say the room. The bed is OK.Strange odor, I bought perfumes and sprayed more. The basin is on the bedside, which is very uncomfortable. The sound of the fan is not ordinary. The design of the toilet is very unreasonable. The water will flow everywhere when bathing.There are consumer traps for the items of toll projects. I swear, I won't stay in TOPSTAR's hotel anymore. A group of inferior people will not know how to define the hotel."
1,因为悦华酒店没房间了，才通过携程定泉州酒店的。虽然最喜欢的还是悦华，其实感觉泉州酒店的装修和气派还是在悦华之上，就是服务和早餐差悦华了。,"Because Yuehua Hotel has no rooms, she passed the Ctrip Dingquan Hotel.Although the favorite is Yuehua, in fact, I feel that the decoration and style of the Quanzhou Hotel are still above Yuehua, that is, the service and breakfast are happy."
1,交通非常方便，房间也不错，很适合一家出游,"The transportation is very convenient, the room is also good, it is very suitable for a family travel"
0,"设施较差,服务意识低下,半夜走廊中喧闹无比,空气极差,房间潮湿阴暗,总之只上一次当!","The facilities are poor, the awareness of service is low, the noise in the corridor in the middle of the night, the air is extremely poor, the room is humid and dark. In short, only the last time!"
1,"第一次入住该酒店,住的是高级单人间,房间不错,干净,整洁.有台式电脑,免费上网.液晶电视也不错,只是遥控器不太方便,有2个,整了半天才明白.只是早餐太差,没有什么令人难忘的回味.酒店服务态度不错.","The first time I stayed in the hotel, I lived in a high -end single room. The room was good, clean, clean. There were desktop computers, free Internet access. LCD TVs were also good, but the remote control was not convenient. There were 2, and I understood it for half a day.It's just that breakfast is too bad, there is no memorable aftertaste. The hotel service attitude is good."
1,12月1日又入住了瑞吉红塔，服务还是很好，但感觉不到以前的会心微笑了。不过，瑞吉红塔的游泳池还是一如既往地好,"On December 1st, I stayed in the Ruji Red Pagoda. The service was still very good, but I couldn't feel the smile.However, the swimming pool of the Red Pagoda of Ruji is as good as ever"
1,房间很干净，而且安静。设施也不错，特别是洗衣的服务很周到，我告诉他们我第二天早上8点要退房，第二天早上7点40准时把我的衣服送来了。在运城应该是不二的选择了！,"The room is clean and quiet.The facilities are also good, especially the laundry service is very thoughtful. I told them that I would check out at 8 am the next morning and send my clothes on time at 7:40 the next morning.It should be the best choice in Yuncheng!"
1,总的来说酒店还是很好的，有机会还会住该家酒店。早餐很丰富，而且还是免费的，吃起来很爽，唯一的不满意就是嘉宾楼离前台太远了，要走很长的一段路，在嘉宾楼很少能看见服务人员，想要询问事情非常的不方便,"In general, the hotel is still very good, and there is a chance to stay in the hotel.Breakfast is very rich, and it is still free. It tastes very cool. The only dissatisfaction is that the guest building is too far away from the front desk. You have to take a long way to see the service staff in the guest building.Inconvenient"
1,五星级酒店空降在富阳这个小地方。硬件没有什么可抱怨的，大堂气派非凡，杭州也很难挑出可以比的。江景一览无余。除了房间的一些小细节做的和大城市的五星级还有些小差距，但是在富阳，你就别想找个更好的地方了。这个酒店要是在杭州，就是800元一晚也找不到，500多的房价算是可以了。问题是，问什么在富阳会有这么好的酒店？,"Five -star hotel airborne is in the small place of Fuyang.There is nothing to complain about in hardware, the lobby is extraordinary, and it is difficult for Hangzhou to pick out.Jiang Jing has no view.In addition to some small details in the room, there is still a small gap between the five -star level in large cities, but in Fuyang, don't want to find a better place.If this hotel is in Hangzhou, it will not be found in 800 yuan a night, and more than 500 house prices are okay.The question is, what would be so good in Fuyang?"
0,"携程推荐不怎么样,总台登记后房间在打扫,让在大堂等一下,但等了一小时也没人过问,经过与大堂副理交涉亲自领进房,说赔礼送水果,等退房后没见水果送来,如不送就不要说,下次不会在住此酒店了.","Ctrip's recommendation is not very good. After the general station is registered, the room is cleaning and let the lobby wait a minute, but no one has been asked for an hour.If you do n’t see the fruit, do n’t say if you do n’t send it, you will not live in this hotel next time."
0,"临近道路边,相当的吵,隔音效果差............","Near the roadside, quite noisy, the sound insulation effect is poor ............"
0,酒店位置不错，但房间真是太差了，没订到江景房，可也没想到房间窗子竟然是对着楼道的！燥热无比，衣柜的灯出了问题一直无人修理。中餐厅上班太晚，西餐厅又难吃又贵，早餐品种少，而且量少得可怜，最后一天面包上还发现发毛了，叫了几次服务员过来，竟然敷衍说是“糖霜”，我才没有笨到那个地步呢！只有门童还比较可爱。,"The hotel location is good, but the room is really bad. I did not order the Jiangjing room, but I did not expect that the room window was facing the corridor!It was extremely hot, and the lamp of the wardrobe had been not repaired.The Chinese restaurant goes to work too late, the Western restaurant is unpalatable and expensive, the breakfast varieties are small, and the amount is poor. On the last day, the hair was found on the bread. I called the waiter a few times to come over.No stupid to that point!Only Mendong is more cute."
1,"房间很小，其他到还可以。虽然名字包含了假日，花园，但是和holidayinn,gardenhotel都不是一家。房间很小，几乎像一个小卖部：几乎所有东西都是收费的，小心。早餐很简单，很简单。总之，和大部分北京饭店的感觉一样，没什么特别的。","The room is very small, and the others are okay.Although the name contains holidays, gardens, but Holidayinn, Gardenhotel are not a family.The room is very small, almost like a small sales department: almost everything is charged, be careful.Breakfast is simple and simple.In short, like most Beijing restaurants, there is nothing special."
0,1.价格不公正，明明携程网上写的是￥200，结果住了一晚上第二天结帐时被告知￥390元，而且，预付订金的时候也没人告知价格，付订金时根本无人告知，只知道收钱，收钱时小姐把钱从客人手上抢过去。2.没有早餐，入住时携程写的双早，结果被告知早餐要￥10元/人。3.房内标明有桑拿足浴室，找了半天没有找到，问到前台（自己找下去）被告知桑拿足浴室根本没有设立好。4.卡拉OK室价格不公正，￥280元/场/人，和上海的歌城在黄金周的价格一样。5.酒店没有好路，一路上颠簸进去，结果车子费油不说，离合器还差一点挂掉，路上没有一个指路牌。6.奉劝广大住客，在和携程网确认价格之后，要再打电话去酒店确认价格，因为携程网上价格和酒店价格不同，相差甚元，不知携程如何更新他们的资料？,"1. The price is unfair. It is clearly written on the Internet that I was written on the Internet. As a result, I was informed ￥ 390 when I stayed the next day at the checkout. Moreover, no one told the price when the prepaid deposit was paid.I told that I only knew that the money was collected.2. Without breakfast, Ctrip wrote the double early early early, and the result was told that the breakfast would take ￥ 10/person.3. There is a sauna foot bathroom in the room. After finding it for a long time, I didn't find it. When I asked the front desk (looking for it by myself), the sauna footbath was not set up at all.4. The price of the karaoke room is unfair, ￥ 280/field/person, which is the same as the price of Shanghai Ge City in the Golden Week.5. The hotel did not have a good road, bumping in along the way. As a result, the car was oiling, and the clutch was almost hung up. There was no road sign on the road.6. I advise the majority of residents to make a call to the hotel to confirm the price after confirming the price with Ctrip.com, because the online price of Ctrip is different from the hotel's price, which is very different. I wonder how to update their information?"
1,房间设施，布置都别致，很有特色，一进屋就不想出来啦，不过就像网友说的因为是木楼隔音很差，楼上一动，楼下就听上去很大声，好在我们是两对小夫妻一起去的，就住同一栋了，玩基本都在楼上，要睡了一对再下去睡，因为楼上风景比较好。而且我观察过了，确实是网友讲的8628位置最好，不过我们入住那天8628已经被人入住了，我们住8633、8634就差很多，只有二楼能看到海，但小木楼的环境真的很好啊，我们那栋门口就是个泳池，环境超美，下次有机会要多住一晚（这次只住了一晚，没欣赏够啊）补充点评2008年3月1日：我们碰的服务员都很亲切，入住退房都速度很快，一上岛就有个服务员问我们是不是住岛，很热心的帮我们把行李提上电瓶车然后送到房门口，下岛时也是免费的电瓶车送到码头，一路上很热心的帮我们讲解。,"The room facilities are unique and very distinctive. I do n’t want to come out as soon as I enter the house, but just like netizens said that because it is a wooden building, the sound of the wooden tower is very poor. As soon as the upstairs moves, it sounds loud. Fortunately, we are two two.For the little couple, I lived in the same building. I was basically upstairs. I had to sleep on a pair before going to sleep, because the scenery upstairs was better.And I have observed it, it is indeed the best place for netizens to talk about, but the day when we stayed in 8628, we had been stayed in. We lived in 8633 and 8634. Only the second floor could see the sea, but the environment of the small wooden building was really the environment.It's very good. At the door of our building, there is a swimming pool with a super beautiful environment. I have a chance to stay for one more night next time (I only stayed for one night this time, I didn't appreciate enough) March 1, 2008: WeThe waiters who touched them were very kind, and they were very fast when they checked out. When they went to the island, a waiter asked us if we lived in the island. I enthusiastically helped us put our luggage on the battery car and then sent it to the door of the house.The battery car was sent to the dock, and he enthusiastically explained along the way."
1,"酒店涨价之后仍然生意兴隆,说明酒店的实力.","The hotel is still prosperous after the price increases, indicating the strength of the hotel."
1,酒店前台的小姐服务很不错。我订的房间没有，主动给我免费升级到行政楼层。酒店的自助餐很有特色。很不错的一个酒店。,"The service at the front desk of the hotel is very good.I have no room I booked, and I took the initiative to upgrade me to the administrative floor for free.The hotel's buffet is very distinctive.Very good hotel."
1,房间的设备比较齐全，价格也比较合理，附近交通也算方便。,"The equipment in the room is relatively complete, the price is reasonable, and the nearby transportation is convenient."
1,入住的是绿色套房，不知道绿色在哪里？地毯确是很脏，床很硬，会响，没有空调，不可以调节冷热！欢迎水果不知道放了多少天了，没敢吃。660一天不值得啊！,"The green suite is checked. I don't know where the green is?The carpet is really dirty, the bed is hard, it will sound, there is no air conditioning, you can't adjust the cold and cold!Welcome to the fruit, I don't know how many days have been put, I didn't dare to eat it.660 is not worth a day!"
0,早餐有时8点结束，刷卡不方便，还要压现金，房间打扫不及时,Breakfast is sometimes ends at 8 o'clock.
1,环境交通都不错，房间也可以，下次还会再来,"Environmental traffic is good, the room is okay, and I will come again next time"
1,"这家酒店真的不错.在这住了4天给了我3个惊喜:1.房间比我想像的要大,还有沙发.2.每天有水果送.3.服务员竟然在有条件的情况下免费帮你洗衣服.(帮我洗了一条牛仔裤).以后有机会再来无锡我还住这.","This hotel is really good. I stayed here for 4 days. I gave me 3 surprises: 1. The room was larger than I thought, and there was a sofa. 2. There were fruits every day. 3. The waiter was in a conditional situation.Get your clothes for free. (Help me wash a pair of jeans). I will have the opportunity to come to Wuxi in the future. I still live here."
1,总体来说还是不错的，就是酒店大堂设在商场里面给人感觉并不是很好，其他条件都尚可,"In general, it is still good, that is, the hotel lobby is located in the mall and it feels not very good. Other conditions are acceptable."
0,酒店位置比较偏僻，交通也非常不方便，而且酒店居然是没有电梯的，不太适合带着行李出游的，也不适合行动不便的人。,"The location of the hotel is relatively remote, and the transportation is very inconvenient, and the hotel is actually without an elevator. It is not suitable for people with luggage, and it is not suitable for people with inconvenience."
1,很喜欢这个酒店，服务特别好，酒店外部环境也很好，在大草坪上放风筝感觉很不错。虽然离市区有点远，但酒店可以预定巴士，无论是机场接送还是去市中心都可以预约，感觉非常方便。要住这个酒店一定要住海景房，虽然价格贵点，但绝对值得。非海景房是没有超大阳台的，感觉就差很多了。另外酒店的早餐很好吃，现在还非常怀念呢。自助餐价格也适中，味道很不错的说。就是洗澡的莲蓬头的水比较小，洗起来有点不爽。,"I like this hotel very much. The service is very good. The external environment of the hotel is also very good. It feels good to fly a kite on the large lawn.Although it is a bit far from the city, the hotel can book a bus. It can make an appointment whether it is airport pickup or going to the city center. It feels very convenient.To live in this hotel, you must stay in the sea view room. Although the price is more expensive, it is definitely worth it.There are no large balconies in non -sea view rooms, and it feels much worse.In addition, the breakfast of the hotel is delicious, and I still miss it very much.The price of buffets is also moderate, and the taste is very good.It is the water of the shower head of the bath is relatively small, and it is a bit uncomfortable to wash."
0,什么破烂酒店，可以说是携程提供酒店里面最差的了，而且差到无法形容，什么都不好，唯一地段好,"What tattered hotels can be said that Ctrip provides the worst in the hotel, and it is so bad that it is not described. Nothing is good. The only location is good"
1,环境还可以，房间比较干净，就是有点交通不便，其他都挺好的,"The environment is okay. The room is relatively clean, but it is a bit inconvenient to traffic, and the others are very good."
1,"台门在过去就是家族身份的象征。我们住的绍兴老台门客栈原是几百年前的宋家台门改建。客栈还保留着原先的院落，吱吱作响的木门，古式的木窗，木制的屏风。到处充满着老式木制建筑的味道。仿佛你就是当年鲁迅的邻居，和闰土那般年纪的朋友。我们是通过携程定的三人间200块包早饭（携程给客栈的定单确认却是220，电话投诉,连他们工作人员都说网显示确实200，也许是节假日涨了价。我晕）。电话咨询了酒店,酒店是可以免费接送客人的.后来还得知如果请他们预定火车票还不收手续费.(不过在房间里的服务指南中定票一栏没提到免费的事情).房间里是可以免费上网，不过房间放置的那电脑显示器有问题，字很模糊。自己带电脑倒是很方便。因为到客栈蛮晚的了（其实才7点多）厨房没什么菜了，就随便点了几样。酒糟酿的鸡，不知道是不是从冰箱拿出来的还是就是应该这样，很冰。臭豆腐很酥。菜算不上精致，还行吧。吃完出去逛逛，客栈离鲁迅故里的那条街非常近（估计100米不到吧）。才八点，大部分的店家都已经上了门板，昏暗的路灯照在青石板路上。让你有种远离都市，远离喧嚣的感觉。第二天，被一阵关门，下楼声，前呼后应声吵醒，听口音估计是上海游客们起床了。我不是非常喜欢上海游客，尤其是阿姨们，太过于闹腾，在公众场合叽叽喳喳让人有些吃不消。很喜欢他们的酒店风格,服务也很热情.而且价格也才相当于青年旅店.性价比确实很高,下次肯定还来住.","The Taimen used to be a symbol of family identity.The Shaoxing Old Taimen Inn we lived was originally reconstructed by Songjiataimen hundreds of years ago.Inns also retain the original courtyard, squeaking wooden doors, ancient wooden windows, wooden screens.It is full of old -style wooden buildings.As if you were the neighbors of Lu Xun and friends of the soil.We are through Ctrip's 200 -bedroom breakfast for breakfast (Ctrip's order confirmation to the inn is 220, and telephone complaints. Even their staff said that the network shows that the network is indeed 200, maybe the price has increased on holidays. I am dizzy).After consulting the hotel, the hotel can pick up the guests for free. Later, I also learned that if they are asked to book train tickets, they will not receive a handling fee. (However, the free matter is not mentioned in the service guide in the room).The room can access the Internet for free, but the computer display placed in the room is problematic, and the word is very vague.It is very convenient to bring a computer by yourself.Because it was too late to arrive at the inn (in fact, it was only more than 7 o'clock) the kitchen had no food anymore, so I just ordered a few.The distiller brewed chicken, I do n’t know if it was taken out of the refrigerator or it should be like this.Stinky tofu is very crispy.The dishes are not exquisite, it's okay.After eating out, the inn is very close to the street in Lu Xun's hometown (it is estimated that it is less than 100 meters).At eight o'clock, most of the shops have already on the door panel, and the dim street lights are on the Qingshi slab road.Let you feel away from the city and stay away from the hustle and bustle.The next day, I was closed for a while, the sound of downstairs, and woke up in response to the sound, and it was estimated that Shanghai tourists were getting up.I don't like Shanghai tourists very much, especially the aunts. I am too noisy.I like their hotel style very much, and the service is very enthusiastic. The price is equivalent to youth hotels. The price / performance ratio is really high. Next time, I must still live."
0,一般，就是宾馆设计比较有特色，但是服务实在一般。,"Generally, the design of the hotel is more distinctive, but the service is really average."
1,"酒店设施尚可,房间内镜子太多.携程的套餐包括送水果,还有巧克力,比较温馨.服务一般,入住时前台试图诱导我买早餐,两大一小每天早餐440元,两天共计880元,另外冰箱里的东西可以随便吃,被我拒绝了!第二天就不再送水果巧克力了,连免费的两瓶水也不给了...酒店离九龙又一城步行约15分钟,旁边有个公园,但是离地铁远了点,需要做小巴,有时6元每人,有时3元每人,开得飞快很吓人,小孩同样费用,就是这点不满意,还是住得离地铁近些比较方便.","The hotel facilities are still available, there are too many end mirrors in the room. Ctrip's package includes giving fruit, as well as chocolate, which is more warm. The service is general. The front desk tries to induce me to buy breakfast.Yuan, in addition, the things in the refrigerator can be eaten casually, and I rejected it! The next day I will not send water chocolate anymore, and even the two free bottles of water will not be given ... The hotel is about 15 minutes away from another city of Kowloon.There is a park next to it, but it is a bit far from the subway. You need to be a minibus. Sometimes 6 yuan per person, sometimes 3 yuan per person. It is very scary to drive quickly. The child is the same.It is more convenient recently."
1,酒店的地理位置实在不错，所以从大堂开始就令人惊艳。城景房不但在房间可以看到上海的美景，就连于是也可以边泡澡边看风景。,"The geographical location of the hotel is really good, so it is amazing from the lobby.Not only can the city scenery see the beauty of Shanghai in the room, but even a bath can see the scenery."
1,不知道什么原因，这个酒店目前的价格做了下调，而且周末居然有促销价。不错！这次入住的是大床房，依旧是紧促的布局，舒服的床，总体来说，还是很不错的！,"I don't know why, the current price of this hotel has been lowered, and there is a promotional price on the weekend.good!This time I stayed in the big bed, which is still a tight layout, a comfortable bed. Generally speaking, it is still very good!"
0,428的房间连窗户都没有，房间隔音效果太差，晚上老听见隔壁的说话声和隔壁洗手间的冲水声。下次不会再住了.,"There is no window in the 428 room, and the sound insulation effect of the room is too bad. I always hear the sound of speaking next door and the sound of flushing room next door.I won't live again next time."
1,觉得还是比较不错的酒店..周末价格可能相对于安吉这种小地方来说有些贵了..但觉得出去玩就是为了舒服..住住还是可以的...另外早餐很不错..平日价格更是超值.推荐去安吉玩的朋友入住.补充点评2008年5月8日：噢．忘了说了．．餐厅相当不错．．菜的味道很好．．又便宜．现在还有点什么菜送什么菜的活动．恕我记不太清了．有个什么很清淡的笋很好吃．,"It is still a good hotel .. The price of the weekend may be a bit expensive compared to the small places such as Anji .. But I feel that going out to play is to be comfortable .. It is still possible to live ... In addition, the breakfast is very good .. On weekdaysIt is even more value. Recommended friends who play in Anji to stay. Add comments on May 8, 2008: Oh.I forgot to say that...The restaurant is pretty good...The taste of vegetables is very good...Cheap again.What kind of dish is given to the activity of what dish is given now.I don't remember it.What a very light bamboo shoot is delicious."
1,今天刚退的房，每次住这里感觉还可以，这次入住明显的感觉是冷，房间冷，大厅冷，餐厅也冷。洗澡水也不是很热。看来冬天还是最好不住。值得一提的是早餐不错，非常丰富，而且热气腾腾的，和餐厅的冰冷形成鲜明的对照。建议：经常感觉网友对酒店的评价有些不符，后来我发现主要是房型不同造成的。建议大家在点评是将自己所住房型注明。我住的是豪华单人间，房间和床都挺大。,"The house just retired today, every time I live here, it feels okay. The obvious feeling this time is cold, the room is cold, the hall is cold, and the restaurant is cold.Bathing water is not very hot.It seems that it is still the best in winter.It is worth mentioning that breakfast is good, very rich, and hot, and it is in sharp comparison with the coldness of the restaurant.Suggestions: I often feel that netizens have a little inconsistent evaluation of the hotel. Later, I found that it was mainly caused by different room types.It is recommended that you specify your housing type.I live in a luxury single room, and the room and bed are quite large."
1,"酒店当时的团体客户多,所以临近假日,感觉散户有点不被重视了.宾馆反馈2007年10月10日：首先我们感谢您对酒店提出宝贵意见。酒店管理层非常重视客人的每一条意见和建议，总经理已敦促有关部门进行整改。对您在酒店逗留期间的不愉快，我们深表歉意，再一次对您说声对不起。我们将会进一步加强员工细节服务培训，加强专业知识的训练，期待着您再一次光临文华大酒店。谢谢！","There were many group customers at the time of the hotel, so near holidays, I felt that retail investors were a bit paid attention to. Hotel feedback on October 10, 2007: First of all, we thank you for making valuable opinions on the hotel.The hotel management attaches great importance to every opinion and suggestion of the guests, and the general manager has urged relevant departments to make rectification.We apologized for your unhappiness during your stay in the hotel, and I was sorry to you again.We will further strengthen the training of employee details and strengthen the training of professional knowledge, and look forward to you visit the Wenhua Hotel again.Thanks!"
1,"酒店的大堂很不错,房间也很好,温馨、舒适，是个不错的五星级酒店。","The lobby of the hotel is very good, the room is also very good, warm and comfortable, it is a good five -star hotel."
0,1、酒店比较陈旧，房间小；2、临街的房间噪音很大，从早到晚汽车、摩托车喇叭声不绝，路人高声讲话至深夜，无法安静休息。补充点评2008年6月21日：酒店弥漫着烟酒味道，每天如此，特别是像那种醉酒的人吐了之后的味道，很不舒服。,"1. The hotel is relatively old and the room is small.Supplementary comment on June 21, 2008: The hotel is filled with the smell of tobacco and alcohol. This is the same every day, especially the taste like the drunk person vomited, which is very uncomfortable."
1,还好，离我们的客户比较近。附近好点又实惠点的就这家了。,"Fortunately, it is closer to our customers.This is better and affordable nearby."
1,总体来说还是很不错的，中午去３９楼吃的自助餐，带小孩同往，进门前就知道我们的小孩是需要付一半费用的。但是孩子口味比较挑剔，基本没有吃什么，结帐的时候酒店方面主动免除了孩子的费用，虽然只有100多元，但是体现出的是服务生对每位客人的关注度是很高的。但是管家服务这个特色不是很明显，也就是电话上多加了一个按键而已，很多其他提酒店也提供这项服务的。,"Generally speaking, it is still very good. I go to the 39th floor to eat the buffet at noon and take the children to the same. Before entering the door, we know that our children need to pay half of it.However, the child's taste is more picky and basically did not eat anything. During the checkout, the hotel actively exempted the cost of the child. Although it was only more than 100 yuan, it reflected that the waiter's attention to each guest was very high.However, the characteristics of the housekeeper service are not very obvious, that is, adding one button on the phone, and many other hotels also provide this service."
1,"五一长假的后期入住了该酒店,正好是搞活动,200一间/天,真是超值呀.我们五人订了两间,其中一间加床,划到每人每天100元.服务和客房设施都很好,出门就是商业区,楼下就是邮局,大门是在小街上,好象是单行线.补充点评2007年7月13日：在五一期间200块钱就能住上四星级的豪华双床间,真是不错呢.","In the later period of the May Day holiday, I checked in the hotel, which happened to be engaged in activities, 200 a/day, which is really value. We have ordered two of us, one of which is added to 100 yuan per person per day.The room facilities are very good. When you go out, you are the business district, the post office downstairs, and the gate on the street, it seems to be a single line. Supplementary review July 13, 2007: 200 yuan during May 1stThe level of luxury double bed is really good."
0,这个宾馆太差了，厕所感觉不消毒，而且房间里面任何吃的东西都没有，连水都没有，电视而且都不清楚，门还不用，马桶的水要等半个小时在按才可以下去，如果不是车坏了别的酒店都满了，我是实在不想选这个酒店，宾馆服务人员态度不好，这,"This hotel is too bad, the toilet does not feel disinfected, and there is no food in the room. There is no water. The TV is not clear. The door is not used.If it wasn't for the car that the car was broken, I really don’t want to choose this hotel. The hotel service staff is not good at attitude. This"
1,携程在这个酒店的性价比不是最好的，因为后面在火车站附近看到有做活动四星的，价格更便宜，但是做为198元，这个酒店的质量与别的城市三星相比，算是很不错的,"Ctrip's cost -effectiveness in this hotel is not the best, because there are four -star activity near the railway station, the price is cheaper, but it is 198 yuan. The quality of this hotel is very compared to other cities Samsung.Nice"
1,"房间和服务都还可以,后面有比较大的停车场,非常方便驾车者;对于旅行者来说,可能经常打的士了.","The rooms and services are okay. There are relatively large parking lots in the back, which is very convenient for drivers; for travelers, they may often fight."
0,该酒店的价格和实际提供的服务相差比较大。暖气不够热，在房间里需要穿着毛衣、毛裤，甚至有时候需要盖着被子。客房偏小，而且设施陈旧。优点：离火车站很近，步行过去只需要5分钟左右。,"The price of the hotel is relatively different from the actual services provided.The heating is not hot enough. In the room, we need to wear sweaters and pants, and sometimes you need to cover a quilt.The rooms are small and the facilities are old.Advantages: It's close to the train station, only about 5 minutes by walking."
1,酒店幻境很好超安静适合休息附近的公园景色舒适惬意晚餐不错不过方便没有商店比较困难,"The hotel's illusion is very good and super quiet, suitable for the park nearby, comfortable and comfortable dinner is good, but it is convenient for shops."
1,性价比非常高的一家四星酒店。尤其是山东大汉服务生，服务非常好。自主餐很好，向您极力推荐。青岛的星级酒店很正规，比起其他的旅游城市，青岛整个环境很好，城市清洁，出租车司机都很好，不愧山东人本色。,"A four -star hotel with a high price / performance ratio.Especially the waiter in Shandong Dahan, the service is very good.It is good to meals and I recommend it to you.Qingdao's star hotels are very formal. Compared with other tourist cities, Qingdao's entire environment is very good. The city is clean and taxi drivers are very good. It is worthy of Shandong people."
0,门面很小，房间隔音较差，一直听到隔壁房间的声音。电子门锁是坏的，提出后只能给了钥匙。不过离市区还是比较近的，打的起步费就到正大广场。,"The facade is very small, the room has poor sound insulation, and I have heard the sound of the room next door.The electronic door lock is bad, and only the key can be given after the proposal.However, it is still closer to the urban area, and the starting fee for the start is to Zhengda Plaza."
1,各方面条件都不错，只是房间、卫生间较小。干净整洁，隔音效果好。,"The conditions in all aspects are good, but the rooms and bathrooms are small.Clean and tidy, sound sound insulation is good."
1,地理位置较好，在西街的街头处，购物游览交通都较方便，闹中取静，房间内设施也还可以，虽然离城市中的四星有些差距，但是在阳朔应该是最好的酒店了。但是心中还是有一些不舒服的地方，因在携程上订房时忘记写订大床间，登记入住时给的双人间，要求前台给予处理时，给到的答复是没有房间，但实际上还是有房间的。因此希望酒店在为客户着想的理念上需要再改善。当地的导游很好客，也很朴实，带我们去的月亮山脚下的“步高门”吃的中午饭，即实惠又好吃，赞。可惜在遇龙河漂流时照的照片遗失了。总的来说，此次旅行很开心，如有时间还会选择再去阳朔。,"The geographical location is better. On the streets of West Street, shopping tour traffic is more convenient.It's right.However, there are still some uncomfortable places in my heart. Because I forgot to write a big bed room when I booking the house when I book it, I asked the response when the front desk was given.Room.Therefore, I hope the hotel needs to be improved in the concept of thinking for customers.The local tour guide is very good, and it is also very simple. The noon meal for the ""step gate"" at the foot of the moon that takes us to the moon is affordable and delicious.Unfortunately, the photos of the photos of the dragons were lost.In general, this trip is very happy, and you will choose to go to Yangshuo if you have time."
1,"香港-九龙地区3星以上酒店性价比最高!交通不便但可以坐酒店免费班车,到达旺角和尖沙咀(20分钟),我15年6次住此酒店,5月3-6日通过携程预定,比香港朋友预定还要便宜!并且入住提升28楼行政标准房间,健身室和游泳免费.购物(大众化东西)方便,下面4层购物中心,酒店对面购物中心-百佳超市和XX海鲜酒楼59HKD/人自助火锅较好.步行5-7分钟就是荃湾城市购物中心广场.(奇怪?为什么网友反映购物不方便-晚上10点以后全世界购物都不方便!)酒店1层就有便利店.另外此房间18层以下好象是大陆旅行团住标准房间,18层以上携程预定豪华房间.到香港购买世界名牌此酒店就不是方便!补充点评2008年7月29日：我和爱人94年新婚旅行到香港,通过朋友定房住15层标准房间(300HKD).07年带孩子通过携程定房住22层(580HKD)豪华房间,感觉和亲身体会除交通外,各方面较理想.","Hong Kong-Kowloon region 3 stars above 3 stars at the highest cost-effective!

And check in to increase administrative standard rooms on the 28th floor, free fitness room and swimming. Shopping (popular east-west) is convenient.The hot pot is better. Walking for 5-7 minutes is the Square of Tsuen Wan City Shopping Center. (Strange? Why do netizens report that it is inconvenient to shop-it is inconvenient to shop around the world after 10 pm!) There are convenience stores on the 1st floor of the hotel. In addition, this room 18It seems to be the standard room of the mainland travel group below. Ctrip above 18 floors is scheduled to make luxury rooms. It is not convenient to buy a world -famous hotel in Hong Kong!

In 2007, he took the child to live in a 22 -storey (580HKD) luxury room through Ctrip's fixed room. It feels that in addition to transportation, in addition to transportation, all aspects are ideal."
0,房间味道好重，本来都是去住华天世纪的，他们生意太好，没有房间了，丽晶的房间感觉象好久没人住了，霉味好大，住了两天，人都快晕了，如果再去柳州肯定不住这家了。宾馆反馈2008年8月1日：对您提出的意见我们已进行了改进。酒店设有无烟楼层，也推出了奢华新装的商务行政客房，一定不会让您失望！,"The room tastes so heavy. They had been to live in the Huadian century. They had a good business and had no rooms. Li Jing's room felt like no one lived for a long time. The smell of mildew was so good.If you go to Liuzhou again, you can't hold this one.Hotel feedback on August 1, 2008: We have improved the opinions you put forward.The hotel has a smoke -free floor and has also launched a luxurious new business administrative guest room, which will not disappoint you!"
1,酒店设施非常好，服务很周到。我在前台办理入住时，因为到店时间较早（下午两点），房间还没有打扫出来，前台服务人员非常歉意地和我讲明，然后又请我到旁边酒吧区享用饮品（前台给了代金券，并有服务员带领我过去），等待房间。我刚坐下，前台服务人员就过来讲，房间已经打扫完毕，我可以去房间了。携程送的礼物也非常好，住店期间可以免费享用酒店个健身和游泳池。游泳池非常标准，水质不错，还没几个人玩。就是泳衣太贵，不过服务小姐很热情地告诉附近的超市也有卖。房间也不错。整整一面墙都是玻璃，外面有正好是绿地。很舒服。,"The hotel facilities are very good and the service is very thoughtful.When I got in at the front desk, because I arrived at the earlier time (at 2 pm), the room had not been cleaned, and the front desk service staff apologized to me, and then asked me to go to the bar area next to the bar.Vocal vouchers and waiters lead me to the past) and wait for the room.As soon as I sat down, the front desk service staff came over and talked. The room had been cleaned and I could go to the room.The gifts from Ctrip are also very good. You can enjoy the hotel's fitness and swimming pools for free during the store.The swimming pool is very standard, the water quality is good, and few people have played.That is, the swimsuit is too expensive, but the service lady enthusiastically told the nearby supermarkets to sell.The room is also good.A whole wall is glass, and there are just green spaces outside.Very comfortable."
0,隔音很差，交通尚可，设施较陈旧，总体感觉不像三星的酒店。,"The sound insulation is very poor, the traffic is acceptable, the facilities are old, and the overall feel does not look like a hotel in Samsung."
0,"1.收了包天的10元话费,却打不出电话;2.装牙刷的盒子是一个空盒子3.不提供购物袋","1. After collecting the 10 yuan call fee of Bao Tian, but unable to make a phone call; 2. The box with a toothbrush is a empty box 3. Do not provide shopping bags"
1,"这里的早餐是我看到的最差的一个,基本上没什么吃的,就看到服务员在不听的加白粥,下次在来我是不会住在这里的","The breakfast here is the worst one I saw. Basically, there is nothing to eat."
0,我是看了携程的评价才去住这里的，入住后极端失望。急忙上携程来发评语以提醒后来者不要再被蒙蔽，真不知携程的评语是怎么出来的，强烈怀疑有托。五星酒店据说是200*年开业的，房间却极其陈旧，地毯上是大块的污迹（酒店经理说是洗不出来的），墙纸脱落，门都关不严。肮脏且无安全感。我反锁了门，服务员敲门时我忘了，直接一拉门，反锁装置被拉了下来。我热了壶水（没有免费瓶装水），一倒入水杯，水杯裂了，服务员说可能是用太久了。,"I went here after watching Ctrip's evaluation. I was extremely disappointed after staying.In a hurry to go to Ctrip to post a comment to remind those who later not to be blinded. I really do n’t know how Ctrip ’s comments came out.The five -star hotel is said to be opened in 200*years, but the room is extremely old. There is a large piece of stains on the carpet (the hotel manager said that it cannot be washed out).Dirty and insecure.I locked the door. When the waiter knocked on the door, I forgot. I pulled the door directly, and the locking device was pulled down.I hot at the pot (there was no free bottle water). When I poured into the water cup, the water cup was cracked. The waiter said it might have been used for too long."
1,在淮南应该算不错了，就是开业时间久装修已经老化。,"In Huainan, it should be good, that is, the decoration of the long -term opening time has been aging."
0,前台的197号服务员，是个大约四五十岁的中老年妇女，态度很差。入住登记的时候就一脸很不爽的样子，随时要跟我们吵架，句句都是在抱怨和指责，白眼一个接一个。我们忍了，但友情提醒以后来入住的旅客，对这里的服务期望值不用太高。另外，房间紧邻4环，噪音较大。,"The No. 197 waiter at the front desk is a middle -aged and elderly woman about 40 or 50 years old, with a poor attitude.When you check in, you look very upset when you are registering. You have to quarrel with us at any time. The sentences are complaining and accusations.We endure it, but the friendly reminding passengers who stayed in the future should not have too high expectations for the service here.In addition, the room is close to the 4 ring, and the noise is greater."
1,酒店房间邻湖，南湖美景一览无余，我订的大床间，房间很别致，价钱便宜。送餐很及时，西餐匹萨做的不错，服务很到位，送餐的不能作电梯，就跑上来，很敬业！宽带很快，电脑桌在窗边，可一边上网一边欣赏美景。,"The hotel room is adjacent to the lake, and the beautiful scenery of the Nanhu Lake is unobstructed. The big bed I booked in the room is very unique and the price is cheap.The meal delivery is very timely. The Western Batsa does a good job, the service is in place, and the food delivery cannot be used as an elevator. It is very dedicated!Broadband is very fast, the computer table is by the window, you can enjoy the beauty while surfing the Internet."
1,"装修较旧,特别是地毯的材质颜色显得较脏,与四星的评级很不相称,门童很热情,赞一个","The decoration is older, especially the material color of the carpet is dirty, and the rating of the four -star is not commensurate. Men -child is very enthusiastic, like one"
0,"酒店设施老,服务态度差,这么热的天不开空调,动不动就说你们是优惠房价,不享受空调是应该的,其实整栋楼是因为入住率低才不舍得开空调的,当然泳池也不会开放的.根本没有达到4星级的服务标准,更别说服务意识了.提醒大家千万别看以前的点评,估计是他们自己人写的.因为360的饭费不包括早餐,前台竟然说如果我们付360的现金就可以早餐优惠10元,试想这是正规的酒店么?房间发票开好再想起没有查房,谁还高兴等他们查房,自然一走了之了,早知道,怎么也带点东西走呢.宾馆反馈2008年7月28日：尊敬的客人，首先我们感谢您选择入住本酒店并提出宝贵意见。对于你在住店期间的不愉快感受，我们表示诚挚的歉意。酒店对您的感受非常重视，已召开了部门的专题会议同时我们也会加强对员工的培训工作，更好的提高服务质量。希望您能再次光临本酒店，如果您在店期间遇到任何问题，请与相关部门联系，我们会圆满的为您解决，谢谢。关于您提到的饭店内部自行点评，本酒店将做特别申明：酒店无法登陆携程网的点评平台，只有客人通过携程预定并成功入住才能进入该平台，所以我们是无法自行点评的。对于您在店期间的不愉快经历，我们再次向您表示真诚的歉意。","The hotel facilities are old and the service attitude is poor. Such a hot day does not turn on the air conditioner. It is said that you are preferential house prices. You should not enjoy the air conditioner. In fact, the entire building is not willing to turn on the air conditioner.It will not be open. There is no 4 -star service standard at all, let alone awareness of service. Remind everyone not to look at the previous reviews, it is estimated that they are written by themselves.It is said that if we pay 360 cash, you can discount 10 yuan for breakfast. Do you think this is a regular hotel? The room invoice is opened and then thinks that there is no inspection room.Why do you bring something? Hotel feedback on July 28, 2008: Dear guests, first of all, we thank you for choosing to stay in this hotel and put forward valuable opinions.We expressed sincere apologies for your unpleasant feelings during the shop.The hotel attaches great importance to your feelings, and we have held a special meeting of the department at the same time. At the same time, we will also strengthen the training of employees and better improve service quality.I hope you can visit the hotel again. If you encounter any problems during the store, please contact the relevant department, we will solve it successfully, thank you.Regarding the internal comments of the restaurant you mentioned, the hotel will make a special statement: The hotel cannot log in to Ctrip.com's review platform. Only guests can enter the platform through Ctrip's booking and successfully check in, so we cannot comment on our own.We apologize to you again for your unpleasant experience during the store."
1,酒店环境还可以，特别是一对白虎很吸引人，但房间一般，价格偏高，达不到五星的标准，而且吃饭特贵，周边没有任何配套设施，有点“宰人”的嫌疑。,"The hotel environment is also OK, especially a pair of white tigers is very attractive, but the room is generally, the price is high, it does not meet the standard of five -star, and it is very expensive to eat. There is no supporting facility in the surroundings."
0,"如果去成都,在这里居住不错,行程方便,其他的都很差.最气的是请客人吃饭结完帐,很久以后到房间说台布被烫了,硬是要赔500大洋.","If you go to Chengdu, live here well and the itinerary are convenient. The others are very bad. The most angry is to invite the guests to eat and check the account. After a long time, I went to the room to say that the tablet was hot."
1,"房间设备旧了些,室内空间挺宽敞,酒店附近购物逛街办公都很方便.","The room equipment is older, the indoor space is quite spacious, and it is very convenient to shop and shop near the hotel."
0,房间还不错，够大，不过床头有部分发霉的迹象，218元的价格还是太贵,"The room is not bad, big enough, but there are some signs of mold on the bedside. The price of 218 yuan is still too expensive."
1,由于当天由于飞机晚点到凌晨实在没有心情欣赏和在意酒店的景观和服务迷迷糊糊冲进房间洗了澡就睡下了直到次日起来才有时间好好的体会一下自己身处的地方酒店服务不错交通便利总体感觉还是OK的,"Since the plane was late until the early morning, I really did n’t have the mood to appreciate and care about the hotel's landscape and services. I rushed into the room and took a bath. I fell asleep until the next day.Convenient transportation generally feels OK"
1,"我订的是318元的,但我觉得240元的风格更好一些,有一张可以半卧的沙发.建议大家订普通间!","I booked 318 yuan, but I think the 240 yuan style is better. There is a sofa that can be lying half -lying. I suggest you book a normal room!"
0,我住的是大床房，房间很小，小到放不下太多行李。不过离地铁站的距离很近，但是由于崇文门地铁最近在大修封站了，所以地理上的优势基本体现不出来，路面交通比较拥堵，很不方便。酒店的服务也不是很好，早餐不能挂帐只能买早餐券，早餐券只卖当天的，要是想第二天早上省事，只能早起去前台买。洗手间很小；房间也打扫的不干净。虽然价格不贵，但是和同价位的如家、桔子比起来差太远了，以后不会再去住了。,"I live in a large bed room. The room is small, so I can't put too much luggage.However, the distance from the subway station is very close, but because the Chongwenmen subway has recently seal the station, the geographical advantages are basically not reflected, and road traffic is more congested and inconvenient.The hotel's service is not very good. You ca n’t hang out for breakfast. You can only buy breakfast coupons. Breakfast coupons are only sold on the same day. If you want to save trouble the next morning, you can only get up early to buy.The bathroom is small; the room is not clean.Although the price is not expensive, it is too far away from the same price such as the home and oranges at the same price, and will not live again in the future."
1,酒店有点偏，（没有地铁站），19：30后就没有shuttlebus了。大堂很小，也没有什么设施。不过，房间很好，也有海景。,"The hotel is a bit biased (no subway station), and after 19:30, there is no ShuttleBus.The lobby is small and there are no facilities.However, the room is very good and there are sea views."
1,之前看携程上的评价对这个酒店没什么好感，觉得早餐可能也很烂。也有可能因为期望值本来就比较低的缘故所以实际住下之后觉得还是不错的。房间比较大，窗外面对的是摩天轮和体育馆，晚上的view很好。早餐也比想象的丰富，虽然西餐类的不多，烤面包机也不好用。服务生还是比较主动的，出门后也会主动询问是否需要帮忙叫出租车。（长沙的出租车良莠不齐需要小心）不过还是出现了不太和谐的部分，我的一个客户(欧洲人）也下榻在这个酒店，之前她欧洲的同事替她在酒店预订了接机的服务。可是在接好机之后酒店安排的接机人员问她收了600元。我的客户不懂中文而酒店方面无人可以和她交流（酒店懂英文的人似乎很少），所以她只能付了600元。虽然之后和酒店方面协商退还了部分车费，酒店方面的态度也很好，但是对于之前酒店员工乱宰外国人还是很遗憾。,"Before watching Ctrip's evaluation, I didn't have any good opinions on this hotel, and I felt that breakfast may be bad.It is also possible that because the expectation value is relatively low, it is still good after living.The room is relatively large, and the Ferris wheel and gymnasium are faced outside the window. View is very good at night.Breakfast is also richer than expected. Although there are not many western foods, the bread machine is not easy to use.The waiter is relatively proactive, and after going out, he will take the initiative to ask if you need to help the taxi.(The good and bad of taxis in Changsha need to be careful) But there is still a uncomfortable part. One of my customers (Europeans) also stayed at this hotel. Previously, her European colleagues booking the pick -up service for her in the hotel.However, after picking up the opportunity, the hotel arranged by the hotel asked her to receive 600 yuan.My client does not understand Chinese and no one can communicate with her (very few people who understand English in the hotel), so she can only pay 600 yuan.Although some fares were negotiated with the hotel, the hotel's attitude was also very good, but it was still very sorry for the previous hotel employees to slaughter foreigners."
1,"大堂有五星标准,但酒店位置有些不好,好几次个开元,这个最偏远洗手间小,马桶破旧前台入住太慢了,抽了三根烟才搞定,竟给了个无烟房早餐很中式,管饱总体服务挺好的","There are five -star standards in the lobby, but the location of the hotel is a bit bad. Several openings are opened. This is the most remote toilet room. The toilet's dilapidated front desk is too slow. It is too slow to get three cigarettes.The overall service is very good"
0,"这家酒店我一共住了3次,在这里不得不说说他的不好,因为位置离我要去的地方近,所以选择了这家酒店,但是,第一次住房间卫生太差,抱枕很脏,白床单上有一条很粗的毛发,我只好叫服务员重新打扫一遍.第二次住,房间的热水基本不能使用,水温温的,打到身上有点冷,而且第二次住早上起来发现的桌子上的面包被谁动过,想着不会有老鼠吧，于是将而包丢掉了．第三次住，房间跑出一只大老鼠，吓死我了．叫服务员来看，一直来不了，后面告诉我房间有个鼠洞，今天又开了（意思是以前这间房也经常有老鼠的），导致我几天没心情，想想之有在这家酒店还住了三次，环境可想而知有多差，有多少细菌．建议所有的人都不要去了．","I have lived 3 times in this hotel. Here I have to talk about his bad, because the location is close to the place where I am going, so I chose this hotel. HoweverVery dirty, there is a very thick hair on the white sheets, I have to ask the waiter to clean it again. For the second time, the hot water in the room is basically unavailable.Who had been moved by the bread on the table found, thinking that there would be no mice, so I lost it.For the third time, a big mouse ran out of the room and scared me to death.Ask the waiter to look at it, I couldn't come, and I told me there was a mouse hole in the room. Today I opened it again (meaning that there were often mice in this room before), which caused me to have no mood for a few days. Think about it in this house.The hotel also lived three times, and the environment can be imagined how bad and how much bacteria are there.It is recommended that everyone do not go."
0,带着70岁老人和小孩子，就因为是4星才订的，一订3间。好家伙，房间不隔音不说，淋浴水龙头一碰就掉了，水还不热。订了周四和周六的房，周四住上了，周六居然说没订单。全家提着行李在当地现找宾馆！（别说，大堂副理态度很好！就是说话不管用。）最后住到了当地3星的宾馆，价格便宜，不光服务好，房间也强多了。可真别信什么‘星级’了，太不符合现实情况了。,"With a 70 -year -old man and child, it was ordered by 4 stars.Good guy, don't say the room without sound insulation.I booked a room on Thursday and Saturday, and lived on Thursday. Saturday said that there was no order.The family is looking for a hotel in the local area with luggage!(Not to mention, the deputy manager of the lobby is very good! Just speak without using it.) Finally, I stayed at the local 3 -star hotel. The price is cheap, not only the service is good, but the room is much stronger.But do n’t believe any ‘star’, it ’s too inconsistent with the actual situation."
1,注意啦！！这个酒店只有6、7楼重新装修过（地毯是深灰色）。其他都是旧装修。我们出住时，提出要看房间，前台安排我们看了6楼。是不错的装修。地毯是新的。没有什么异味。但5楼是该酒店的KTV，很吵。但5楼的房里能听到楼下唱歌及微微的震动。所以我决定不选五楼。我问服务员，这房间是新装修的吗？因为看到洗手间的配置很新。他回答我不是，全酒店都一样。回到前台，他们给我安排了13楼。心想不错嘛。结果与朋友拖着行李到了13楼，电梯一开，已看到是旧地毯，污积斑斑。进了房间，一鼓酸臭味！洗手间也不是5楼的配置。。。差异太大了。结果，，我们做了有史以来最经典的事。。。因错按了一层号码，电梯门一开，发现也是旧装修（旧地毯，浅色大花）补充点评2007年10月10日：结果，我们决定每一层都看一下地毯来决定来入住哪一层，因我10.1期间自驾车去玩，共入住过6晚不同的酒店，前一天入住[杭州]杭州最佳西方梅苑宾馆，就是因为只相信了CTRIP的网评，在没有看房间的情况下入住了，房间感觉很不好，根本与四星不相配，所以这次一定要选好一点。我们坐电梯每一层都看了一眼地毯（当时已晚上10点，没有什么客人来往，所以我们不会打扰到其他人用电梯，而且有4台电梯的）发现只有7楼是新地毯，还是11楼及15楼是比较干净的旧款地毯（主要是霉气味不太重。来到前台要求换房，转7楼或11楼。前台也不说什么，同意换。但告之：7楼已客满。11楼是行政楼层，要加100元。最后，我们选了15楼。。要求非吸烟房。前台同意。进房，，还是有点霉气味，但比11楼小。最好笑就是看到服务员从房间里拿走烟灰缸，，哈哈！！！这就是非吸烟房！！服务员给我们打开窗户，说吹一下风，味道就没有了。天呀！！四星酒店！！！真是只有6楼的配置比较合符四星。。但5楼的噪音又将此优势给去掉了。。。但酒店对面另一家“皇冠”酒店也是四星的。比它更不好，所以，还是住下了。。这间酒店是唯一一间要退房时，查有没有东西要赔，之类的。。我前几天住三星的酒店都没有这个要求！还有，房价是298，我订了两个房共一晚，酒店要求压金2000元！,"Pay attention!IntersectionThis hotel has only renovated on the 6th and 7th floor (the carpet is dark gray).Others are old decoration.When we lived out, we proposed to look at the room, and we arranged us to see the 6th floor at the front desk.It is a good decoration.The carpet is new.There is no odor.But the 5th floor is the hotel's KTV, which is very noisy.But the room on the 5th floor can be heard downstairs singing and a slight shock.So I decided not to choose the fifth floor.I asked the waiter, is this room newly renovated?Because seeing the configuration of the toilet is very new.He answered me not, the whole hotel was the same.Back to the front desk, they arranged me on the 13th floor.I'm thinking good.As a result, he dragged his luggage with his friends to the 13th floor. As soon as the elevator opened, he saw the old carpet and stained the spots.After entering the room, a drum smell!The toilet is not the configuration of the 5th floor.EssenceEssenceThe difference is too big.As a result, we did the most classic thing in history.EssenceEssenceBecause of the wrong layer of the number, the elevator door opened, and it was found that it was also the old decoration (old carpet, light -colored flower) supplementary comment on October 10, 2007: As a result, we decided to look at the carpet every layer to decide to stay in to stay in.Which floor, because I drove to play during the 10.1 period, I took a total of 6 nights of hotels for 6 nights, and stayed at [Hangzhou] The Best Western Meiyuan Hotel in Hangzhou the day before.In the case, staying in, the room felt very bad, and it was not matched with the four -star, so I must choose this time.We took the carpet at each floor of the elevator (at 10 pm at that time, no guests came and went, so we would not disturb the other people using the elevator, and there were 4 elevators) found that only the 7th floor was a new carpet, orThe 11th and 15th floors are relatively clean old carpets (mainly moldy smells are not too heavy. When you come to the front desk, you need to change the house and turn to the 7th floor or the 11th floor. I do n’t say anything at the front desk.It is full. The 11th floor is the administrative floor, and it is 100 yuan. Finally, we chose the 15th floor. We need to suck the house. The front desk agrees. In the room, it is still a little moldy, but it is smaller than the 11th floor. The most funny.I just saw the waiter take away the ashtray from the room, haha !!! This is a non -smoking room!! The waiter opened the window for us, saying that the wind was blowing, the taste was gone. Oh my four -star hotel!!!It really has only four stars on the 6th floor. But the noise on the 5th floor has removed this advantage again... But another ""Crown"" hotel opposite the hotel is also a four -star.Still staying.. This hotel is the only time to check out if there is something to check out, and the like.. I stayed in Samsung's hotel a few days ago! Also, the house price is 298I booked two rooms for one night, and the hotel asked for 2,000 yuan!"
0,太差了，空调的噪音很大，设施也不齐全，携程怎么会选择这样的合作伙伴,"It's too bad, the noise of the air conditioner is very large, and the facilities are not complete. How can Ctrip choose such a partner?"
1,房间挺干净的，这一点不错。但是，服务上有点跟不上。比如房间里的咖啡，只有入住的第一天是免费提供的，然后就需要自己购买了，让人感觉很小气。,"The room is very clean, which is good.However, the service is a bit unable to keep up.For example, the coffee in the room is provided for free on the first day of staying, and then you need to buy it yourself, making people feel very stingy."
0,同意下的.完全正.酒店是不是童啊?水果是粒橙啊?其中一了!是五星酒店?差!差!差!600多一晚!真不可思!,Agree with the consent. Is it a child? The hotel is a child? The fruit is orange? One of them! It is a five -star hotel? Poor! Poor! More than 600 a night! Really!
1,总体还可以价格比较合理房间很干净住着也很舒服,"Overall, the price can be more reasonable. The room is very clean and comfortable. It is very comfortable."
1,酒店可能是新装修的，还算整洁。地处闹市区，交通比较方便，购物也比较方便。也是因为在市中心，所以晚上睡觉不免有噪音。服务人员态度是不错，但对客人询问的关于景点、线路等问题竟回答不上来，应该说业务知识不是很熟。总体还算不错。,"The hotel may be newly renovated and clean.Located in the downtown area, transportation is more convenient, and shopping is more convenient.It is also because of the city center, so there is no noise to sleep at night.The attitude of the service staff is good, but the questions about attractions, lines and other questions asked by the guests can't answer. It should be said that business knowledge is not very familiar.Overall pretty good."
1,真没想到，山西国贸的软硬件都这么好。服务亲切，周到。只是住的时间短了点，没有在酒店用餐，所以不能对餐饮情况作出评价。遗憾的是，通过携程订的房间明显小了点。已经好几次了。,"I did not expect that the software and hardware of Shanxi International Trade all was so good.The service is kind and thoughtful.It ’s just a short time to live. There is no meal at the hotel, so you ca n’t evaluate the dining situation.Unfortunately, the room set by Ctrip is obviously smaller.It has been several times."
1,1、酒店环境很好，张江园区环境非常好2、豪华大床房很大，而且有阳台，可以看见下面的湖，房间也很明亮3、酒店突出了商务氛围4、前台、楼层服务员、餐厅服务员热情、友好、主动5、房间地毯比较脏6,"1. The hotel environment is very good, the environment of Zhangjiang Park is very good 2. Luxury large bed rooms are large, and there are balconies. You can see the lake below. The room is also very bright. 3. The hotel highlights the business atmosphere.The waiter is enthusiastic, friendly, proactive 5. The carpet of the room is dirty 6"
1,酒店的硬件设施达到了四星的标准，24小时供应热水，水量也很足。但是服务只能算是三星的水平，早餐最多是二星的标准。由于团队过多，酒店晚上餐厅不提供点餐服务，只有自助餐。和其他地方的HolidayInn比起来，性价比差远了。,"The hardware facilities of the hotel have reached the standard of four -star, supplying hot water for 24 hours, and the water volume is sufficient.But services can only be regarded as Samsung's level. Breakfast is at most the standard of two stars.Because there are too many teams, the hotel does not provide ordering services at night, but only buffet.Compared with Holidayinn in other places, the cost performance is far worse."
1,感觉没有说的那么好！海景也一般，给我安排的是很偏的海景房！房间给升级了，不过是吸烟房间，晚上回去发现问题严重，后来给安排了1台空气净化器，问题算是解决了。房间很大，不过形状不好不实用，到是挺适合加床的！装修和配置一般，不能算豪华了！班车很方便四周也比较安静，商业一般！,"It doesn't feel so good!The sea view is also average, arranging me a very partial sea view room!The room was upgraded, but it was a smoking room. I went back to find that the problem was serious at night. Later, a air purifier was arranged. The problem was solved.The room is very large, but the shape is not practical, it is quite suitable for bed!Decoration and configuration are generally luxurious!The bus is very convenient and quiet, and the business is general!"

1,一年不如一年，说的好听还给了什么豪华标准间，说是刚装修的绝对不会再有虫子，结果房间感觉上还不如以前住的。装修的很没有品位，马桶盖还是破的，卫生间还是以前的恶心。晚上既然又出现了莫名的大虫子，很失望。总之，这个以前觉得还可以的宾馆是再也不想去了。,"One year is not as good as a year. What is the luxury standard room for the nicely, say that it will never have bugs who just renovated. As a result, the room feels worse than before.The decoration is very tasteless, the toilet lid is still broken, and the bathroom is still disgusting.Since there is an inexplicable big bug in the evening, it is very disappointed.In short, the hotel that I thought it was okay before was never wanting to go."
1,周边交通方便，但是附近有工地施工，房间很不错，就是浴室透明让人不习惯，总的来讲还是不错的,"Surrounding traffic is convenient, but there are construction sites nearby, and the rooms are very good. The bathroom is transparent and unaccustomed. In general, it is still good."
0,在九江算是难得规模大点的酒店。国庆入住的，很是糟糕。早晨回房间时2个服务员在房间，其中一个在用厕所！见进人赶紧锁门，敲门让其出来，不理，出来时在冲马桶。投诉后，高个、瘦长脸姓吴的领班说担保他们的服务员不会用客房马桶。问他凭什么担保？答不出来。又说服务员是在用厕所电话打回家，我说早晨用厕所的电话是坏的，领班赶紧说服务员其实是用自己的手机。狡辩，恶劣之极！最后问我想怎么办。我说是你在解决问题，你怎么问我？你们酒店连起码的态度都没有！最后我告诉他，挂牌四星级的酒店服务员清理客房时不许关门，服务员用客人的马桶如何保证是消毒、卫生的？不想耽误当天行程，退房走人。房间的硬件只能说是模仿四星级酒店是设施，装修用的材质很差，从没见过挂牌4星酒店用这种廉价材料，去住了就知道了。,"It is a rare hotel in Jiujiang.It was bad to stay in National Day.Two waiters were in the room when they returned to the room in the morning, one of which was using the toilet!Seeing the entrance quickly locked the door, knocked on the door to let him come out, ignored, when he came out, he rushed to the toilet.After the complaint, the leader of the tall and thin -faced surname Wu said that the waiter who guaranteed that their waiters would not use the guest room toilet.Ask him why?Can't answer.Another persuasive person was calling home with a toilet. I said that the toilet phone in the morning was bad. The foreman quickly said that the waiter was actually using his mobile phone.Sophistication, bad!Finally ask what to do.I said you are solving the problem, how do you ask me?Your hotel does not even have a minimum attitude!Finally, I told him that the listing four -star hotel waiters were not allowed to close the door when cleaning up the guest room. How can the waiter use the guest's toilet to ensure that it is disinfected and hygienic?Don't want to delay the trip of the day, check out.The hardware of the room can only be said to imitate four -star hotels as facilities. The material for decoration is very poor. I have never seen this cheap material listed on the list of 4 -star hotels."

1,非常不错，大大出乎意料，大堂不气派，但是房间真的不错，给我们安排了一间很大的房间。床很舒服，就是由于房间太大，电视距离远，没办法躺在床上看。但是干净、卫生、舒适、闹中取静。地理位置也不错！下次还来！,"Very good and unexpectedly unexpectedly, the lobby is not angry, but the room is really good, arranging a large room for us.The bed is very comfortable, because the room is too large, the TV distance is long, and there is no way to lie on the bed.But clean, hygienic, comfortable, and quiet.The geographical location is also good!Come next time!"
1,我是7月29日入住，5楼服务员有5星水准，赞。管家部经理和蔼可亲，也有5颗星，赞。只是冲淋水笼头高度太低，我要弯腰洗头，算美中不足吧。,"I stayed on July 29. The waiter on the 5th floor had a 5 -star level and praised.The housekeeper manager is amiable, and there are 5 stars, praise.It's just that the height of the water in the water is too low.

1,入住的酒店设施有点老，电视机也不较小，跟500元的房价还是有点差距的，不过服务不错，当天还送了生日鲜花和水果。,"The hotel facilities staying in the stay are a bit old, and the TV is not small. It is still a bit different from the house price of 500 yuan, but the service is good. On the same day, there were birthday flowers and fruits."
0,首先12月份的天气晚上6点才开空调，半夜的时候居然空调关了，冷得要死。房间噶小，整个房间的灯也很暗。每层电梯人口处贴了可能是这家老总和在电视上露一面的人的合影的KT板，倒胃口。服务不专业，服务员从来是冷眼对客人，觉得爱来不来，号称4星，我觉得也就是2星了。床很硬，睡得我腰疼。补充点评2007年12月18日：早餐不好，也不知道第一个人为什么那样骗大家。,"First of all, the air conditioner was turned on at 6 pm in the evening in December. In the middle of the night, the air conditioner was turned off, and it was too cold to die.The room is small, and the lights in the entire room are also very dark.Each elevator population may be a KT board that may be a group photo of this boss and a person who shows a person on TV.The service is unprofessional. The waiter has always been cold -eyed to the guests. I feel that love is not coming. I think it is 4 stars. I think it is 2 stars.The bed is very hard and sleeps my back pain.Supplementary comment on December 18, 2007: Breakfast is not good, and I don't know why the first person lied to everyone."
1,"交通方便,靠近地铁站.我住的是单人间,房间内还套了个客厅,装修很新,对比其房价还是很实惠的.早餐品种较少,不过对于经济型酒店也就如此了.","The transportation is convenient, near the subway station. I live in a single room. There is a living room in the room. The decoration is very new. Compared with its house prices, it is still very affordable. There are fewer breakfast varieties, but the same is true for economics hotels."
1,我以前没有去过重庆，感觉如果是商务出游选新华是不错的，房间和环境都不错，但自助游可以考虑银河大酒店，山城的特点就是走路比坐车快，在渝中区平面图上看似很远的距离其实走路可能不用5分钟；新华酒店旁边酒店可选择的太多了：万豪，重庆宾馆，银河，八一...,"I have never been to Chongqing before. I feel that if it is a business tour, Xinhua is good, the room and the environment are good, but the self -guided tour can consider the Galaxy Hotel. The characteristics of the mountain city are that walking is faster than by car.The distance may not take 5 minutes to walk; there are too many hotels next to Xinhua Hotel: Marriott, Chongqing Hotel, Galaxy, Bayi ..."
1,硬件不错，服务态度也不错，下次到附近的话还会选择住这里,The hardware is good and the service attitude is also good.
1,"酒店总体不错,位置靠近香洲总站,房间安静舒适,床很大,有浴衣,美中不足是早餐非常一般,要去西餐厅吃.楼下的中餐厅提供早茶服务,需要自费不能挂帐.晚上叫夜宵到房间等了40分钟,都快睡着了.而且酒店附近没有其他吃饭的餐厅,美中不足!","The hotel is generally good. The location is close to the Xiangzhou Terminus. The room is quiet and comfortable. The bed is large. There are bathrobes. Breakfast is very general. It is very average to go to a western restaurant. The Chinese restaurant downstairs will provide morning tea services.I waited for 40 minutes to the room and were almost asleep. And there were no other restaurants near the hotel, and the beauty was not enough!"
1,整体感觉还不错，去商业街也比较方便。早餐总类还算丰富，就是煎鸡蛋的服务生态度还需改进，让他煎个鸡蛋也不应一声。,"The overall feeling is not bad, it is more convenient to go to commercial street.The total breakfast category is quite rich, that is, the service ecology of fried eggs needs to be improved, so that he should not fried eggs."
0,这个酒店，让我很恼火。在CTRIP里查了一下，觉得价格比较全适。可是入住了就象是被人宰割的冤大头。房间很一般，电器也不好用。最可气的是电话费，收费比5星的还贵。我是8月15号入住的，第二天一早就走了，没打几个电话，可是收费确是48.80元。当我说要详细的电话单时，服务员只提供了一份没有时间记录的单子，上面只有电话号码和钱数。我仔细一看，气得半死。连没打通的电话也要收费0.10元，最让人无法接受的确是连打携程的800电话也要收费0.60元/分，他们这是强盗啊。当我要提出找经理时，服务员确说经理不在。可能是我说话声太大了还是什么原因，周围就上来几个男子。说不清他们想干什么。我当时也是赶时间，也怕公司怪我出差惹事同，所以我选择了付费走人。回到公司我把这个事情向携程反映了，可是携程也是无能为力。我手上有这个酒店打出来的电话单子。可这又能怎么样呢。所以我必须把事情的经过和大家说一下，不能让下一个网友上当受骗。,"This hotel is annoying.I checked it in Ctrip and felt that the price was more suitable.But staying at it is like the injustice of being slaughtered.The room is very average, and the electrical appliances are not easy to use.The most angry is the telephone fee, and the fee is more expensive than the 5 -star.I stayed on August 15th and left the next morning. I didn't make a few calls, but the fee was indeed 48.80 yuan.When I said a detailed phone bill, the waiter only provided a list without time, only the phone number and money.I took a closer look and was half -dead.Even if the phone that has not been turned on, it costs 0.10 yuan. The most unacceptable is indeed even the 800 phone number of Ctrip has to charge 0.60 yuan/minute. They are robbers.When I was going to find a manager, the waiter did say that the manager was not there.Maybe I speak too much or why, and there are a few men around.Can't tell what they want to do.I was also in a hurry at the time, and I was afraid that the company blame me to make trouble, so I chose to pay for it.Back to the company, I reflected this matter to Ctrip, but Ctrip was powerless.I have a call list made by this hotel.But what can this be?So I have to tell you about the matter, so that the next netizen should not be deceived."
1,店客房很不错，位置也很好，就在万象城背后，晚上到万象城逛非常方便，交通很便利。,"The store room is very good and the location is good. Behind Vientiane City, it is very convenient to go to Vientiane City at night and convenient transportation."
1,每次到拉萨都住，在拉萨可以算性价比高的，有接送机很方便，服务很好，没电梯服务员会帮提行李到房间，建议住世纪宾馆，世纪酒店虽然价格条件相似，但太吵，火锅味太重。,"Every time I live in Lhasa, I can be regarded as cost -effective in Lhasa. It is very convenient to have a pick -up machine and good service. Without an elevator waiter, I will help my luggage to the room. It is recommended to live in the Century Hotel., The taste of hot pot is too heavy."
0,"酒店很旧，前台服务态度也不太好，checkin的时候等了好久才给我们办理。结果第一间房间竟然是完全没打扫过的脏房间，满地垃圾。。换了第二间房间，可是房间里有一股很怪的味道，前台也有特价，如果直接通过酒店预订才100多块钱（其实这酒店也就值这个价）,通过携程却要288.黑。。。。携程确认的时候是有早餐的，结果酒店和我们说，因为房间比较紧张，早餐不送的。黑！本来准备住2天，这么黑的酒店，这么黑的价钱，勉强住一个晚上就赶紧离开了。吓死人！补充点评2008年4月9日：补充一下，我订的288可能是会展期间，所以携程价格高一些，可是酒店前台的价格依旧是100多的。","The hotel is very old, and the front desk service attitude is not very good. I waited for a long time when I checkin.As a result, the first room turned out to be a dirty room that had never been cleaned at all, full of garbage.EssenceAfter changing the second room, there is a strange taste in the room, and there are special offers at the front desk. If you book more than 100 yuan directly through the hotel (in fact, the hotel is worth the price), but it costs 288. Black through Ctrip.EssenceEssenceEssenceWhen Ctrip confirmed that there was breakfast, the hotel said to us, because the room was tight and the breakfast was not delivered.black!I was ready to stay for 2 days, such a dark hotel, such a dark price, barely left for a night and quickly left.Scary!Supplementary comment on April 9, 2008: In addition, the 288 I booked may be during the exhibition, so the price of Ctrip is higher, but the price of the hotel's front desk is still more than 100."
0,房间还可以，早餐不大好，周围比较偏僻。服务态度一般。,"The room is okay. The breakfast is not good, and the surroundings are relatively remote.The service attitude is average."
1,地理位置确实不错，直面千岛湖。可能是使用时候稍长的原因，有些地方稍有些脏，比如地毯。早餐的小馄饨很好吃，特别推荐一下。,"The geographical location is really good, facing Qiandao Lake.It may be the reason why it is slightly longer, and some places are slightly dirty, such as carpets.Breakfast is delicious, I recommend it."
1,晚上航班晚点。22点以后酒店不提供，要去接机需要付费。预定的房间没有了。酒店给升级到了套间。很大，很好。也许我到店太晚了，没听见什么飞机起降的声音。如果是在北京转机，蓝天还不错。,"Late flight at night.After 22 o'clock, the hotel does not provide it. You need to pay for pick -up.The booking room is gone.The hotel was upgraded to the suite.Very big, very good.Maybe I arrived at the store too late, and I didn't hear any sound of aircraft take -off and landing.If you transfer to Beijing, the blue sky is not bad."
1,名气不错，隔音不错，大厅很气派。床不太舒服，太软了。不喜欢。服务态度也很不错，就是入住那天棉签是人家用过的，牙刷一用就断了，第二天，忘记给拖鞋了。,"Fame, good sound insulation, and the lobby are very elegant.The bed is not very comfortable, so soft.dislike.The service attitude is also very good, that is, the cotton swab was used by the cotton swabs on the day of staying. The toothbrush was broken as soon as it was used. The next day, I forgot to give slippers."
1,这个价格这种房间环境很不错，感觉很干净^_^兴旺楼给我个人感觉很雅...下次来，肯定还定这里。。。,"This price of this room is very good, and it feels very clean^_^Xingwang Building gives me a personally feel very elegant ... Next time, I definitely decide here.EssenceEssence"
1,"订的是行政套房,比较干净.性价比尚可.不足的是冰箱居然打不开,服务员打扫卫生时丢三拉四,垃圾桶套桶打开后没放好,也没放垃圾袋.大堂的迎宾台上全是灰,酒店的清洁工作工作尚需改进.前台checkout动作奇慢.可能是五一的缘故,早餐用餐时找不到餐位,也没有服务员领座,与四星的称号不符.周边环境非常不错,阳台对着公园的湖,非常舒服.适合休闲度假.总体来说还不错,下次还会住这里.补充点评2008年5月4日：补充一点:晚上蚊子奇多,建议睡前点好电蚊香;餐厅的菜味道非常不错,值得一尝!","The administrative suite is set, which is relatively clean. The cost -effective is that the refrigerator cannot be opened. When the waiter cleanss sanitation, throw three pulls and four.The Bingtai is full of gray, the cleaning work of the hotel needs to be improved. Checkout at the front desk is slow. It may be because of May Day. You can't find a meal position during breakfast.. The surrounding environment is very good. The balcony is very comfortable to the lake in the park. It is suitable for leisure vacation. Generally speaking, it will live here next time. Add comments on May 4, 2008: Add a little bit: Mosquito Qido at night,It is recommended to order electric mosquito coils before going to bed; the food of the restaurant is very good, it is worth trying!"
1,"1.到饭店时门口数个工作人员，没有一个会打招呼，这种状况持续了两天，直到一天早晨与老外同出电梯，听到礼宾部有人说：Goodmorning!2.结帐时被一名眼前没有客人的前台小姐指到另外的柜台，但有其他人排队时她又办理了。3.一日打电话叫RoomService,要蒸蛋羹，答曰：做不了，很抱歉。这是唯一一次听到礼貌用语。可是，没有蒸锅用微波炉就不能蒸蛋吗？5.中午打电话叫人来取洗衣，回答是：我没明白您的意思。我说有一件衣服要洗，对方立马回答要加急费，我说知道，这才沟通成功。6.房间还算干净。","1. When I arrived at the hotel, several staff members would say hello. This situation lasted for two days until I went out of the elevator with the foreigner one morning.The front desk lady who had no guests pointed to the other counter, but she handled it again when others lined up.3. Call RoomService one day, steaming the egg custard, and answered: I can't do it, I'm sorry.This is the only time to hear polite words.However, can you not steam the egg without a microwave oven without a steamer?5. Call someone at noon to take the laundry. The answer is: I didn't understand what you meant.I said that there was a piece of clothes to wash, and the other party immediately answered an emergency fee. I said that it was successful in communication.6. The room is quite clean."
1,"总体来说还可,主要是正好去办事情，方便.以后基本还是住这","Generally speaking, it is mainly to do things, convenient. In the future"
0,令人恐怖的记忆！一个停水停电的酒店在零下十几度的山顶上，居然敢继续叫卖，真是让人后怕不已。幸好最后换了酒店，否则我们都将冻死在山上！！！,"Awesome memory!A hotel that stopped the power and power and power and power was on the top of a dozen degrees below minus, and he dared to continue to be sold, which was really scared.Fortunately, we finally changed the hotel, otherwise we would froze on the mountain!IntersectionIntersection"
1,总体感觉不错，特别是体现在酒店的服务细节上。晚上服务员送的牛奶，最后一晚的摆放的鲜花，给阿拉的印象还蛮深的，当然，只要是心情不错。呵呵,"Overall feels good, especially reflected in the service details of the hotel.The milk sent by the waiter at night, the flowers placed on the last night, were very impressed with Ala, of course, as long as they were in a good mood.hehe"
1,还可以，升级了行政楼层，房间一般，新但不算大。洗手间比较大，淋浴和泡浴分开，这是我升级的原因，因为宝宝喜欢泡浴。但五星级没找到有泡浴的浴盐有点失望。可以挑花香枕，但没挑，怕小朋友敏感。逛街还是很方便的。,"It is also possible. The administrative floor is upgraded. The room is average, but it is not big.The bathroom is relatively large, and the shower and bathing are separated. This is why I upgrade, because the baby likes to make bath.But the five -star did not find a bath salt with bathing baths a little disappointed.You can pick a flower pillow, but not picking it, afraid of children's sensitivity.Shopping is still very convenient."
1,海景房能看到非常美丽的景色，尽管价钱贵，但是非常值得。,"Sea -view rooms can see very beautiful scenery. Although the price is expensive, it is worth it."
0,服务很差，前台小姐根本没经过培训，我说延长一点时间退房---中午1点或2点都可以，居然跟我说超过12点就要加半天房费。全国5星酒店这是头一次碰到，一般1点退房都没问题。入住时候，酒店送足疗，号称价值98块，其实不值，而且服务很没档次，又做了其他项目，居然不能挂酒店账，要付现金，而且不给发票。补充点评2008年7月17日：看到前面有人投诉Taxi，我也想起了，司机拒载车号琼A-45153.字母也许不对，但是号码没错。,"The service was very poor. The lady at the front desk was not trained at all. I said that extending a time to check out for a little time-1 or 2 noon, I told me that it would have a half-day room fee after more than 12 o'clock.The 5 -star hotel in the country is the first time that it has encountered, and it is generally no problem to retreat at 1 point.During the check -in, the hotel was sent to suffer from 98 yuan. In fact, it was not worth it, and the service was very unlikely. Other projects were done. They could not hang the hotel account.Supplementary comment on July 17, 2008: Seeing someone complaining about TAXI before, I also remembered that the driver refused to carry the car number Qiong A-45153. The letter may be wrong, but the number is right."
1,酒店硬件来讲应该是不错的，就是位置比较远，离市中心和商业区都不是很方便，去的时候又刚好赶上出租车罢工，出行相当的不方便。但因为就在市政府对面，基本来餐厅吃东西的人都是里面工作的人，所以餐厅是不错的。如果不考虑交通的问题，建议选择！！,"The hotel's hardware should be good, that is, the location is relatively long, and it is not very convenient to be from the city center and the business district. When you go, you just catch up with the taxi strike. It is quite inconvenient to travel.But because opposite the municipal government, the people who basically eat the restaurant are people who work inside, so the restaurant is good.If you don't consider traffic issues, choose to choose!Intersection"
1,"惊喜,没想到不到100美金可以有这么好的酒店,地理位置\房间\服务\早餐都很好很好!","Surprise, I did not expect that less than 100 US dollars can have such a good hotel, geographical location \ room \ service \ breakfast is very good!"
1,酒店位置不错，房间质量也很好，就是停车位少了一点，停车有点紧张。不过也可以理解，因为处于南京市市中心。,"The hotel location is good, the quality of the room is also very good, that is, the parking space is a little less and the parking is a bit tense.But it can also be understood because it is in the center of Nanjing."
0,我对这家酒店的感觉不太好。先说缺点：1门口正在修地铁，十分吵杂。2酒店装修号称前卫与古典之完美结合，不过我个人觉得华而不实。3房间走廊黑咕隆咚，伸手不见五指。4商务部就一台破电脑和一张烂凳子，还要收钱。5酒店的餐厅外包，吃饭很不方便，早餐非常非常差。优点：1房间里被褥枕头很干净。2位置不错，在杭州商业区。3退房延迟至下午2点，可能因为入住率不高的原因吧。,"I don't feel good about this hotel.Let's talk about the disadvantages: 1 is repairing the subway at the door, which is very noisy.2 The hotel decoration is known as the perfect combination of avant -garde and classical, but I personally think that it is not true.The corridor of the room 3, black gurgling, reached out and did not see five fingers.4 The Ministry of Commerce has to collect money on a computer and a rotten stool.5 The restaurant of the hotel is outsourced. It is inconvenient to eat, and breakfast is very, very poor.Advantages: 1 bedding pillow is very clean.2 Positions are good, in Hangzhou Business District.3 The check -out is delayed until 2 pm. It may be due to the low occupancy rate."
1,一直觉得金桥不错，虽然房间有些暗，但是配套设施很好，特别是有厨房着一定，对于带着孩子来往的人很方便。就是挨着火车轨道，早上晚上会有隆隆的火车声，有些吵，房间隔音一般吧。,"I always think that the Jinqiao is good. Although the room is a bit dark, the supporting facilities are very good, especially in the kitchen, which is very convenient for those who bring their children.It is next to the train track. There will be a rumbling train in the morning and evening. It is a bit noisy."
1,酒店位置不错，位于泉州市中心。酒店硬件还行，比较新，另外工作人员的服务态度也不错。不过唯一不好的就是早餐的品种太少，而且质量一般。,"The hotel location is good, located in the center of Quanzhou.The hotel's hardware is okay, relatively new, and the staff's service attitude is also good.But the only bad thing is that there are too few breakfast species and the quality is average."
0,由于房间里面的水是锈水，大堂副理免费升级到套间，由于我预定3天，讲好头2晚是478，第三晚是578。结果第三天直接告诉只能是678，经过与携程反映也没有效果，原因就是第三天有一批人来此开会，房间不够，故意把住客赶走。坚决再也不住这里了。态度十分差劲。,"Since the water in the room is rust water, the deputy manager of the lobby is freely upgraded to the suite. Since I scheduled for 3 days, the first 2 nights were 478, and the third night was 578.As a result, the third day was directly told that it could only be 678, and there was no effect after the reflection with Ctrip. The reason was that a group of people came here on the third day, the room was not enough, and the residents were deliberately driven away.Resolutely never stop here.The attitude is very poor."
0,携程用这样的酒店，真是对自己品牌的一种打折，请国人能注重自己辛苦培养起来的品牌意识，这样的酒店实在是差劲的没有办法形容，住了一个晚上就退房了，简直就是县城的招待所，浴室的龙头只是用一个钉子固定，根本无法淋浴，只能用一个脏字来形容，以后再也不会入住这样的酒店。,"Ctrip uses such a hotel, it is really a discount on their own brand. Ask Chinese people to pay attention to the brand awareness that they have worked hard. Such a hotel is really bad and there is no way to describe it. After staying for one night, I check out.In the guest house, the leader of the bathroom is only fixed with a nail. It cannot be shower at all. It can only be described in a dirty word. In the future, you will never stay in such a hotel."
1,挺好的，但是，宽带收费系统好像不是很完美，有时候会处错误的。希望改进。,"It is good, but the broadband charging system does not seem to be perfect, and sometimes it is wrong.Hope to improve."
1,是一家不错的酒店，如果说问题，就是两次我没有打开“请勿打扰”的情况下，酒店服务员敲门，我还没有走到门口的时候，他们已经擅自开门了，呵呵，以后入住的，特别是正在进行敏感事情的朋友要注意哦！！补充点评2008年7月2日：我在网上订房时，补充说明要求“15F或者16F，最好能够看到柳江的房间”，安排房间时满足了我的要求。宾馆反馈2008年7月31日：非常感谢您对我们服务提出的宝贵意见，给你带来不便我们深表歉意，我们一定加强员工的培训，避免出现类似的服务差错。我酒店按五星级标准装修的24-26楼豪华观景客房即将竣工，期待您的光临！！,"It is a good hotel. If the problem is said, I did n’t open the “Do n’t disturb” twice. The hotel waiter knocked on the door. When I did n’t go to the door, they had opened the door without permission., Especially friends who are doing sensitive things should pay attention!IntersectionSupplementary comment on July 2, 2008: When I booked online, I replenished the instructions ""15F or 16F, it is best to see Liujiang's room"", and I met my requirements when arranging the room.Hotel feedback on July 31, 2008: Thank you very much for your valuable opinions on our service, bringing you inconvenience to us. We apologize. We must strengthen the training of employees to avoid similar service errors.The luxury viewing room on the 24th of the 24th floor of the five-star standard decoration is about to be completed.

1,酒店相当不错，离要去的白云山英语培训基地非常近。值得推荐,"The hotel is quite good, and the Baiyunshan English training base is very close to the Baiyunshan English training base.Recommended"
1,"很放松的一个酒店,很好,儿子尤其喜欢游泳池的设计.吃的选择少了点,只有主题公园来弥补了.总的来说不错.","A very relaxed hotel, very good, my son especially likes the design of the swimming pool. The choice of eating is less, only the theme park to make up for it. In general, it is good."
1,"还不错.经济实惠.条件也不错,反正我习惯这补充点评2008年4月10日：补充下，靠街的房间有些吵。尽可能不选","It's not bad. Economy is affordable. The conditions are also good. Anyway, I am used to this supplement comment on April 10, 2008: In addition, the room in the street is a bit noisy.Try not to choose"
1,老酒店翻新，总体来说还可以，性价比比较高,"The old hotel is refurbished, it is Overall, the cost performance is relatively high"
1,房间很大，但是设施有点旧。最不可接受的健身房的设施被撤掉了，五星级宾馆没有健身房的理由竟然是使用的人少，但你是五星级宾馆啊，提供不了周全的服务算什么啊，不知道管理者怎么想的！！！,"The room is large, but the facilities are a bit old.The most unacceptable gym facilities have been removed. There are fewer reasons for five -star hotels without gym, but you are a five -star hotel. What can be provided?Thought!IntersectionIntersection"
0,总体感到如家房间较干净的就是房间太小了，性价比不高，比隔壁的条件一样的快捷酒店价格上高出21元了。,"Overall feels that the room is cleaner, the room is too small, the cost performance is not high, and the price of the fast -well hotel is 21 yuan higher than the conditions next door."
1,非常喜欢这家酒店，去年的时候还是四星（要二年才能评上五星〕，今年去的时候已经是五星了，环境很不错，很有中国特色而且比较喜庆，房间也很舒适，是新型酒店的最佳选择，离浦东机场也不远。服务很热情。,"I like this hotel very much. Last year, I was still four stars (it took two years to comment on five stars]. It was already five stars when I went this year. The environment was very good, very Chinese and festive.The best choice for the hotel is not far from Pudong Airport. The service is very enthusiastic."
1,"不错的酒店,据说比重新装修前好很多.可惜酒店隔音很差,正好遇上那天有几个无赖没拿到房间一直闹,给安排了工作人员房后半夜还在闹,很烦人.虽然不关酒店的事,可是却凸现了隔音问题.服务就一般,","A good hotel, it is said that it is much better before the new decoration. Unfortunately, the hotel's sound insulation is very poor. Just when I met several rogues that day, I did n’t get the room.The matter of closing the hotel, but the sound insulation problem is highlighted. The service is average."
1,房间设施陈旧，酒店周围环境很好，服务很好，早餐很烂。,"The room facilities are old, the environment around the hotel is very good, the service is good, and the breakfast is bad."
1,是为了到西塘看夜景而选择此宾馆的。总体来说不错，相对于一个小县城。定的是豪华大床房，安排在6楼的南侧，床很大，送了水果，挺干净的，装修的也挺新的；送的自助早餐不错，挺丰富的，尤其是小馄饨蛮好吃的（到西塘想吃，没有吃成），就是有点小问题：前一个人用完后，没有撤掉刀叉，可能服务小姐认为是没有用过。由于是装了节电感应器，在冲淋房洗澡时，突然卫生间一下漆黑，以为是停电了，吓我一跳，建议时间调长些。下次到西塘或到嘉善，还会选择这家。（比世贸大酒店（五星)的服务好）,"I chose this hotel to go to Xitang to see the night view.Overall is good, compared to a small county.It is a large luxury bed room. It is arranged on the south side of the 6th floor. The bed is very large. The fruit is given fruit. It is very clean and the decoration is quite new.It is delicious (I want to eat it in Xitang, and I do n’t eat it), which is a little problem: After the previous person was used, he did not withdraw the knife and fork, and the service lady may not think it was used.Because it was installed with an inductive sensor. When I took a bath, the bathroom suddenly had darkness, thinking that it was out of power, scaring me, and it was recommended that the time was longer.Next time I go to Xitang or Jiashan, I will choose this one.(The service of the World Trade Hotel (Five Stars))"
0,"于山宾馆服务非常差,是我从未见过的恶劣.柜台动作慢,态度凶,脸色臭,房间没空调又冷又潮,餐厅更差.可能是政府公营,不在乎吧","Yu Shan Hotel's service is very poor, it is the bad that I have never seen. The counter is slow, the attitude is fierce, the face is smelly, the room is not air -conditioned, and the restaurant is worse. It may be the government of the government."
1,去几个朋友一起订的，因为要去吃蟹，窗边看湖还是风景不错的，硬件有待提高，服务还是不错的，接待我们的上海经理谈吐素质也挺高的,"I booked a few friends together, because I have to eat crabs, watch the lake by the window, the scenery is still good, the hardware needs to be improved, the service is still good, it is also very high to receive our Shanghai manager."
0,其实格林豪泰给我的印象一直挺好的，（那是因为之前住的是上海的格林豪泰），所以就想换换环境，订了三天的房，首先一进大门，感觉还挺好，接着就是前台了，那叫什么服务态度呀？晚上房间的隔音效果确实很差，隔壁大叔的打呼声简直就如同和他在一个房间，这都不说，令我感觉不错的是，这里还有早餐，之前我是不吃早餐的，别的酒店也有早餐。去了一看，天呀，这也叫早餐？包子+馒头+稀粥+咸菜------退房的时候我把这几天的早餐券全还给了他们。下次不会考虑再住这家酒店,"In fact, the impression that Green Haotai has always given me very good, (that's because I lived in Shanghai's Green Haotai), so I wanted to change the environment. I booked a three -day room. First of all, I entered the door.Okay, then the front desk is the front desk. What is the service attitude?The sound insulation effect of the room at night is really poor. The call of the uncle next door is like a room with him. I do n’t say it. What makes me feel good. There is breakfast here. I didn’t eat breakfast before.The hotel also has breakfast.Go to see, God, this is also called breakfast?Buns+steamed buns+porridge+pickles ------ I returned all the breakfast vouchers these days when I got out of the room.I won't consider staying in this hotel next time"
0,房间外声音太大，比较吵闹！直接到前台预定费用更合理。,The sound outside the room is too loud and noisy!The cost of reservation directly to the front desk is more reasonable.
0,宾馆一半的房间都没有阳光、不通风。服务员态度很恶劣。交款即便没人怎么也要半个小时。卫生间的马桶是坏的~~一不小心能把马桶给摔碎。千万小心使用。床单不干净，居然有阴毛。房间里弥漫着厕所的味道，恶心。比起其它省市的如家差得太远了，很失望。故宫周围的酒店都比这家的要便宜。觉得这家的性价比太不合适了。,"Half of the rooms in the hotel are not sunny and not ventilated.The waiter attitude is bad.Even if no one is paid, it will take half an hour.The toilet in the bathroom is bad ~~ I accidentally break the toilet.Use it carefully.The sheets are not clean and there are pubic hair.The smell of the toilet was filled with the smell of the toilet.It is too far away from other provinces and cities, and is disappointed.The hotels around the Forbidden City are cheaper than this house.I think the cost -effectiveness of this house is too inappropriate."
0,"游泳池不错,其他很一般,房间设施差,房间太小,不过价格很便宜,属于一般选择.","The swimming pool is good, the others are very general, the room facilities are poor, the room is too small, but the price is very cheap. It is a general choice."
0,要不是赶飞机，绝对不会入住这个酒店，一到前台就听到旁边的顾客和酒店人员在交涉，原来是他们放在大堂门口的私家车被撬了，车上的数码相机等东西被偷了，实在是太不可思议了！到房间之后本来想出去吃晚饭的，也不敢出去了，怕东西被人偷,"If it weren't for the plane, I would never stay in this hotel. As soon as I arrived at the front desk, I heard the customers and hotel staff next to them negotiated. It turned out that the private cars they put at the lobby were pried, and the digital cameras on the car were stolen.It's too incredible!After arriving at the room, I wanted to go out for dinner, and I dare not go out. I am afraid that things will be stolen."
0,"周六入住,花费340元,含早餐.整体感觉不象一个三星级酒店,大堂很空荡,有餐厅在里面,感觉不是很好,上电梯在一个拐角处,不是太方便,房间是一进门就见床,不象酒店的房间,就是水还比较好点,下次不会入住","Sutled on Saturday, spent 340 yuan, including breakfast.

1,"总体感觉不错.价格适中.用餐条件一般.酒店自己的餐厅不太好,隔壁的大连海鲜餐馆尚可,但不能在酒店客房签单,不是很方便.","The overall feels good. The price is moderate. The dining conditions are average. The hotel's own restaurant is not very good.

0,1，虽距离首都空港很近，但交通并不方便。航班到达时间是23：30，预约时告知有免费接送，但到着时却被告知“因超过23：00，需交60元接送费”。。。无论是否收费，或价格高低，应事先与预约客户声明才是正理。2，因为距离空港太近，几乎没有Taxi愿意接客。。。3，房间里没有吹风机，想和前台联系借用，但电话出故障。。。作为饭店业务的一环，每天检查客室设备应是最起码的工作。。。,"1. Although it is very close to the capital airport, transportation is inconvenient.The arrival time of the flight was 23:30, and I was informed that there was a free pick -up at the appointment, but when it was time, it was told that ""more than 23:00, the delivery fee of 60 yuan is required.""EssenceEssenceRegardless of whether the charges or the price is high or low, it is right to declare with the customer statement in advance.2.

0,酒店看起来设施都比较陈旧，房间里居然没有中控，非常不方便。热水到还不错。前台态度一般.,"The hotel looks older, and there is no central control in the room, which is very inconvenient.Hot water is not bad.The attitude of the front desk is average."
1,房间升级到了行政楼层房间很大，很舒服，很大的落地窗户以为会很远，但是如果坐九铁，真得十分方便到达很意外，香港还有这么大的房间！,"The room has been upgraded to the administrative floor. The room is very large, very comfortable, and the large floor -to -ceiling windows think it will be far away, but if you sit on the nine iron, it is really convenient to reach it. There is still such a large room in Hong Kong!"
1,这个酒店给人感觉不错，位置也比较好，硬件也不错，总体性价比较高，只是卧室如果有电视会感觉更好。,"This hotel feels good, the location is better, the hardware is good, the overall cost is relatively high, but if there is a TV in the bedroom, it will feel better."
0,"提早预定的房间3间标房4夜，到了酒店,看样子是个刚改造的样子,很多地方还留着小旅馆的舍不得仍掉的破烂东西(后来问了说是新加盟的格林豪泰,管理和服务还是一起旅馆式的),前台时被告知酒店没收到定房通知，等了2个小时，安排了大床房先住，到房间一看，房间小的可怜，行李没地方放，问前台说是一样的，没办法了先挤吧....晚上回酒店,前台告知有双床房可以调,赶快全部调换,没想到悲剧开始:1:新装修房间,还是很小;2:卫生间门不能锁,用着用着,淋浴头开关掉了,毛巾架也不幸掉了;3:隔壁房间说话声音听的很清楚;4:门外有个抽水电机,日夜的突然的叫,音量和音质保证让你整夜失眠乃至神经衰弱,找前台(房间里面没有电话机)说就是这样,没办法,先忍着吧....;4:到餐厅吃饭,1/4以上的筷子长绿毛,服务员吗,一副见多不怪的样子.....有幸看到这里的伙计们,建议你们去住边上的一个锦江之星,这种地方,千万不要进去","The 3 -bedroom rooms booked early in the early room were 4 nights.

When I saw it in the room, the room was small, and there was no place for luggage. Ask the front desk to ask the front desk.It's the same, there is no way to squeeze first .... Back to the hotel in the evening, the front desk is informed that there is a double -bed room to adjust, and all of them are replaced.

Fortunately, see the guys here, I suggest you go to a star of Jinjiang on the side, so do not go in"
0,酒店是旧房改造，怪味根本无法忍受，若不是酒店不肯退当天的钱，我连这一晚也决不会呆。酒店没有提供饮食，旁边的永和超贵，没有什么好吃的。不明白其他朋友怎么给这么高分？,"The hotel is the renovation of the old house, and the strange smell is unbearable. If it wasn't for the hotel to refund the money on the day, I would never stay in this night.The hotel does not provide diet, and the Yonghe is super expensive, there is nothing delicious.Don't understand how other friends give such a high score?"
1,"房间比较宽敞,环境比较好,酒店服务可卷可点,价格比较合理，认为应该是到周庄游玩比较好的选择，总体感觉不错。",The room is relatively spacious and the environment is better. The hotel service can be rolled and the price is more reasonable. It is believed that it should be a better choice to play in Zhouzhuang. The overall feels good.
1,2月1日晚上，杭州下了一场少见的大雪，在这样一个大雪纷飞的晚上入住这个温暖的酒店，没有什么好抱怨的。2月2日早晨，到一楼餐厅用餐，偌大的落地玻璃窗外，花园内外一派银装素裹；餐后从园子里准备开车出行，两个年轻的保安热情地帮忙清理车上厚厚的积雪；开车在江南大道上，看见一队队的人民解放军战士在清扫马路，鲜艳的军旗在寒风中蓬勃飘扬……在这样一个冰天雪地的早晨，总有一些感动可以让我们感觉温暖在我们中国这个幅员辽阔、地大物博、人口众多的国度，让我们守望相助，拥抱和祥,"On the evening of February 1, Hangzhou made a rare snow. In such a heavy snowy night, there was nothing to complain about.On the morning of February 2nd, I went to the dining room on the first floor.

0,哈哈~这宾馆太逗了，我们大老远从北京到这，一住才发现，这整个一老干部疗养所啊！到处都是穿西服，打领带挺着大肚子的老干部，旁边一般还有美女做陪同！哎~FB啊！房间更有意思，可能是为老干部们设计的，还铺绿色地毯！就一个字“大”，大的都空！！！不过设施齐全！可是这个价钱，住这个地方不划算！！！前台服务态度很不好，可能是我们小两口，一看就知道是来玩的，不知道是不是住错地方了，爱理不理的，真郁闷，当老干部就了不起啊！我们两口子可是自己掏腰包住店，不是公款！！！不过宾馆周边的饭店给满分！除了看我们不会讲广东话欺负我们，别的倒还好，要知道，北京人最热心，也懂礼貌，绝不会这样对吃饭的客人！在此，要提醒去广州一带的北方朋友，一定要学广东话啊，不然只有受气的份！气得我后来都想用英文和他们沟通了！！！,"Haha ~ This hotel is too funny, we have a long distance from Beijing to here, and we only discovered that the whole old cadre is a healing place!There are old cadres who wear suits everywhere, and have a big cadre with a big belly. There are usually beautiful women next to them!Hey ~ FB!The room is more interesting. It may be designed for the veteran cadres, and it is also paved with a green carpet!Just one word ""big"", big one is empty!IntersectionIntersectionBut the facilities are complete!But this price is not cost -effective!IntersectionIntersectionThe attitude of the front desk is very bad.

1,第一感觉就是门童服务很到位，前台服务也面带微笑。房间比较宽敞明亮，上网速度也很快。很满意的一家酒店！,"The first feeling is that Men's service is in place, and the front desk service is smiling.The room is relatively spacious and bright, and the Internet speed is fast.A very satisfied hotel!"
0,真的很差，本来是为了考试离考点近一点才住的，基本上没有服务，房间阴暗一股怪味，本来定的是大床房非说是标准间，总之是一肚子的气，定了两天住了一天就走了。,It's really bad. It was originally staying close to the test point. Basically there was no service.I left for two days and left.

0,房间不大，窗户很小，但是交通比较方便，离汽车站、火车站都只要起步价，性价比不高,"The room is not large, the windows are small, but the traffic is more convenient. As long as the starting price is the starting price, the price is not high"
0,"房间装修差设施也不好,早餐很一般.位置偏僻.","The room decoration is not good, and the breakfast is very average. The location is remote."
0,酒店一般，唯一就是距离机场近，有免费班车，没有特别印象。,"The hotel is generally close to the airport, there are free shuttle, there is no special impression."
0,"房间只能算很一般.设施已经相当陈旧.前台的服务水准有很大的问题.没有预授权,2天的房租需要先结算,还要支付押金.住遍中国及国外那么多酒店,没有遇到这样的事情.地理位置还可以!只是这个价位,在深圳别的选择多的是.以后不会再安排客户住去那里.","The room can only be considered a very general. The facilities are quite old. There are great problems in the service level of the front desk. There is no pre -authorization. The rent of 2 days of rent needs to be settled first, and the deposit must be paid.To such a thing. The geographical location is OK! Just this price, there are many other choices in Shenzhen. In the future, customers will not be arranged to live there."
1,没办法，去烟台没有更多选择。5星级客房里没有熨斗，住了8天，除了送洗或穿起皱的衣服别无选择。海景房除了价格贵外，其它没有什么不同。,"No way, there is no more choice to go to Yantai.There is no iron in the 5 -star room. I lived for 8 days. There is no choice but to send or wear wrinkled clothes.Except for the expensive price of the sea view room, there are no differences in others."
1,价格和设施还是成正比的。这次给客人预定，反映还是不错的。,Price and facilities are still proportional.Booking the guests this time is still good.
1,由于不是本人入住，是朋友住的．酒店好像是新装修过了，所以感觉还不错．性价比比较高．,"Because I did not stay in, my friends lived.The hotel seems to have been renovated, so it feels pretty good.The cost performance is relatively high."
1,环境不错。湖水环绕，又可自由打高尔夫。但就是地方有些难找，提醒携程应同时写上酒店所在的大上海国际高尔夫球场。因为华美达只是其中的一部分。,"The environment is good.Surrounded by lakes, you can be free to fight golf.But it is a bit difficult to find, reminding Ctrip to write the Greater Shanghai International Golf Course where the hotel is located at the same time.Because Huameda is just part of it."
1,整体印象非常好，只是卫生间隔音太差，楼上洗澡发出的哗哗的水声恍若就在眼前。不过卫生间够大，小沙发也很舒服，服务也不错，还是会来住的！补充点评2008年5月18日：如果和如家快捷店去对比，那这里简直就是太超值了，洗澡那比如家强太多了，早餐不但免费，品种和质量比如家好多了，结束的时间也晚（10：00）。走廊宽敞明亮，房间又大，以前我还评价隔音不好，在青岛如家住完对比过后才明白，其实这里隔音效果比如家强多了。坐在这里前台办手续（前台服务员还多），既快又舒适，在如家你得站着七、八分钟办完就不错（前台最多两个服务员）。,"The overall impression is very good, but the sound insulation of the bathroom is too bad.However, the bathroom is big enough, the small sofa is very comfortable, the service is good, and it will still live!Supplementary comment on May 18, 2008: If compared with Rujia Express Store, then it is too valuable here. If you take a shower, you are too strong. Breakfast is not only free. The varieties and quality are much better.Late (10:00).The corridor is spacious and bright, and the room is large. I used to comment that the sound insulation was not good. I realized that after living in Qingdao Rulai, I realized that in fact, the sound insulation effect here is much stronger.Sitting here (there are many waiters at the front desk), it is fast and comfortable. You have to stand for seven or eight minutes at home (two waiters at the front desk at most)."
0,"订房间时说,免费延迟退房至16：00点.但是,完全不可能..延迟退房要收半天房费.","When booking a room, it is said that the check -out check -out freely to 16:00. However, it is completely impossible .. Delayed the check -out for a half -day room fee."
0,太差的酒店，房间设施最多2星。服务人员素质太差，让不是一个房间的人把行李拿走。,"Too bad hotels, room facilities up to 2 stars.The quality of the service personnel is too poor, so that people who are not a room take their luggage away."
1,这是今年第二次入住，上次住的是标间A，这次是标间B，都在无烟层。感觉还可以。标间A的温度可调，标间B不可调而已。,"This is the second time to stay in this year. The last time I lived in the standard room A. This time, the bid B, all in the smokeless layer.It feels okay.The temperature of the bid A can be adjusted, and the bid B is not adjusted."
0,订了商务大床间，可惜房间小的可怜！床和写字台之间太紧，基本上不能转身。更无法忍受的是房间卫生间的异味太重！投诉后，没有任何的解决方案，说空气清新用完了，居然让我开窗通通空气，让人哭笑不得！客人来过都表示气味难闻，很尴尬。房价也严重的性价比不值。早餐就不想提了！强烈建议不要入住！,"I booked a large business bed, but unfortunately the room is small!The bed and the writing desk are too tight, and basically cannot turn around.What is even more unbearable is that the odor of the bathroom in the room is too heavy!After the complaint, there was no solution. It said that the air was finished, and it actually made me open the window to the air, making people cry!The guests have come to say that the smell is unpleasant and embarrassed.House prices are also seriously cost -effective.I don't want to mention breakfast!It is strongly recommended not to stay!"
1,酒店设施虽然有很多创新，但是并不为使用者着想的。窗帘自动开关虽然好，但是却不太好用。还有控制灯、电视、空调等按钮放在一个外置开关。如果在晚上使用这些按钮是非常不方便的。还有毛巾太薄了，吸水性低。早餐不错，前台人员各表现还好。补充点评2007年9月19日：神州行kanghsi评点：交通：方便不方便，出入大出租车，而且东莞的出租车最黑了，动不动就几十，而且都是黑车；**价格：标准间515人民币，符合5星价格；其他酒店消费合理****酒店装修：新酒店，装修风格颜色不大体，不过还是符合5星要求；****酒店设施：按摩健身、游泳池、KTV、各个餐厅餐厅都不错，演艺厅不错，算是酒店特别之处，加分；*****房间用具：毛巾不够厚不是很吸水性、枕头、被子床还算可以；****房间设施：有DVD机，加分，不过房间电器按钮不好用；洗手间设施：洗澡水非常大，大的可怕，有淋浴和浴缸，而且有些房间有电视；*****房间隔音：隔音还可以，但是洗手间水压太大，会比较吵；****房间空间：面积差不多28平米，不符合标准；****上网条件：上网速度可以；****早餐水平：种类、味道都可以；****前台服务：服务员水平可以，主动。****门童服务：出入、下车都主动开门；****,"Although there are many innovations in hotel facilities, they are not thinking for users.Although the curtain automatic switch is good, it is not easy to use.There are also buttons such as light control, TV, air conditioning and other buttons on an external switch.It is very inconvenient to use these buttons at night.The towel is too thin and the water absorption is low.Breakfast is good, and the front desk personnel performed well.Supplementary comment on September 19, 2007: Kanghsi Reviews of Shenzhou Xing: Traffic: convenient and inconvenient, to enter and exit big taxis, and taxis in Dongguan are the darkest, there are dozens of times, and they are all black cars; ** Price: Standard Room 515 515 515RMB, in line with the price of 5 stars; the consumption of other hotels is reasonable **** Hotel decoration: The new hotel, the decoration style is not general, but it still meets the requirements of 5 stars;The restaurant is good, the entertainment hall is good, it is a special place in the hotel, adding points; ***** room utensils: the towel is not thick enough, it is not very absorbent, pillow, quilt beds; **** room facilities: DVD with DVDMachines, bonus points, but the room electrical button is not easy to use; toilet facilities: bathing water is very large, terrible, shower and bathtub, and some rooms have TVs;The water pressure is too large, and it will be more noisy; **** Room space: the area is almost 28 square meters, which does not meet the standard;*** Front desk service: The level of the waiter is OK, take the initiative.**** Gate children service: take the initiative to get in and out of the car; ****"
0,"优点;有电梯(4层开封宾馆连电梯都没有),晚上好像没有小姐电话骚扰(开封宾馆骚扰到最后干脆和按摩小姐电话聊天起来了)缺点;房间象招待所,设备老化,能算3星?价格偏高,性价比不好!门口乱哄哄的,感觉不好!","Advantages; there are elevators (there are no elevators on the 4th floor of the Kaifeng Hotel).

The door is chaotic, it feels bad!"
1,交通方便，房间舒适，服务周到，总体感觉不错。,"Convenient transportation, comfortable rooms, thoughtful service, and generally feel good."
1,性价比较高。服务态度也还行。房间小点。比较难能可贵的是，在火车站附近的宾馆晚上居然都没有骚扰电话！值得表扬！早餐相对简单，一般话。,"The cost is relatively high.The service attitude is okay.The room is small.It is more valuable that there are no harassment calls at night at the hotel near the railway station!commendable!Breakfast is relatively simple, generally."

0,我第一次入住如家，实际情况与现实相差太远，屋子里味道很大，打开窗户换气又很吵，卫生不敢恭维！入住时间不长就搬走。而且位置也很偏，不知道为何在这里选址！总之不会再住！楼下涮肉一般！,"For the first time, I stayed at home. The actual situation was too far from the reality. The taste in the room was very large. When I opened the window to turn my breath, it was very noisy.The check -in time is not long.And the position is also very biased, I don't know why the location is here!In short, I won't live again!The meat shabu downstairs is normal!"
0,很烂的三星级，阴暗。睡个觉而已。马路对面的干锅还可以。不推荐。,"Very rotten Samsung, dark.Sleep just.The dry pot across the road is okay.Not recommended."
1,入住蒋家别墅大床房，设施完善，庭院具有苏州园林的风格，比贝氏做的苏州博物馆强多了！不愧是苏州的“国宾馆”。几点遗憾：1、所谓的大床不是2x2的大床，带个小孩子肯定辛苦；2、中餐厅总是有宴会，动不动就包出去，只好到街上去吃饭。题外话：1、苏州的女孩子好像不会笑，两天下来，整个院子没看到一个女孩子能对客人微笑的，到是男生都很客气；2、几家有名的苏帮菜餐厅好像都是国营的，尤其是北门的那一家，下午一点去，告诉说厨师下班了，第二天再去，满屋的乌烟瘴气，那个女的告诉说到别的地方去吃吧，很不客气。观前街的两家，一家是有最低消费，另一家去晚了就得吃“锅底饭”了。,"Check in the large bed room of the Jiang family villa, complete facilities, and the courtyard has the style of Suzhou gardens. It is much stronger than the Suzhou Museum made by Belish!It is indeed Suzhou's ""State Hotel"".A few regrets: 1. The so -called big bed is not a 2x2 big bed. It must be hard to bring a child; 2. There are always banquets in the Chinese restaurant, and you have to go out and go to the street to eat.Title: 1. The girls in Suzhou don't seem to laugh. After two days, the whole yard did not see a girl who could smile at the guests.They are all state -owned, especially the north gate, go at one o'clock in the afternoon, tell the chef's off -work, go again the next day, the smoke of the house is full of anger, the woman tells it to eat elsewhere.EssenceTwo of Guanqian Street, one has the minimum consumption, and the other has to eat ""pot of pot"" when he goes late."
0,这个酒店太没有职业精神了！等半天打不到一辆taxi，结帐时没给发票……客房条件一般……性价比太低。以后肯定不会再住这酒店。早餐很差，周围环境很差。,"This hotel is too professional!Wait for a long time to play a TAXI, and I did not give the invoice at the checkout ... The conditions for guest rooms ... the price / performance ratio is too low.I will definitely not stay in this hotel in the future.Breakfast is poor and the surrounding environment is poor."
0,真的是很普通的一家酒店，不应该成为在香港的居住选择。因为：1、在一个小巷里，很难找；2、价格奇贵，且房间又小，也就是国内很小的单人间也敢叫标准间；3、前台服务冷漠，老对大陆人翻白眼。,"It is really an ordinary hotel that should not be a residence choice in Hong Kong.Because: 1. In a small alley, it is difficult to find; 2. The price is expensive, and the room is small, that is, the small single room in China dares to call the standard room; 3. The front desk service is indifferent.Essence"
1,"闹中取静,虽然设施旧了一点,但对着黄浦江的房间风景很不错,唯一洗澡的水温还是忽冷忽热,请再检查一下,这个问题比较严重的,特别是小孩洗澡的时候.服务挺好的.宾馆反馈2008年4月16日：首先感谢您对我酒店风景和服务的肯定,酒店的水管会进一步的维护和保养,完善现有硬件设施,谢谢!","Take quiet in the trouble.

Hotel feedback on April 16, 2008: First of all, thank you for your affirmation of the landscape and service of our hotel. The hotel's water pipe will further maintain and maintain, and improve the existing hardware facilities. Thank you!"
1,很不错的酒店。住的8号楼，设施蛮新的，服务态度很好，门童很殷勤，早餐也颇丰富（早餐是我判断宾馆水平的重要标准），在细节上做得比较好，比很多挂牌四星要好。地理位置应该也算不错的。下次去还会住。,"Very good hotel.Building 8, the facilities are quite new, the service attitude is very good, the door children are very diligent, and the breakfast is quite rich (breakfast is an important criterion for judging the level of the hotel).Good.The geographical location should be good.I will live next time."
1,酒店满干净的，前台服务也可以，就是被套的颜色是花的，不是白色的，感觉有点奇怪。早餐味道不太好，品种看似满多，但质量感觉在凑数。不过酒店环境很好，绿化什么都不错，占地面积也挺大的，如果纯粹休闲休闲，也不用去别的景点，在酒店逛逛就行了。,"The hotel is full of cleanliness, and the front desk service is also available. The color of the quilt is flower, not white, it feels a bit strange.The breakfast tastes not very good, the variety seems to be full, but the quality feels.However, the hotel's environment is very good, everything is good, and the area is quite large. If you are pure and leisure, you don't have to go to other attractions. Just go shopping at the hotel."
0,这家酒店的网络简直太差了，耽误了很多工作，换了几个房间，永远发不出邮件，打不开网页。,The network of this hotel is too bad. I have delayed a lot of work. I have changed a few rooms. I can never send out mail and cannot open the webpage.
1,不错的旧点我很喜欢。就是门口太不好了，这次去就住了1个晚上就去太原了，因为这里的飞机实在是少的可怜。没办法。一个人去的又不好玩就走了，但是有机会去的话我还是会住这里的，这里很让我舒服和满意。是我不能够忘记的地方,"I like it very much.It ’s too bad at the door. I went to Taiyuan for one night, because the planes here are really poor.no way.If you go alone, you will leave, but if you have a chance, I will still live here. Here is very comfortable and satisfactory.It's a place I can't forget"
1,"一样的舒适简洁,推荐商务大床房,大挺多的.性价比高","The same comfortable and concise, recommended large -scale business bed room, a lot of high cost performance"
1,酒店新装修过，感觉真的不错，房间不错，前台还有韩语服务，电视也增加了韩国台和日本台，我们韩国同事特别喜欢，他觉得特别方便，让我下次还帮他定这间。唯一欠缺就是前台服务生不是很热情，感觉服务有点生硬。不过总体来说很好，感觉比三星还高一级,"The hotel has been renovated and it feels really good. The room is good. There are Korean services in the front desk. The TV also increases Korean and Japanese. Our Korean colleagues particularly like it.EssenceThe only lack is that the front desk waiter is not very enthusiastic, and feels that the service is a bit hard.But in general, it feels better than Samsung"
1,房间很陈旧，周围环境比较乱，但地理位置还好，离机场大巴上清寺站较近．早餐的品种很少，没什么可吃的．交通较便利．,"The room is very old and the surrounding environment is chaotic, but the geographical location is good, and the airport bus Shangqing Temple Station is closer.There are very few breakfast varieties, and there is nothing to eat.Transportation is more convenient."
1,"地理位置不错,下了高速很快就找到渡假村,去闸坡大约半小时.环境很好,空气清新,房间宽敞舒适!服务态度很差,大多数的服务员都是面无表情,说话冰冷生硬.水上乐园似乎是晚上8点后才开的,玫瑰牛奶浴又贵又不舒服,牛奶味道都没有.按摩也很贵,我们三个人,每个人只按了100分钟,按价格表的价钱,应该是394元,最后买单却是921元,大概收了很多房间费吧!总体感觉还是不错的,下次有时间还可以去玩,但额外收费项目就不敢光顾了.","The geographical location is good.

The service attitude is very poor.Rigid. The water park seems to be opened after 8 pm. Rose milk bath is expensive and uncomfortable. The milk taste is not expensive. The three of us are very expensive. We only press 100 minutes at the price table.It should be 394 yuan, but the last paid is 921 yuan. It takes a lot of room fees! The overall feeling is still good. I can play with time next time, but the additional charging items will not dare to patronize."
1,房间很干净，设施很新，应该是义乌最好的酒店。宾馆反馈2008年4月14日：给您创造一个洁净的居住环境是我们的职责，愿酒店中的每一次都给您留下美好的记忆，谢谢您！,"The room is very clean and the facilities are new. It should be the best hotel in Yiwu.Hotel feedback on April 14, 2008: It is our responsibility to create a clean living environment for you. I hope that every time the hotel will leave you a good memory, thank you!"
1,我买的是“亲子套票”。该酒店的硬件很好！房间的东西很新，而且很干净，不愧是国际品牌！对于楼下所说的那些抱怨问题，本人也碰到了。但都能很好地解决！在此建议大家在出发前多花点时间打电话和酒店预先沟通，就会减少麻烦！还能免费升级到行政楼层的海景房。,"I bought a ""parent -child ticket"".The hotel's hardware is very good!The rooms are new and clean, and it is indeed an international brand!I also encountered those complaints about the complaints described downstairs.But it can be solved well!It is recommended that you spend more time calling before departure to communicate with the hotel in advance, which will reduce trouble!It can also be upgraded to the sea view room on the administrative floor for free."
1,"很喜欢这个酒店,每次都挺满意的.住了五次了都,还介绍了同事去住,大家也都挺蚂蚁的,呵呵补充点评2008年4月25日：就是电梯速度慢了很多,不知道为什么","I like this hotel very much, I am very satisfied every time. I lived five times, and I introduced my colleagues to live. Everyone is quite ants.do not know why"
1,一切还行，就是对通过网络预订的房间为什么就不能灵活一点，半天房都是合情合理的啊，尤其是换住连锁酒店更应该提供方便。,"Everything is okay, why isn't it flexible for the room booking through the Internet? The half -day room is reasonable and reasonable, especially if you change the chain hotel, you should provide convenience."
1,1.交通方便，靠近地铁站；2.安静、干净、舒适；3.价格偏贵（房价、餐饮、上网）。,"1. Convenient transportation, close to subway stations; 2. Quiet, clean, and comfortable; 3. Prices are expensive (housing prices, catering, Internet access)."
1,淮南金茂国际酒店，在淮南应该算是不错的酒店了，房间里茶几上的淮南地图很有特色，给人一种温馨的感觉。地下一层的乒乓球房，设施不错，住店客人每次10元，练练手很好。其它几方面都可以。唯一的不便――地理位置较偏，出去需要打的。好在淮南的出租车起步价4~5元，便宜！,"Huainan Jinmao International Hotel should be considered a good hotel in Huainan. The map of Huainan on the coffee table in the room is very distinctive and gives a warm feeling.The underground table tennis room, the facilities are good, the shop guests are 10 yuan each time, and the practice is very good.Other aspects can be.The only inconvenience -the geographical location is relatively biased, and you need to fight out.Fortunately, the taxi price of Huainan's taxi starts at 4 ~ 5 yuan, cheap!"
1,赚了。我去的路上的士司机就讲这个酒店好。我去的时候房间已满，给我免费升级。并且每天房间都是满房，我就一直占了一周的免费升级便宜。迎宾们也要赞一下的。因为我住的房间是免费升过级的，只能说值，不敢乱说超值。,"made money.The taxi driver on the way to the road will say that this hotel is good.When I went, the room was full, so I upgraded to me for free.And the room is full of rooms every day, and I have always occupied a week for free upgrades.Welcome to praise.Because the room I live is free of charge, I can only say that it is worth, I dare not talk about value."
0,相对来说，比起东莞，深圳的酒店，该酒店服务质量还是略有小疵。略欠热情与礼貌，有点爱搭不理的。举个例子，在该酒店住宿的最后一个晚上，他们忘了给新拖鞋，我总共打了三个电话，才送过来，当时看酒店环境，似乎并不是非常忙碌。,"Relatively speaking, the hotel's service quality is still slightly small compared to the hotel in Dongguan and Shenzhen.Slightly enthusiastic and polite, a little ignorant.For example, on the last night of the hotel's accommodation, they forgot to give the new slippers. I called a total of three calls and sent it. At that time, it didn't seem to be very busy watching the hotel environment."
0,"总体说来,应该是二星级宾馆.因为定的时间比较晚,所以只有这家酒店了.入住时,问前台一些黄山城市的信息,她们说不知道.一个入住也要办理二十几分钟,而且就我们几个人.房间的设施很陈旧,住的也不舒服.","Overall, it should be a two -star hotel. Because the final time is relatively late, only this hotel is. When you stay in, ask some information about some Huangshan cities in the front desk.And just a few of us. The facilities in the room are very old and uncomfortable to live."
1,我感觉还行吧，至少洗衣服务挺快，硬件环境虽然一般，但是毕竟我是考虑离机场比较近，随便住一宿，第二天早上赶飞机，所以，其他一切也就无所谓了,"I feel okay. At least the laundry washing service is very fast. Although the hardware environment is average, after all, I consider that I am closer to the airport. I live in just the next morning."
1,"我是看了携程的推荐选择的该酒店.以往看推荐给我很多帮助.所以这次也把我的感受写下来,希望能给其他人一些帮助.我是四月份入住该酒店的,从大巴车上下来,打车几分种.交通比较方便.房间在新装修的楼层,装修得非常好!居然还有电脑,可以上网,也可以听音乐.楼层的服务员态度非常好.只是有一点不太舒服的,就是前台的服","I read the hotel I chose to choose from Ctrip. I used to recommend me a lot of help in the past. So this time I also wrote my feelings, I hope to give some help to others. I checked into the hotel in April.When you get down the car, a few points to take a taxi. The transportation is more convenient. The room is on the newly renovated floor, and the decoration is very good! There are also computers, you can go online, or you can listen to music. The waiter on the floor is very good. It's just a little bit.Comfortable, that is, the clothes at the front desk"
1,酒店的位置很好，走出去就是松花江畔，如果住靠江边的房间，早点起来推开窗就有机会看到雾凇了。交通也比较方便，从火车站打车过去也就是跳一次表。酒店的设施半新不旧，感觉是老三星级宾馆翻新过的。房间比较大，但是布局不怎么好。淋浴头不够大，总是水量不足的样子。,"The hotel's location is very good. Going out is the bank of the Songhua River. If you live in the room by the river, you will have the opportunity to see the fog.Transportation is also more convenient. Taking a taxi from the railway station is a jump table.The hotel's facilities are half -new, and it feels that it was renovated by the old three -star hotel.The room is relatively large, but the layout is not very good.The shower head is not large enough, and the water is always insufficient."
1,感觉也不算５星，还不如协议的好呢．看来只有我们协议稍微满意点,"It doesn't feel like 5 stars, it's not as good as the agreement.It seems that only our agreement is a little satisfied"
1,住了3天，地点不错，环境也很舒适，价格合理，还有早餐，虽然不丰盛，但比没有强，旁边就有超市，对面快餐饭店还比较多，对面网吧配置一般，人多有时还找不到位置。下次去还住这！,"After staying for 3 days, the location is good, the environment is very comfortable, the price is reasonable, and there are breakfast. Although it is not rich, it is better than no. There are supermarkets next to it. There are more fast food restaurants on the other side.Can't find the location.Go to live here next time!"
1,有很长时间没有在西藏大厦住了，以前去北京在这里住的较多。这次住进来发现换了液晶电视，但网络不是很好，他们自己说是收费的原因造成的。其它还好。,"I have n’t lived in the Tibet Building for a long time, and I used to live here in Beijing a lot.This time I came in and found that I changed the LCD TV, but the Internet was not very good. They said that it was caused by the reason for the charge.Others are okay."
1,酒店房间还可以，床也比较舒服。空调声音很小，完全没有感觉，不过温度实在太低，我调到26度还是感觉很冷。卫生间比较小。服务员在请勿打扰的情况下还会敲门询问是否要洗衣物或打扫。交通很方便，到火车站才6元。结帐速度还比较快，打车也很方便。,"The hotel room is okay, and the bed is more comfortable.The sound of the air conditioner is very small and there is no feeling at all, but the temperature is too low. I still feel very cold when I adjust it to 26 degrees.The bathroom is relatively small.When the waiter should not disturb, he will knock on the door to ask if he wants to laundry or clean.The transportation is very convenient. It is only 6 yuan to the train station.The checkout speed is relatively fast, and the taxi is also very convenient."
1,房间尚可，浴室有点小，服务也还可以，可是为什么checkout的时候不主动提供发票？甚至提醒一声都没有？,"The room is okay, the bathroom is a bit small, and the service is okay, but why do you not take the initiative to provide an invoice when you checkout?Even reminded not to say nothing?"

1,第二次入住了，酒店有免费接机的服务，坐到车上后还有免费的冰镇饮料喝。酒店的服务员很友好，不管哪个部门的，看到你都会主动微笑问候。客房的设施略显陈旧，客房内没有保险箱，电视机是很老式的21寸球形显像管，大床还是很舒服的，我住的豪华单人间有14扇窗，拉窗帘就要花两分钟，房间面积很大。卫生间的换气扇和顶灯是同一个开关，但是洗澡的时候开着换气扇会觉得有些冷，建议分成两个开关。早餐很丰富，第一天入住还有果盘送。附近就是白鹭洲，走过去只要十分钟，去散散步，风景很好。虽然硬件设置欠缺一些，但下次肯定还是会再住的。,"The second time I stayed, the hotel had a free pick -up service, and there was a free iced drink to drink after taking the car.The hotel's waiter is very friendly. No matter which department, you will take the initiative to smile.The facilities of the guest rooms are slightly old. There are no safe in the guest room. The TV is very old 21 -inch spherical image tube. The large bed is still very comfortable. I live in the luxury single room. There are 14 windows.The area is large.The air -changing fan and the top lights in the bathroom are the same switch, but when you take a bath, you will feel a little cold when you turn on the air -changing fan. It is recommended to divide into two switches.Breakfast is very rich, and there is a fruit plate for the first day.Nearby is Bailizhou. It only takes ten minutes to walk over to go for a walk. The scenery is very good.Although the hardware settings are lacking, they will definitely live again next time."
1,环境还是很好的，附近是老城区了，但觉得,"The environment is still very good, there are old town nearby, but I think"
0,"外观脏兮兮的,坐机场大巴路过时,还不知道自己住的就是这间如家,心里还说这么破啊.下了大巴走过来,才发现自己要住这里,555.订的是180一间的商务大床间,不算便宜了,但是房间很小,设施感觉旧旧的.我住过很多连锁酒店了,如家也住过很多次,唉,发现如家是一家不如一家啊!遗憾.唯一方便的就是离重庆机场大巴站很近,第二天坐大巴很方便哦.补充点评2007年12月23日：对了,房间还有异味.我也觉得这已经是如家的习惯的.在深圳的如家也是有异味的.以后我想考虑别的连锁酒店了.住了成都的七斗星,感觉好很多!","The appearance is dirty. When I was passing by the airport bus, I did n’t know that what I lived in was like a home, and I said it was so broken. After I came over when I came over, I found that I was going to live here.The big business bed room is not cheap, but the room is small, and the facilities feel old. I have lived in many chain hotels, and I have lived many times. I found that the family is not as good as one! Unfortunately.The only convenient thing is that it is very close to the bus from Chongqing Airport. It is very convenient to take a bus the next day. Add comments on December 23, 2007: By the way, the room still has a odor. I also think this is already a home.Shenzhen's home also has a odor. In the future, I want to think about other chain hotels. I lived in the seven -fighting star who lived in Chengdu, and it feels much better!"
1,一个多月前去住过，现在去发现新装修过了，看得出他们很努力，支持一下！,"I went to live more than a month ago, and now I found new renovations. I can see that they are working hard and support!"
1,不错，在同等档次酒店中应该是值得推荐的！,"Yes, it should be recommended in the same -grade hotels!"
1,"辰光在邢台还算是不错的酒店,起码比邢台宾馆强了不少.虽说离4星标准还有不小的差距,但是对于邢台这个经济不发达地区就算不错的了.地理位置一般,距离火车站打车8元,交通还算方便,但是不够繁华.房间还算整洁,客房服务业比较及时.宾馆晚上10点到早6点设置免骚扰电话功能,很人性化.隔音比较好,有一个良好的睡觉环境.","Chen Guang is still a good hotel in Xingtai, at least a lot stronger than Xingtai Hotel.

The room is quite clean, and the room service industry is relatively timely. The hotel is set up from 10 pm to 6 am.Sleeping environment."
0,无论硬件、软件都非常令人失望的一家酒店。看了前面朋友们的评论，本不愿入住这家屯河华美达的，但由于旅游旺季订房不易的原因，只得前来。入住一晚即离开，建议朋友们不要随便来尝试了。该店大堂偏狭。房间面积不小，但家具少且残旧，感觉清冷空荡。地毯较脏，装修暗旧。洗手间小，浴具洁具颜色陈脏，毛巾邋遢。电视节目奇少。服务意识极差，前台和大堂副理态度倨傲、俾睨房客，且争风好辩。接线生宛若生手，答非所问。仅门童主动为客户拿行李，尚显敬业。早餐的感觉像在招待所一般。向来该酒店内部缺少培训，上下人员完全没有以客为尊的思想。不知道华美达在中国的品牌管理是由什么人操作的。根本够不上四星，听说比起三星的新融大厦也要差一截。也望携程能够加强调研，多为客户提供更加准确的信息。,"A hotel that is very disappointing regardless of hardware and software.After reading the comments from friends in front, I was unwilling to stay in this Tun River Hua Mida, but because of the difficulty of reservation in the tourist season, I had to come.I left one night, and I suggest friends not to try it casually.The lobby of the shop is narrow.The room is not small, but the furniture is small and the old, and it feels cold and empty.The carpet is dirty and the decoration is dark.The bathroom is small, the color of the bathtime sanitary ware is Chen Dan, and the towels are sloppy.There are few TV shows.The awareness of service is extremely poor.The wiring is like a hand, answering the question.Men -child alone took the luggage for customers, and it was still dedicated.The feeling of breakfast seems to be in the guest house.The hotel has always lacked training inside the hotel, and the people up and down have no ideas of respecting guests.I don't know who Himaida's brand management in China is operated.It is not enough for four stars. I heard that it is worse than Samsung's Xinrong Building.I also hope that Ctrip can strengthen surveys and provide customers with more accurate information."
1,上周日1月28日晚我的客人到酒店后前台尽然不知道定过房。预定使用了我和客人的名字，服务员查询后后，证实有过预定。,"On the evening of January 28, my guests arrived at the front desk of the hotel without knowing the house.The names of my and my guests are scheduled. After the waiter inquires, it is confirmed that there have been reservations."
1,这是第二次入住此酒店了，感觉酒店总体比较好，服务生档次层次不齐，有的很有礼貌，有的根本当没你这个人~~~房间没冰箱是一个比较遗憾的地方,"This is the second time to stay in this hotel. It feels that the hotel is generally better, the waiter's grade level is not uniform, and some are very polite."
1,"入住这家挂牌四星酒店,与三年前感觉明显高了几个档次,大堂温馨,客房也不一样了,新改造的餐厅风格很不错,我很喜欢.服务员的微笑如浴春风,随时都有问候.性价比挺高,值得推荐.","Staying in this list of four -star hotels, it is obviously a few grades from three years ago, the lobby is warm, the guest rooms are not the same. The newly modified restaurant style is very good. I like it very much.There are greetings. The cost performance is quite high, it is worth recommending."
1,我定的是豪华客房，看了之前的点评，实际去到还是比想象中的好，房间较大和干净，装修也比较有特色．,"I set me a luxury room. After reading the previous reviews, it is better to go to imagination. The room is relatively large and clean, and the decoration is more distinctive."
1,订了标准间，给了368的房间，感觉还不错，早餐挺丰富。,The standard room was booked and gave 368 rooms. It felt pretty good and had a rich breakfast.

1,一个还不错的酒店。优点有这样几条。一是交通方便。离地铁和公交车站都只5分钟以内。步行至天安门也只15分钟。地点也不难找，我是第一次去，路都没问就找到了。二是房间干净，由于是好象是新装修的，所以房间整洁干净，而且也没有传说中的异味，呵呵，也许是硝烟散尽？浴室的24小时的热水有保障。第三么，服务态度还不错，早饭也还说得过去。油条的确还可以，往往一上来就一抢而空。不足么，就是服务台的灵活性还不够,"A good hotel.There are a few advantages.The first is convenient transportation.It is only within 5 minutes from the subway and bus stations.It is only 15 minutes walking to Tiananmen.The location is not difficult to find. I went for the first time, and I found it without asking.The second is that the room is clean, because it seems to be newly renovated, so the room is neat and clean, and there is no legendary odor. Hehe, maybe it is the smoke scattered?The 24 -hour hot water in the bathroom is guaranteed.Third, the service attitude is not bad, and the breakfast is still over.The fritters are indeed okay, and it is often emptied as soon as it comes up.Is it not enough, that is, the flexibility of the service desk is not enough"
1,"武昌的住宿首选!一切都很完美,性价比高,要是协议单位就更好了补充点评2008年8月3日：地毯已经更换了",Wuchang's accommodation is the first choice! Everything is perfect and cost -effective.
1,房间比较干净，服务一般，交通还可以，就是门口的服务生差了一点，由于我们的车停在靠外一点，他看我们一下，也不管我们大包小包的，自己反而走开了。,"The room is relatively clean, the service is average, and the traffic is okay. The waiter at the door is a bit worse. Since our car is parked a little more than a little more, he sees us, regardless of our big bags or small bags, but go away."
0,酒店房间没有桌子第一次遇到竟然还有蜘蛛吓了我一跳房间设备比较老,"For the first time in the hotel room, there was a spider that scared me. The equipment was older."
0,这酒店真的不咋样，一进房间，就闻到一股地毯发出的异味，晚上睡觉时，房间弥漫着一股厕所的异味（估计是中央空调的送风口送出来的），很是难受，我住了两天只好仓惶而逃。而且通过携程预定明明可以免费升级至豪华间，但酒店只是升至商务间，和酒店交涉，酒店前台人员居然说豪华间还不如商务间（豪华间518，商务间才458），那岂不是自打嘴巴，订豪华间的客人岂不都是傻子？总之，郁闷！,"This hotel is really not good. As soon as I entered the room, I smelled the smell from a carpet. When I was sleeping at night, the room was filled with a smell of the toilet (it is estimated that it was sent out by the central air conditioner's air outlet). It was very uncomfortable.I had to fled for two days.And through Ctrip's scheduled, it can be upgraded to a luxury room for free, but the hotel just rises to a business room and negotiates with the hotel. The front desk staff of the hotel actually says that the luxury room is not as good as the business room (luxury room 518, business room only 458).Highs, isn't it all fools who order the luxury rooms?In short, depressed!"
1,不错，，服务也可以，停车场，，等比较周到补充点评2008年1月24日：准备第二次入住了，，订好了，，因为第一次感觉还可以,"Yes, the service is okay, the parking lot, the comparative replenishment comment on January 24, 2008: I prepare for the second time to stay, and I order it, because the first time I feel it is okay"
0,我是8日晚上入住假日酒店的，说真的，印象糟透了，这个四星级的酒店整体感觉却连三星级的标准都没有。我住的是8楼，进入房间后，只能用一个字来形容：热、热、热…简直跟蒸桑拿似的，调空调，也没用，后来索性关掉了，但感觉还是闷，于是整晚就开着窗户睡觉。酒店取电卡的设置也是非常的糟糕，插了足足有２０秒才来电，而且更让人受不了的是第二天我们出去回来后插了下，又不来电，于是我们自己叫服务员过来帮忙，没想到服务员竟然说：“你们没有把取电卡插到最里面。”咳！天啊！是我们不会用？还是设置的有问题？酒店表现出让我受不了的小气，卫生间的牙膏用量太太太少了，在我看来，只有一个晚上的用量，更令人头痛的是水龙头的冷热水标识竟然是错误的，明明标的是热水出来的却是冷水，浴室的下水道不通畅，下水很慢，第二次洗澡还有积水，真是让人觉得挺不舒服的。酒店的早餐也不怎么样，服务员一点都不主动，我在明档要了一碗馄饨和一个煎鸡蛋，他们都站在那里傻傻的没有反映，直到我自己叫服务员，他们才送来，而且早餐的水果不新鲜，橘子好多都是烂的。唯一让我们值得庆幸的是大堂吧有一个菲律宾的乐队。还有一件让我们觉得震惊的事情那就是当晚１１点的时候我出去了一趟，忽然窜出一个人飞快地把前面一女的包抢了，顿时我都惊呆了，太可怕了！作为一家四星级的高档酒店，这里的治安太乱了！！！提及此事，别无他意，只是提醒各位，真的要小心！！！,"I stayed at the Holiday Hotel on the evening of the 8th.I live in the 8th floor. After entering the room, I can only use one word to describe: heat, heat, heat ... just like steamed sauna, air conditioning, it is useless, but it was turned off, but I still feel stuffy.So I opened the window all night to sleep.The setting of the hotel's electricity card is also very bad. After inserting 20 seconds to call, it is even more unbearable. The next day we went back and inserted it, so we called the waiter to come over ourselves.Help, I didn't expect the waiter to say, ""You did not insert the electric card to the innermost."" Cough!Oh my god!Do we not use it?Or is there a problem with it?The hotel shows the stingy stubborn that I can't stand it. The amount of toothpaste in the bathroom is too small. In my opinion, there is only one night of dosage. What is more headache is that the hot and cold water logo of the faucet is wrong.The water comes out of cold water. The sewer in the bathroom is not smooth. The water is very slow. The second bath and the stagnant water are really uncomfortable.The hotel's breakfast is not very good. The waiter is not active at all. I asked a bowl of ravioli and a fried egg in the open file. They all stood there and did not reflect it. They were not sent until I called the waiter.And the fruits of breakfast are not fresh, and many oranges are rotten.The only thing that makes us fortunate is that there is a Philippine band in the lobby.Another thing that made us feel shocked was that I went out at 11 o'clock that night. Suddenly, a person quickly grabbed the bag of the woman in front of me. I was shocked. It was terrible!As a four -star high -end hotel, the law and order here is too messy!IntersectionIntersectionWhen it comes to this matter, there is no other intention, just remind you that be careful!IntersectionIntersection"
1,"酒店的外部环境很好,绿树成荫,楼与楼之间有点远,不过这才是别墅的特色,去餐厅有一点点远(我们住5号楼),大概要步行7,8分钟,但是很有散步的乐趣,餐厅的菜不错,价格也可以,红烧肉很好吃(38元一份),土鸡一般.早餐15元也算比较值了,蒸饺和炒面味道都不错.房间有点旧,不过作为三星也算是正常了,套房就是有个厅,但是床是小床,不是很喜欢还有现在搞活动所谓用餐消费满100送30元抵用券,实在不过是个噱头,有非常多的限制,满心欢喜以为可以抵一些房费或者早餐,但最终均被告知不可以,只可以租用网球场,乒乓室什么的,因没有使用,所以不知道真去换的时候是否又有别的限制.总之来说还是去佘山值得入住的酒店.","The outside environment of the hotel is very good, the green trees are shaded, and the building is a bit far away, but this is the characteristics of the villa. There is a little far away from the restaurant (we live in Building 5).But very fun to take a walk, the restaurant's dishes are good, the price is also fine, the braised pork is delicious (38 yuan a copy), the native chicken is generally valuable. The taste of steamed dumplings and fried noodles is good. The room is the room.It is a bit old, but it is normal to be Samsung. There is a hall in the suite, but the bed is a small bed. I do n’t like it. I do n’t like it. I do n’t like it. I do n’t like it. I do n’t like it.There are many restrictions, I am full of joy that I can get some housing fees or breakfast, but in the end I was told that it was not possible. I could only rent a tennis court, table tennis room or something.Limited. In short, I still go to the hotel worth checking in."
1,酒店很清静，是典型的商务住宿选择，早餐不是自助而是套餐也很有特色，主要在天津干道边交通还算方便。没有娱乐设施，喜欢热闹的不应该住在这里。,"The hotel is very quiet. It is a typical business accommodation choice. Breakfast is not a self -service but a package. It is also very convenient to traffic on the side of Tianjin.Without entertainment facilities, those who like lively should not live here."

1,酒店在当地来说还是可以的，位置也不错。餐厅吃饭价格偏高了一点，网络不是很稳定，老是断断续续，经常上网的不是很爽！,"The hotel is still available locally, and the location is good.The price of the restaurant is a bit higher, the network is not very stable, the Internet is always intermittent, and it is not very cool to go online!"
1,酒店的房间很不错，大。就是缺点明亮的阳光。隔音效果稍微差了些。,"The hotel's room is very good, big.It is the disadvantage of bright sunshine.The sound insulation effect is slightly worse."
1,交通很方便，从罗湖火车站直接可以坐地铁去，在世界之窗站下一出站就是了。房间很干净，阳台也比较大。最喜欢就是里面的游泳池，很有威尼斯的特色，小朋友去就很喜欢了。checkin和checkout的时候有很新鲜的苹果吃，呵呵，感觉很舒服！,"The transportation is very convenient. You can take the subway directly from the Luohu Railway Station.The room is clean and the balcony is relatively large.The favorite is the swimming pool inside. It has the characteristics of Venice. Children like it very much.When Checkin and Checkout, there are very fresh apples to eat, haha, it feels very comfortable!"
0,总台服务还可以，房间实在不怎么样，空调很吵，床居然是一边高一边低的，这个房价实在是不值得，下次不会选择。,The service of the main station is okay. The room is not very good. The air conditioner is very noisy. The bed is actually high and low. This house price is really not worth it. It will not choose next time.
0,"本来对这家酒店的印象不错的,但临走时却有些生气;门口的15:20的机场大巴等到15:40都没有来,酒店也没有提前预告,只好打车去机场;提醒各位,坐酒店门口的机场大巴要谨慎,经常会无故取消的;","I was already impressed by this hotel, but I was a little angry when I left; the airport bus at 15:20 at the door did not come until 15:40, and the hotel did not preview it in advance, so I had to take a taxi to the airport; remind you, take the hotel door at the door of the hotelThe airport bus must be cautious, and often cancel it for no reason;"
0,差到一定程度了不如一个好的二星或没星的宾馆呢,It's not as bad as a good two -star or no star hotel.
0,前台服务态度挺好。但酒店设施较简单陈旧，感觉连二星的都比不上，房间隔音效果也不好，外面卡拉ok的声音听的清清楚楚，晚上要是失眠了可以听听歌。宾馆反馈2007年10月30日：尊敬的宾客：非常感谢您的光临及提出宝贵的意见，本酒店目前的房间设施设备是以简约时尚为前提，关于隔音改造工程正在完善中，相信我们会以更优质的服务和舒适的客房、便利的商务环境，迎接您的再次光临！,"The front desk service attitude is very good.However, the hotel facilities are relatively old and old. It feels that even the two stars are not as good as the two stars. The sound insulation effect of the room is not good. The sound of karaoke outside is clear. If you insomnia at night, you can listen to songs.Hotel feedback on October 30, 2007: Dear guest: Thank you very much for your coming and put forward valuable opinions. The current room facilities and equipment of the hotel are based on simple and fashion.High -quality services and comfortable rooms, convenient business environment, welcome your visit again!"
1,"酒店的位置到是不错,就是早餐不太好.房间的服务也可以,就是晚上的骚扰电话太多.我入住的时间正好是糖酒会期间,所以价格偏高,价格要是在190含早的标价还是不错的.补充点评2007年10月13日：对了,看到有人反映前台的服务,差点忘记点评.前台的服务是不好,又慢又不热情.","The location of the hotel is good, that is, the breakfast is not good. The service of the room is also possible, that is, there are too many harassment calls at night. The time for me to stay is exactly the period of the sugar and wine party, so the price is high.The price is still good. Supplementary comment on October 13, 2007: By the way, see someone reflect the service of the front desk, almost forget the review. The service of the front desk is not good, slow and not enthusiastic."
0,我是2月13号左右去的，定了一间大床房，在一楼，味道很浓的，像走进了胡同，12x房，有个窗子很小，连洗澡的拖鞋都没有，只有一双纸质拖鞋，我打了2次电话到前台，也没给送，最后我找到前台，服务员说他们没有洗澡的拖鞋，我只有从房间服务员那里又要了一双纸质拖鞋留洗澡，我们一家三口倒换着用（我孩子4岁）。有桌子，但不提供凳子，只能做床上打电脑。剩下的用的东西几乎没有：吹风机，电熨斗，。。。。。，感觉很不方便。一早起来走人，永远都不会在去这家酒店。,"I went around February 13th. I set a large bed room. On the first floor, the taste was very strong. It was like entering the alley, room 12x, and a window was very small.A pair of paper slippers, I called twice to the front desk, and I didn't give it. In the end, I found the front desk. The waiter said that they did not take a bathing slippers. I only asked a pair of paper slippers from the room waiter to take a bath.The three mouths are replaced (my child is 4 years old).There are tables, but do not provide stools. You can only make a computer on the bed.There are almost no remaining things: hair dryer, electric iron.EssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceIt feels inconvenient.Get up early in the morning and will never go to this hotel."
1,我们一行8人订了两件海景豪华间和一间豪华标间，无意间我们一家住进了2104房间，景色真不错，不但可以看到大海，还可以看到市景，夜景也不错。房间真大，干净整洁，设施齐全。不足之处是窗户玻璃有点脏，窗户只能撑开一点，窗边的天花板有漏水现象，进去的时候已经放了两个盆在接水，还有浴室的龙头太高了，花洒不能调节，水散的太开了。周边环境也很好，吃饭购物都方便地，酒店旁边一家台湾风味的餐馆味道蛮好的。总体来说还是很满意的，有机会再来威海的话还要住这里在。,"Our group of 8 people ordered two luxury rooms and a luxury room. Inadvertently, our family lived in Room 2104. The scenery was really good. Not only can we see the sea, but also the city view, the night view is also good.The room is really large, clean and tidy, and the facilities are complete.The disadvantage is that the window glass is a bit dirty, and the window can only be opened. The ceiling by the window is leaked. When you enter, two pots have been put in water. The leader of the bathroom is too high. The shower cannot be adjusted.The scattered water is too open.The surrounding environment is also very good, and it is convenient to eat and shop. A Taiwanese restaurant next to the hotel tastes pretty good.Generally speaking, I am very satisfied. If you have the opportunity to come to Weihai again, you have to live here."
1,房间整洁，干净，携程价位不算高。周边环境一流，是个修身养性的好地方。,"The room is clean and clean, and the price of Ctrip is not high.The surrounding environment is first -class and is a good place for self -cultivation."
1,非常好的酒店，无论是服务、设施还是交通、位置等都很方便，很多客人都会指定来这个酒店,"Very good hotels, whether it is service, facilities, transportation, location, etc."
1,虽然该酒店确实是当地（大角湾）最好的酒店，设施应该算刚刚达到四星标准了，但是服务就有点名不符实了，顶多达到三星（主要是指有些服务无法提供，能提供的服务倒是不错）。而最不满意的是靠沙滩为卖点的酒店，竟然无法直接进入沙滩，使我们对酒店的印象大打折扣。,"Although the hotel is indeed the best hotel in the local area (Dagiao Bay). The facilities should be considered just reaching the four -star standard, but the service is a bit inconsistent.The service is good).The most dissatisfied is the hotel that rely on the beach as the selling point, which could not enter the beach directly, which greatly reduced our impression of the hotel."
1,非常不错的酒店，房间宽大，浴室的设计都不错，只是房间里的酒水设备不足。我从加州带来几瓶很好的红酒，可是没有杯子，不过酒店马上就送过来。客房，门房的服务都很好。在大连的五星酒店里这家的价格合理（可是还是比我在北京住的五星酒店贵）。我住过大连其它的五星酒店，这家日光比较划算。,"A very good hotel, the room is wide, and the bathroom design is good, but the wine equipment in the room is insufficient.I brought a few bottles of good red wine from California, but there was no cup, but the hotel came over immediately.The service of the guest rooms and the door of the door is very good.The price of this five -star hotel in Dalian is reasonable (but it is still more expensive than the five -star hotel I live in Beijing).I have lived in other five -star hotels in Dalian, and this daylight is more cost -effective."
0,"NND!才迟半个小时退房就收我半天的房费！而且也不提前打电话来通知一下！退房时掉了东西在房里他们也不会帮你找的！房间臭死了！离外滩远得要死打的要３０块！以后也不会住这个烂酒店了！ＭＤ,气！","NND!

0,"千万不要住综合楼,那本来真的是一个宗和楼,在路边,且在景区大门外,跟一个路边酒店没区别.另,之前看点评说那里的温泉少,服务差,还不信,体验的结果是:服务员说,来多少客人开多少池.结果我们一群人在一个池里,好在小朋友不介意,但我介意,这是广东省最差的温泉.唯一的优点:综合楼改成的客房面积很大.","Do not live in the comprehensive building. It was really a Zonghe Building. It was no different from a roadside hotel outside the gate of the road. In addition, the previous reviews said that there were fewer hot springs there, the service was poor, and the service was poor.If you do n’t believe it, the result of the experience is: the waiter said, how many guests come to open. As a result, a group of us group is in a pool. Fortunately, the children do n’t mind, but I mind, this is the worst hot spring in Guangdong Province.The area of the room changed into a large area is very large."
1,如果在遂宁这座小城里寻找温馨的家，明星康年是我首要选泽，因为她确实给人以温暖，给人以安宁，给人以留连。可以说，我是看着她成长起来的，从几年前第一天开张，到现在的逐渐成熟，都给人留下了深刻的印象。当然，目前还有不足（客人停车过夜收费、长途还不能免费），我相信，随着她的进一步成长，她将变得尽善尽美，这也是我对她的祝福！,"If you look for a warm home in the small town of Suining, Star Kangnian is my first choice, because she does give people warmth, gives peace, and gives people to stay.It can be said that I watched her grow up. From the first day of the year before, and gradually maturing now, it has left a deep impression.Of course, there are currently insufficient (guests parking overnight and long distances cannot be free). I believe that with her further growth, she will become perfect, which is my blessing to her!"
0,"电话服务生说装修已经一年了,当时住的时候就两个月左右,装修味太浓,呛的眼泪鼻子一大把的,而且前台服务员说他们的打折价比携程便宜,不知道这算不算房价倒挂???地段太偏,餐厅的饭菜味道不怎么样","The phone waiter said that the decoration has been one year. When I lived at that time, it was about two months. The decoration taste was too strong, and the tears of tears were a lot, and the front desk waiter said that their discount price is cheaper.Not counting house prices upside down ??? List is too biased, the food in the restaurant is not good"
1,很一般的五星级酒店，周边的环境感觉很乱,"Very ordinary five -star hotel, the surrounding environment feels messy"
1,酒店的基本设施一般，但服务态度确实很不错，房间8楼以下就是新装修的，8楼的房间就比较成旧，洗澡有单独的整体浴室，水比较大空调的风也很足，这个宾馆好像是属于海军的南海舰队，地理位置也很好，靠近省委火车站，离黄兴步行街也就三站地，值得入住,"The basic facilities of the hotel are average, but the service attitude is really good. The new decoration is below the 8th floor of the room. The room on the 8th floor is relatively old. The bathing room has a separate bathroom.It seems that the South China Sea fleet belongs to the Navy, and the geographical location is also very good. It is close to the Provincial Party Committee Railway Station."
1,总体上挺不错的!环境很好，服务也不错。,Overall it is good! The environment is very good and the service is good.
1,那里的环境很好，只是价格有点贵，打车需要走一段路，自己驾车的话较方便，服务态度很好．,"The environment there is very good, but the price is a bit expensive. It takes a while to take a taxi. It is more convenient to drive by yourself and the service attitude is very good."
1,除了地段好之外，其他没有一样好的。宽带慢得像蜗牛，他们居然说就是这样。大堂和客房是在不同楼里，我登记后要拿行李出门去旁边的楼坐电梯。早餐也配五星酒店？吃得像农村一样。以后不会住的。,"Except for the good location, nothing else is the same.Broadband is like snails, they actually said that.The lobby and guest rooms are in different buildings. After registering, I have to take my luggage and go out to the elevator next to the building.Breakfast with a five -star hotel?Eat like rural areas.I won't live in the future."
1,跟同一条街不远的经济型酒店比较我更喜欢假日之星酒店我订的是商务大床房相比房间面积大一点感觉不那么狭窄还有浴室提供吹风机另家经济型酒店同类房间里也没有缺点：大部分经济型酒店不提供早餐还有就是房间的隔音效果做的不是很好神经衰弱的不建议入住,"Compared with the Economic Hotels not far from the same street, I prefer the Holiday Star Hotel. I booked a large business bed room. Compared with the room area, it feels less narrow and the bathroom provides a hair dryer.No disadvantages: Most economy hotels do not provide breakfast, and there is the sound insulation effect of the room."
0,地理位置是公认的不错，但是缺点也不少，主要是电梯慢，走廊狭窄，房间设施有些陈旧了，临时住一晚可以，时间长了不建议入住。,"The geographical location is well -known, but there are many disadvantages, mainly because the elevator is slow, the corridor is narrow, and the room facilities are a little old. It is possible to live temporarily for one night. It is not recommended to check in after a long time."
1,还不错，南充少有的几个环境不错的酒店了闹中取静的酒店，价格也合理，服务质量不错：）,It's not bad. Several of the rare hotels in Nanchong have good hotels to get quiet hotels. The price is reasonable and the service quality is good :)
1,位置很好，就在南京路步行街后面，逛街购物很方便，然后离人民广场地铁站也近，交通很方便。,"The location is very good. Just behind Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street, shopping is very convenient, and then it is close to the People's Square Metro Station. The transportation is very convenient."
0,隔音实在太差，隔壁房间人睡觉打呼的声音你都能听见，就象在你耳边一样，一个晚上都没睡好，晕～实在差强人意，下次不会再住了！,"The sound insulation is too bad. You can hear the sound of people who sleep and snoring in the next room, just like in your ears, I haven't slept well all night, dizzy ~ It's not unsatisfactory, I won't live again next time!"
1,广元现在最好的酒店，各方面条件都不错，下次还会入主。,"Guangyuan's best hotel now has good conditions in all aspects, and will still be in the next time."
1,酒店内外环境布置有特色，各项休闲娱乐设施较全。西餐厅的早餐和晚餐不错，同行的朋友是内行，给予肯定的评价。晚间在花园内执勤的保安看到我们要沿湖散步，一边有礼貌地在旁陪同，还能很好地回答我们对酒店的提问，看得出他对工作的投入与酒店的培训。前台办理入住手续的小姐应对也很得体。洗手间的下水不是很通畅；朋友的房间灯不亮，要求修理，等返回后，灯修好了，但是房间内留下了烟味；没有做夜床。,"The inside and outside of the hotel has characteristics, and all leisure and entertainment facilities are relatively complete.Breakfast and dinner in Western restaurants are good. Friends who are traveling are internally and given a positive evaluation.In the evening, the security guards in the garden saw that we were walking along the lake and accompanied them politely. We could also answer our questions about the hotel and see his investment in work and the training of hotels.The lady who checked in at the front desk is also very decent.The launch of the bathroom is not very smooth; the friends of the friend's room are not on, and they are required to repair it. After returning, the lights are repaired, but there is a smell of smoke in the room; there is no night bed."
1,酒店总体还是不错的。比较上次住的太平洋，差不多的价格硬件设施明显好很多。早餐还是一般般。最受不了的是居然只接受银联信用卡，国外的客人一律付现金...,"The hotel is generally good.Compared with the Pacific Ocean that lived last time, almost the same price hardware facilities were significantly better.Breakfast is still the same.The most unbearable is that I only accept UnionPay credit cards, and foreign guests all pay cash ..."
1,房间内的家具确实够老了，而且被子有的地方没弄干净。但总体来说服务不错，前台小姐很热情，虽然出了点小问题。早餐还是比较丰富的，但显然是给外国人准备的。中餐元素太少。不过看老外的架势，我们以后一定要吃好早餐啊！宾馆反馈2008年7月14日：尊敬的宾客：您好！烟台中心大酒店非常感谢您对酒店提出的宝贵意见，并将完善好酒店每一个服务细节，期待您的再次光临！,"The furniture in the room is really old, and the place where the quilt is not clean.But in general, the service is good, and the front desk lady is very enthusiastic, although there are some small problems.Breakfast is still relatively rich, but it is obviously prepared for foreigners.There are too few Chinese food elements.But looking at the posture of foreigners, we must eat breakfast in the future!Hotel feedback on July 14, 2008: Dear guest: Hello!Thank you very much for your valuable opinions on the hotel, and you will improve every service details of the hotel. Looking forward to your visit again!"
1,整体的标准没有达到五星级，前台的工作效率比较慢。地理位置还不错，比较好找，酒店的早茶还不错。补充点评2008年5月26日：写错了，是四星级,"The overall standard does not reach five -star, and the work efficiency of the front desk is relatively slow.The geographical location is not bad, it is better to find it. The hotel's early tea is not bad.Supplementary comment on May 26, 2008: I wrote the wrong, it is a four -star level"
0,第一次评价。为什么呢。因为该酒店结算的时候多收了我50元钱。说是消费了：一把刮刀15元，另外35元是保健品。可是，苍天为证，我根本就没有用过那所谓的保健品。当时退房时也没有过多和他理论。让前台算就算进去好了，可是一再强调没有用过。前台MM还好，说要确认一下，不然不能乱收你钱的。确认了一下，服务员还是说没有掉了。呵呵，真是见鬼了。补充点评2008年6月9日：补充一下。酒店的隔音很差。门里门外，没有区别。然后性价比还是有的。当然也有好的一面。大家可以入住。,"The first evaluation.why.Because the hotel collected me 50 yuan more when the settlement was settled.It is said that it is consumed: a scraper is 15 yuan, and the other 35 yuan is health products.However, Cang Tian has not used that so -called health care products at all.At that time, there was no too much theory with him when checking out.Even if the front desk is calculated, it has repeatedly emphasized that it has not been used again.The front desk MM is okay. If you want to confirm it, you can't collect your money.After confirming, the waiter still said that it did not drop.Hehe, it's really a ghost.Supplementary comment on June 9, 2008: Add it.The sound insulation of the hotel is poor.There is no difference outside the door.Then there are cost -effective.Of course, there are good aspects.You can stay."
0,"头两晚入住单间,窗式空调以及窗外传来的噪音让人无法入睡。查因房间唯一的窗户外是两栋大厦的夹缝,宽约两米,而两栋大厦的所有空调机都安装于此,可想而知同时启动的噪音有多么的轰动.但正值元旦假期,只能屈就.第三天转为双人间,犹如从地狱转往天堂,空调是分体的,远离夹缝,面积大两倍,还可远眺香港城貌,房价只交多100元.建议有意入住该酒店的朋友哪怕一个人也选择双人间,这里的地理位置实在棒极了.","In the first two nights, staying in a single room, window air conditioner and noise from outside the window make people unable to fall asleep.Check the only window of the two buildings in the room of the room, about two meters wide, and all air -conditioning machines in the two buildings are installed here. It can be imagined how sensational the noise started at the same time is. But the New Year's Day holiday, Can only be flexed. On the third day, turning into a double room, as if turning from hell to heaven, the air conditioner is split, away from the seams, double the area, and you can overlook the appearance of the city.Friends who intend to stay at the hotel even choose a double room even if a person is very good. The geographical location here is great."
0,走廊里的地毯很污浊，房间内的设施很一般，而且早晨七点钟以后才有热水。大床房应该包括两个人的早餐，可是服务员却告诉我们只能有一个人的，害得我早饭只吃了一半，还要和他们理论，虽然最后改成了两份早餐，但这样的遭遇真的让人很郁闷。象是政府的招待所。。。,"The carpet in the corridor is very dirty, the facilities in the room are very average, and there will be hot water after seven o'clock in the morning.The big bed room should include two people's breakfast, but the waiter told us that there was only one person, which made me only half of the breakfast and had to theory with them. Although it was finally changed to two breakfast, this encounter was really true.It is very depressed.It is a government's guest house.EssenceEssence"
1,晚上9点多到，结果前台说携程没有定，向我推荐了另一房间，由于外面下大雨，手机被雨水淋坏了，只好入住了。第二天携程电话确认，说确实给我定了，可能前台他们搞错了，或者是新来的。虽然有点不愉快，但是他们态度还是不错的。,"At 9 o'clock in the evening, the front desk said that Ctrip was not determined, and recommended another room to me. Due to the heavy rain outside, the mobile phone was damaged by the rain and had to stay in.The next day, Ctrip confirmed that it was indeed determined to me. Maybe they made mistakes at the front desk, or new.Although they are a bit unpleasant, they are still good."
1,我很晚才住进酒店，打车过去，从大门到我住的那栋，走了好久，本来已经疲惫不堪，还走了那么远一段路，而且晚上根本看不清哪栋是那栋，酒店应该二十四小时提供酒店内接送车和引导。,"I only lived in the hotel very late, took a taxi, from the door to the one I lived in. I walked for a long time. It was already exhausted. I still walked for such a long way.Twenty -four hours should be provided with the hotel pick -up vehicle and guidance."
0,去前作了功课，普遍说九江、庐山的酒店要比一般城市的低一个档次，所以也有了心理准备，所以5日晚入住时感觉还凑合，重要的是免费宽带上网给了小朋友一个惊喜，因此成了继续入住的最大理由（去酒店路上就觉得太偏准备第二天换地方的）。没有电梯，大堂楼梯第一级台阶口就是一个洗手间，门敞开着能见到里面的设施，略有点气味，奇怪的设置！上了三楼客房，更奇怪了：过道一边是客房，另一边是员工房，还有公用厕所，走廊较窄且由于公厕很小直接向过道开门，能直接感受员工厕所的味道。酒店位置相当偏僻，以为会很安静，谁知隔音太差，窗外大门口的声音听得很清楚可以听见几个员工在聊天，还有门口有条小溪谷的流水声音。房间较旧，特别是洗手间感觉有点脏（也许是从走廊飘过来的厕所味道？）浴缸墙上贴着“谷工里骨青垫子方骨垫”的字样，纳闷，后来琢磨出来了原来是这样的“浴缸里滑请垫好防滑垫”，哈哈...第二天一早厕所堵了打电话过了大半小时才来人!幸好我们是休闲游，没时间限制不着急。后来又发生了一件事才使我们对此酒店彻底失望：等了半天厕所通了，梳洗完毕，终于要出去逛了决定先上牯岭街走走在上一线的部分点看看，由于太偏没有车打电话给总台叫了一台车15元到街上，受了司机忽悠（怪自己立场不坚！）匆忙决定包车150元游一线，中间有些景点给漏掉了（因当天玩得过程中景点地图丢了，后来才发现的），最后说好在庐林湖大桥等我们，结果我们上了庐林大桥半个小时也没等到车，只好自己打车回了宾馆，后面的美庐、会址都没去。实际用车为三次：1.酒店-花径；2.仙人洞-街上（午餐）；3.街上-电站大坝。后来司机来宾馆大吵大闹也就罢了，毕竟我们之间有争议，可恶的是前台小姐和司机一个腔调，不知他们把顾客当成什么了！后来联系了庐山宾馆住，小标间的价格差不多，除了没有宽带上网，其他都比消夏好的多。庐宾的大标间有上网的但价格也贵一些。,"I did my homework before. It is generally said that the hotels in Jiujiang and Lushan are one level lower than the ordinary cities, so they are also mentally prepared.It became the biggest reason to continue to stay (I felt too partially prepared to change the place the next day on the way to the hotel).Without an elevator, the first step of the lobby staircase is a toilet. The door opens the facilities that can be seen. It is slightly scent and strange settings!On the third floor room, it is even more strange: the aisle is the guest room, the other side is the employee room, and the public toilet. The corridor is narrow and open the door directly to the aisle because the public toilet is small.The location of the hotel is quite remote. I thought it would be quiet. Who knew that the sound insulation was too bad. The sound at the gate outside the window could be heard very clearly. You can hear a few employees chatting, and there is a flowing sound of the small valley at the door.The room is older, especially the toilet feels a little dirty (maybe it tastes like the toilet floating from the corridor?) The bathtub wall is posted on the bathtub wall, ""The bone green cushion cushion in the valley worker"" was wondered.""Please slide in the bathtub, please put the anti -sliding pad"", haha ... The toilet was blocked for more than half an hour before the toilet was blocked the next morning! Fortunately, we were a leisure tour, and there was no time to limit it.Later, another thing happened to make us completely disappointed in this hotel: after waiting for a long time, the toilet was opened, and after the grooming, I finally went out to decide to go to Lingling Street to walk on the previous line.There was no car called the head office to call a car 15 yuan to the street, and the driver flickered (blame yourself without strong position!) Hurrying to decide to charter the car for 150 yuan to tour the front line.The map map was lost during the process, and later discovered). Finally, we said that we were waiting for us to wait for us. As a result, we got on the Lulin Bridge for half an hour and did not wait for the car.The site did not go.The actual car is three times: 1. Hotel-flower path; 2. Fairy Cave-Street (lunch); 3. Street-power station dam.Later, the driver came to the hotel and made a lot of noise. After all, there was controversy between us. The abominable thing was that the front desk lady and the driver had a tone. I wonder what they regarded customers!Later, I contacted the Lushan Hotel. The price of the small bids was similar. Except for no broadband access, everything else was much better than the Xia Xia.There is a lot of access to the Internet, but the price is also more expensive."
0,只能说是我住过的很差的酒店，房间隔音很差，隔壁的客人电视开的声音很大，感觉就和我在一个房间一样，很吵，另外酒店的服务更差，上一次入住的时候，是一个朋友给预定的，并且先交了房费就出差了，可是前台找不到前一班工作人员证明已经付了款的留言条，确说我们没有付款，最可气的是我刚经历了隔壁的噪音刚刚睡着，在将近１２点的时候，前台打电话让我续房费，说没有人给我们交房费，他们没有看到任何显示我们的房费已经结过，害的我还象朋友抱怨了一番，结果下去续了房费后，在快睡着的时候恼人的电话再次响起，说找到留言条了，说我们的房费已经结过了，天啊，快一点了，还是个大堂经理，就这种素质，我真不敢想象，为了能在携成点评，再次来到银川的时候，我又来到了这里．就是想告诉大家这家店到底有多烂！！！,"It can only be said that I have lived a very poor hotel. The room sound insulation is very poor. The guests of the guests next door are loud. It feels like I am in a room. It is very noisy.When it was a friend, a friend was booked, and the house fee was on a business trip first, but the front desk could not find the previous group of the staff proved to the message that had been paid. It was said that we did not pay.I just experienced the noise next door just asleep. At nearly 12 o'clock, the front desk called me to renew the housing fee, saying that no one paid us a house fee.I also complained like a friend. As a result, after I continued the house fee, the annoying phone call rang again when I was asleep.At one point, it is still a lobby manager. In this quality, I really dare not imagine. In order to be able to bring a review, when I came to Yinchuan again, I came here again.I just want to tell everyone how bad this shop is!IntersectionIntersection"
0,房间一般，洗手间浴缸里的水有些下不去，标房是对着大堂餐厅开窗户的，晚上12点好象还有人用餐，放音乐，挺吵的．,The room is average. The water in the bathtub in the bathroom cannot go down. The benchmarking room is opened to the lobby restaurant. It seems that there are still people dining at 12 pm.
1,服务和房间算四星级吧。可能由于是携程的房间，贵宾楼标间，没什么景观，推窗看到10米外的另一家酒店。交通不是很好，去西街和刘三姐得走10分钟。不过条件应该比西街得酒店好多了。补充点评2007年10月15日：想评三分的，选错选项了。想评三分的，选错选项了。想评三分的，选错选项了。,"Service and rooms are four -star.Maybe because it is Ctrip's room, the VIP building standard room, there is no landscape, pushing the window to see another hotel at 10 meters away.The transportation is not very good. Go to West Street and Sister Liu for 10 minutes.But the conditions should be much better than the West Street.Supplementary comment on October 15, 2007: If you want to evaluate three points, choose the wrong option.If you want to review three points, choose the wrong option.If you want to review three points, choose the wrong option."
1,坦白说，酒店比我想象中的好。在三星酒店中属于较好的一类。员工的服务意识很强，不象是内地城市。但是，携程的价钱不够有竞争力，在火车站遇到的拉客的导游，可以提供更好的价格（路遇的旅伴尝试了）。,"Frankly speaking, the hotel is better than I think.It is a better category in Samsung Hotel.The employee's awareness of service is very strong, not like a mainland city.However, Ctrip's price is not enough to be competitive. The tour guides who encountered at the railway station can provide better prices (the travelers of Lu Yu have tried)."
1,去开展会，住住还行。距离会展中心不是很远，交通也比较方便,"Go to the meeting and live.It is not far from the convention and exhibition center, and the transportation is more convenient"
0,遇停水一次，说是突发事件。态度相当恶劣。第二天送上两只香蕉，两只苹果的“果篮”作为道歉。建议不要选择电梯附近的房间，门口有服务电话，房间隔音很差，很吵。早餐的两个地方只能打60分。出租车是现叫。14楼走廊里的服务电话机很脏。,"When it comes to stopping the water, it is said to be an emergency.The attitude is quite bad.Give two bananas the next day, and the ""fruit basket"" of the two apples as an apology.It is recommended not to choose the room near the elevator.

0,房间是新的，不过根本不值这个价，太贵了，而且连早餐都没有，全是起了让你吃面条的这种，，，再也不会去住这个酒店了。,"The room is new, but it is not worth the price at all, it is too expensive, and there is no breakfast. It is all about making you eat noodles."
1,住了几次了，价格倒还可以接受，不过在这里觉得再低些可能会更有竞争力。不过，令人惊奇的是：3天内在房间里打死了2只蟑螂！,"I have lived several times, and the price is acceptable, but here I feel that it may be more competitive.However, it is surprising that 2 cockroaches were killed in the room within 3 days!"
1,高级标件里面的电脑是坏的，结果么后果很严重。,"The computers in the advanced marked parts are bad, and the results are very serious."

1,是一间很有特色的酒店，我住了三个晚上。古色古香的老房和地理位置是最大亮点。我住的三人房还配备了可上网的电脑，乐坏了我女儿。稍为不足之处：一是可能时值盛夏，蚊子太多，酒店的杀蚊驱蚊措施还嫌不足；二是卫生间的卫生还可以更好一些，浴帘看上去太不干净；三是虽然有一台洗衣机，但是滚筒式，不好操作，服务员还一问三不知，极为不方便，原来还说要收钱；四是服务员素质实在不怎么样，对绍兴的食住行好象全然不懂，这比起锦江之星实在差得太远了。,"It is a very distinctive hotel, I stayed for three nights.The old house and geographical location of antique are the biggest highlights.The three -person room I lived in the Internet was also equipped with a computer that available on the Internet, and my daughter broke my daughter.It is a little shorter: First, it may be in the summer, there are too many mosquitoes, and the hotel's mosquito repellent measures are not enough; the second is that the sanitation in the bathroom can be better, and the shower curtain looks too clean;The washing machine, but the drum type, it was not easy to operate, the waiter also asked three unknown, it was extremely inconvenient.

1,入住的是高级湖景房，房间确实够大，景观也很好，大堂的工作人员也非常热情周到。但房间内的装修真的有些旧了，特别是电视该换大一些的。,"The high -end lake scenery is in the room.

0,相对于长春的物价，这个价格有点贵。条件一般，硬件设施比较普通，没有北京如家的温馨。房子也比较小，希望价格上有些优惠，如果没有优惠，希望携程能联系到长春其他连锁的经济型酒店，有很多条件不错的。,"Compared to Changchun's prices, this price is a bit expensive.The conditions are average, and the hardware facilities are relatively ordinary, without the warmth of Beijing Rujia.The house is also relatively small. I hope there are some discounts in the price. If there are no discounts, I hope that Ctrip can contact other chain hotels in Changchun. There are many good conditions."
1,388元的B标准间房间很好的！设备不错！但是淋浴房缺少一个放东西的支架，不是很方便。服务很好的！出门也方便，停车安全。液晶电视！装修比较新！但是房间比较小！据说开业时间早，无法改变。面临很大的黄山湖公园，环境保护的很好的！,"The room B of 388 yuan is good!Good equipment!But the shower room lacks a bracket to put things, which is not very convenient.The service is very good!It is also convenient to go out and stop parking.LCD TV!The decoration is relatively new!But the room is relatively small!It is said that the opening time is early and cannot be changed.Facing the large Huangshan Lake Park, environmental protection is very good!"
1,去苏州之前，听朋友介绍了这家酒店，于是通过携程定了房间。当出租车司机将车子开进酒店时，顿时眼前豁然开朗，没有想到在市区还会有这样一家闹中取静的园林式酒店。走进大堂，行李员很热情的打招呼。来到前台，很快办理了入住手续，服务人员的办事效率较高。一路走上房间，假山、廊亭、瀑布尽收眼底，房间布置很别致，床头有一首唐诗，很有意境，就是房间面积有点小，但窗外景色不错。这次入住给我和朋友都留下了很深的印象，下次去苏州还想住那！,"Before going to Suzhou, I heard a friend introduced this hotel, so I settled the room through Ctrip.When the taxi driver drove the car into the hotel, it was suddenly cheerful. I did not expect that there would be such a quiet garden -style hotel in the urban area.Entering the lobby, the luggage officer greeted him enthusiastically.When I came to the front desk, I quickly went through the procedures for check -in, and the service staff had a higher efficiency.All the way to the room, the rockery, gallery pavilion, and waterfalls are full of views. The room layout is very unique. There is a Tang poem on the bedside. It is very artistic.This time I was impressed with my friends and my friends. I still want to live in Suzhou next time!"
1,房间的布置还有酒店的环境确实让人感觉物超所值！但是酒店的服务就感觉太没有星级的标准的！感觉什么都是冷冷的！早餐还不错！但是中餐就不怎么样了！不过分量还是可以的！,The layout of the room is that the environment of the hotel really feels good value for people!But the hotel's service feels too star -level standards!It feels cold!Breakfast is not bad!But Chinese food is not very good!But the weight is still possible!
1,"我订的是标C，相对于140元的价钱，不能要求太多了。设施陈旧，走廊复杂，应多开几个出口。但还算干净，不讲究的话也能泡澡。屯溪老街感觉还行，有一家深处的百年徽菜老店强烈推荐！真便宜，关键是菜的口味一尝就知是大师风范。茶叶是千万不能买，太不值。卖价4,5百的黄山毛峰没有一大把泡不出味，真正的好茶不是这样的。宣笔价廉物美，花20,30元不妨附庸风雅。胡开文的墨卖的较贵，但可接受。要是烦了游人如织，可到齐云山躲半天（缺点是门票75较贵，如果40就比较合适，另缆车往返40）.。还有西递晚8点后不用买票，我没去宏村，不知是否一样。","I booked a standard C.

1,已经评价过一次这个饭店了，每次到开平都是住在这里。这次去，好像服务员换了，原来熟悉的面孔少见了。房间里面的电话不好使，发现后马上更换了。希望提醒一下注意服务质量，因为对这家饭店原来一直十分满意的。,"This restaurant has been evaluated once, and every time I arrive in Kaiping, I live here.This time, it seems that the waiter has changed, and the familiar face is rare.The phone in the room was not good, and it was replaced immediately after discovering.I hope to remind you to pay attention to the quality of service, because it is always very satisfied with this hotel."

1,鹭江宾馆的位置非常好，交通轮渡可谓四通八达。宾馆旁边是步行街，对面是鼓浪屿，如果住海景房的话，鼓浪屿全景尽收眼底。宾馆入住和退房都比较快的，房间不错，早餐也可以的。下次去厦门还会住的。,"The location of the Lujiang Hotel is very good, and the transportation of traffic can be described as in all directions.Next to the hotel is the pedestrian street, and the opposite side is Gulangyu.

1,入住前看了之前各位网友的点评，心里预期不是很高，而且自己准备了拖鞋和饮用水，在入住的时候特意要了无烟房。入住之后，发现房间的面积挺大，基本设施虽然不新但是功能都完好，房间（我住在3层）的隔音也不错。总体感觉还可以了。,"I watched the comments from all netizens before check -in. I was not expected to be very high, and I prepared slippers and drinking water. When I stayed, I asked the smokeless room.After checking in, I found that the area of the room was quite large.

1,入住这家酒店是在很急迫的情况下，因为原先定的松赞林寺到了之后落荒而逃(庙宇路段整个在修建，而且位置很偏）我们一边在路上电话联系携程，在10分钟后到达酒店并且搞定入住，在这点上真的让我很喜欢ctrip.这家酒店的大堂并不算出彩，不过进入房间后，发现还是很令我们惊喜的。房间和卫生间都不算大，不过，因为新装修过的关系，用了很多原木做装饰，室内的灯也很有中国的特色，是很自然的那种。在卫生间里还有个温馨的提示：由于此处海拔3500米，洗澡时间不要超过20分钟。不过，后来据当地司机说，香格里拉的酒店价格是可以谈的，散客最低可以拿到280/晚。不过，总体说这里住的还是不错的，如果价格象280就真的是性价比比较高了。,"Staying in this hotel is in a very urgent situation, because the original Songzanlin Temple fled after the arrival (the temple road section was built, and the position was very wrong), we contacted Ctrip on the road and arrived at the hotel 10 minutes later.And getting in, I really like ctrip in this point. The lobby of this hotel is not outstanding, but after entering the room, I found that it was very surprising to us.The rooms and bathrooms are not large, but because of the newly decorated relationship, a lot of logs are used for decoration, and the indoor lights are also very Chinese characteristic, which is very natural.There is also a warm reminder in the bathroom: because the altitude is 3500 meters, the bathing time should not exceed 20 minutes.However, according to the local driver, the price of Shangri -La's hotel can be discussed, and the minimum can get 280/night.However, in general, it is still good to live here. If the price is like 280, it is really cost -effective."
1,总体来说算满意，房间比较大，床还算干净，床头装饰比较漂亮，卫生间尚可。提供接机服务，虽然车比较陈旧，但毕竟是免费的。地理位置很好，在束河古镇内，强烈推荐住那里，觉得比大研古城好，安静一点，而且人很热情，不像古城内，商业气息太浓，人也没古镇友好。服务比较好，有问必答。缺点：淋浴水温根本无法调到舒适的温度，不是太冷就是太热。地毯比较脏，建议要经常吸尘，不然干脆换木质地板。性价比有待提高。,"Generally speaking, the room is relatively large, the bed is clean, the bedside decoration is more beautiful, and the bathroom is acceptable.Provide pick -up services. Although the car is relatively old, it is free after all.The geographical location is very good. In the ancient town of Shuhe, it is highly recommended to live there. I feel that it is better than the ancient city of Dasan, and it is quiet. It is very enthusiastic. Unlike the ancient city, the business atmosphere is too strong, and people are not friendly.The service is better, there is a question of answering questions.Disadvantages: The temperature of the shower water cannot be adjusted to a comfortable temperature at all, either too cold or too hot.The carpet is relatively dirty. It is recommended to get vacuuming frequently, otherwise you can just change the wooden floor.The cost performance needs to be increased."
1,"这是一家性价比很好的饭店,是苏州闹中取静的一处福地.酒店有宽敞的停车场,绿地面积大,古木参天,绿草如茵.登上小山,还有可供游人休息的凉厅,山脚下流水淙淙.房间里布置典雅华丽,中式的且床头有古诗相伴而眠.","This is a very good cost -effective restaurant. It is a blessing place in Suzhou. The hotel has a spacious parking lot, the green space is large, the ancient wood is towering, and the green grass is like the mountain.The Liang Hall, flowing at the foot of the mountain.

1,总体来说还可以！就是房间稍微小一点，床也不太大，家具有点旧了，但是比较干净。服务还可以，饭菜的口味也不错。比较经济实惠！,"Generally acceptable!That is, the room is slightly smaller, the bed is not too big, the furniture is a bit old, but it is relatively clean.The service is okay, and the taste of the meals is also good.More economical!"
1,第二次帮别人预定这个酒店了，第一的时候反映相当好，所以这次有订了据说不错！下次自己去住住试试。,"The second time I helped others book this hotel. The first time was pretty good, so this time it is said to be good!Try it yourself next time."

1,总体来说不错。设施比较新，房间也不错。下楼30米就是星巴克。缺点：1，楼下就在修地铁；2，早晨我是被隔壁的XX声叫醒的，而且很清楚！3，上网系统简直会让人想顺着网线把服务器扯过来砸了......4，洗发液都是含护发成分的，短发男性会比较痛苦。补充点评2008年7月25日：忘了说了，我是大概2周前入住的。另外我也没吃那里的早餐，没法点评=。=,"Overall is good.The facilities are relatively new and the room is good.30 meters downstairs is Starbucks.Disadvantages: 1. The subway is repaired downstairs; 2. In the morning, I was awakened by the XX sound of the next door, and it was very clear!3.

1,条件不错，就是隔音效果不好，晚上有点吵，其他都挺好的,"The conditions are good, but the sound insulation is not good, it is a bit noisy at night, everything else is good"
1,在携程我订的是标准房，房间比较小，经行李员的提醒马上就加价换成了豪华房。豪华房的房间就比较大，卫生间也很大。早餐不是很丰富，地点比较好，离葡金和永利都很近，酒店3楼也是赌场，娱乐一下也很方便。,"I booked a standard room in Ctrip, and the room was relatively small. The reminder from the luggage immediately changed the price to a luxury room.The room of luxury rooms is relatively large and the bathroom is very large.Breakfast is not very rich, the location is better, it is very close to Portuguese gold and Wynn. The 3rd floor of the hotel is also a casino. It is also convenient to entertain."
1,朋友介绍的，我也请客户住在那里。感觉是我看到过最注重细节管理的酒店，很多设置都很舒心和用心，比如代客泊车、房间的摆设、门口和电梯口美女应门。房间点餐应该是二楼的驹鲍的菜，味道很不错，而且24小时都可以点，菜品也非常丰富。除了市口偏一点，其他都不错。我朋友入住期间生日，还送了一个不错的蛋糕，可见用心。,"According to friends, I also invite customers to live there.It feels like I have seen hotels that pay attention to details. Many settings are very comfortable and attentive, such as passenger parking, room furnishings, door and elevator beauty.The room ordering should be the dish of the second floor. It tastes very good, and it can be ordered for 24 hours. The dishes are very rich.Except for the market, everything is good.During my birthday, my friend also gave a good cake, which showed intentions."
1,大概初六、初七的时候入住，酒店大堂很漂亮，预定的高级间，中午到酒店直接入住，房间干净整洁，床很小一大一小睡一张很不舒服，但入住第二天有水果赠送,"I stayed in about the sixth and seventh day of the first day. The hotel lobby was very beautiful. The predetermined high -level room, I went to the hotel directly at noon, the room was clean and tidy, and the bed was small and one sleeping.Give away"
1,呵呵，又住了回豪华双床房，感觉房间比标间大了，没那么压抑，床也大了，比较舒服。就是电视太小了，农村的朋友家估计都没有这么小的电视了吧。卫生间还是太简陋了，和酒店的整体定位不匹配。衣柜里缺少浴袍，总可以提供两套吧，我住过的更便宜的酒店都有提供。,"Hehe, I lived back to the luxurious double bed again. I feel that the room is larger than the standard room, not so depressed, the bed is bigger, and it is more comfortable.It ’s too small TV, and my friends in rural areas are probably not so small.The bathroom is still too simple, and does not match the overall positioning of the hotel.There is a lack of bathrobes in the wardrobe. You can always provide two sets. The cheaper hotels I have provided."
0,"来往虹桥机场,绝对方便,938公共汽车直接门对门,上车睡觉就可以了(一个半小时)宾馆服务不专业(餐厅).基本上还可以,谈不上星级.房价和硬件不能划等号","It is absolutely convenient to travel to and from Hongqiao Airport. The 938 bus is directly at the door, and you can go to sleep (one and a half hours).Number"
0,预订的是钱塘江景标房，一进门就闻到了浓烈的烟味，所谓的江景举目望去基本上只有2层高的野草；最不能忍受的是房间里有跳蚤，以致于我们一个晚上只能穿长衣长裤带好帽子睡觉，但是身上还是时不时的红肿瘙痒。软件服务不错。我想我不会再选择开元之江了，出门在外卫生安全问题是很重要的。,"The booking of the Qiantang River viewing room was booked. As soon as I entered the door, I smelled a strong smell of smoke. The so -called Jiangjing Law seemed to have only 2 floors of weight. The most unbearable was that there were fleas in the room.Wearing long clothes and trousers to sleep with a hat, but it is still red, swollen and itching from time to time.Software services are good.I don't think I will choose the Kaiyuan River anymore. It is important to go out to sanitary safety."
0,大家千万不要去住这间酒店;那里的服务员好像你欠了钱一样;特别是前台;好像你杀了他们全家一样;但是收费确是4星的收费喔;房间的空调就像拖拉机;我真不知携程现在越来越差了'我现在只能每去一个地方跟人酒店去了协议了!,Don't stay in this hotel; the waiters there are like you owe money; especially at the front desk; as if you have killed their whole family;I do n’t know if Ctrip is getting worse and worse now. ’I can only go to a hotel everywhere to go to a hotel everywhere!
1,酒店位于深圳,The hotel is located in Shenzhen
1,"酒店非常好,房间大,环境好.再去沈阳还住凯宾斯基.","The hotel is very good, the room is large, and the environment is good. Then go to Shenyang to live in Kimbinski."
0,"千万不要去.重庆的朋友说是渡假型4星我就帮领导订了.现在肠子都悔青了.1.楼道非常窄,房间并无特色还是近5星的价格2.东楼居然是后面一个普通的楼改的,我去看了立马退了那个东楼的房3.服务还是比较满意,酒店硬件配套就差了.","Don't go. Friends in Chongqing said that it was a holiday type 4 star. I helped the leader to order. Now the intestines are regretful. 1. The corridor is very narrow, and the room is not unique.It was a normal building in the back. I went to see the house in the east building. 3. The service is still satisfied. The hotel's hardware supporting facilities are worse."
0,可以这样评价是我们住过的最差的酒店，简陋的大堂，肮脏的房间，可怕的卫生间，绝对是一场恶梦！！,"It can be evaluated in this way, the worst hotel we have lived, the humble lobby, the dirty room, and the terrible bathroom, it is definitely a nightmare!Intersection"
0,位置在4叉路口，有高架桥（高架桥上车少竟然有摩托车！）安吉有许多改装过的三轮“汽车”，发出拖拉机的声音，当然不选靠马路的房间。室内装修在安吉可以算第一，但强烈鄙视卫生间的感应通风机，每次进去发出农村排风机的声音，第二次感应到人存在，马上加大马力的工作。有时会自动排风，估计用的感应器质量问题。我住的是靠内的3楼房间，下面2楼是连着厨房的，6个排风扇让我叹为观止！！幸好酒店的饭店是8；30pm就关门。但是白天实在吵人，只能开电视抵御。结论此酒店的装修布局存在很大问题，酒店人员应该看看别人的酒店是怎样维护客人的安静权力。另外有骚扰电话，估计每位客人都能接到2，3个。吃饭：菜价格便宜，买一送一，量足。但是味精方太多，各位讲究的大大，一定要提前说明。,"The location is at the 4 fork intersection, and there are viaducts (there are few motorcycles on the viaduct!) Anji has many modified three -wheeled ""cars"", making the sound of tractor, of course, not choosing a room for the road.The interior decoration can be counted as the first in Anji, but strongly despise the inductive ventilation in the bathroom. Each time you go in and send out the sound of rural exhaust denses, the second sense of induction makes people exist and immediately increase horsepower work.Sometimes it will automatically discharge, and the quality of the sensor is estimated.I live in the room on the 3rd floor. The second floor below is connected to the kitchen. The six row fans are amazing!IntersectionFortunately, the hotel's hotel is 8; 30pm is closed.But it is really noisy during the day and can only start TV to resist.Conclusion The decoration layout of this hotel has a big problem. Hotel staff should see how other people's hotels maintain the quiet power of guests.There are also harassing calls, and each guest is estimated to receive 2,3.Eat: The price of dishes is cheap, buy one get one free, enough.But there are too many MSG, and everyone must explain it in advance."
1,一半的时间在酒店度过的工作性质，比较挑剔的性格：服务好！,"Half of the working nature of the work in the hotel, more discerning character: good service!"
1,几个月之后再次入住，一进门大厅里一位女工作人员就叫得出我的名字，很不一般。服务没得说，酒店位置也很好，位于威海市中心。,"After a few months, I stayed again. As soon as a female staff member entered the hall, a female staff member called my name, which was very unusual.The service is not to say that the hotel location is also very good, located in the center of Weihai."
1,交通方便服务周到，很不错的酒店。唯一不满意的是价格没有竞争力，比汉庭的普通会员还贵。而且没有早餐送，比较遗憾。,"The transportation is convenient and good -looking, very good hotel.The only dissatisfaction is that the price is not competitive, and it is more expensive than the ordinary members of the Hanting.And there is no breakfast, it is regrettable."
1,酒店设施较一般，但被单毛巾洁白干净，服务热情。可能酒店系早年建设，地下车库没有直达大堂通道，不甚方便。饭菜很对嗜辣者，如能兼顾南来北往客，增加一些非辣的菜肴更好。另希望通过服务技能。,"The hotel facilities are relatively average, but they are white and clean by single towels, and their service enthusiasm.Maybe the hotel was built in the early years, and the underground garage did not reach the lobby channel, which was not convenient.The food is very spicy. If you can take into account the north and north, it is better to add some non -spicy dishes.I also hope that through service skills."
1,"不的商酒店,地及交通都挺合短期出差的房也敞,值得推","No commercial hotels, the houses and transportation are also very open for short -term business, which is worth pushing"
0,感觉一般，就是各方面都一般，在三门峡这种地方住住还是可以的,"It feels average, that is, in all aspects, it is still possible to live in a place like Sanmenxia"
1,"本人25号入住该酒店,27号离开,给我的感觉是酒店卫生不错,房间也很安静,交通比较方便,楼下就是市民广场,有吃有喝有玩,让我不太满意的有两点;一,房间灯光太暗,本人喜欢明亮;二:卫生间的淋喷头位于头顶上方,对不想洗头的客人有点麻烦.总的来说还可以,下次考虑再住该酒店.","I stayed at the hotel on the 25th and left on the 27th. The feeling of giving me is that the hotel is hygienic, the room is very quiet, and the transportation is more convenient. There is a citizen's square downstairs.Click; first, the room lights are too dark, I like bright; 2: The spray head of the bathroom is located above the head, which is a bit troublesome for customers who do not want to wash their hair. In general, it is OK. Next time, consider staying at the hotel."
1,四星级酒店，房间(高级客房)很不错，窗户双层玻璃封闭，无法开启，隔音效果好；客房设施配套完善，三部电话(书桌、床头、洗手间)，小冰箱，小保险柜，热水壶，收费饮料品种选择较多；淋浴水量充足。缺点是：1、酒店入住、退房登记时都遭遇了排队等候2、酒店所处位置打车不便,"Four -star hotels, rooms (high -end rooms) are very good. Double -layer glass of windows is closed and cannot be opened. The sound insulation effect is good; the room facilities are complete, three telephones (desks, bedside, toilet), small refrigerators, small safe, small safe, small safe, small safe, small safe, small safe, small safe, small safe, small safe, small safe, small safe, small safe,Hot kettle, there are more choices for toll beverage; the amount of shower water is sufficient.The disadvantage is: 1. In the hotel, the hotel was in and out of the check -up."
0,刚刚入住是发现房间的地毯和椅子都是湿的，打电话询问时前台只是说明了为什么椅子和地毯会是湿的、一点歉意都没感觉到。结果只给换了两把椅子，实在有些让人不爽。离五星级服务还有距离。,"I just stayed in the room that the carpets and chairs of the room were wet. When the call was called, the front desk just showed why the chairs and carpets were wet, and they didn't feel a little apologize.As a result, I only changed two chairs, which was a bit uncomfortable.There is still a distance from five -star service."
1,很一般，也就是3-4星级水平。房间里有崭新的电脑，早餐尚可，房价不贵，实际上在保税区也没什么更好的选择了。,"Very average, that is, the level of 3-4 stars.There are brand -new computers in the room. Breakfast is acceptable. House prices are not expensive. In fact, there is no better choice in the bonded area."
1,特别感谢工号0649的崔小姐（手机号136134462**），下次到太原出差一定要当面感谢她的。我是4月10号入住的，11号一早赶班机，把一条项链丢在了客房，直到回家都没有发现，还是崔小姐主动打电话和我核实，而且自己掏钱帮我寄了回来，并且多次去邮局帮我查询，这种精神太难得了。非常感谢！酒店门前确实有黑车，本来对酒店印象很一般的，但有这样的员工很让人感动。下次去太原一定还会入住的！,"Special thanks to Miss Cui (mobile phone number 136134462 **), who is especially thanks to the work number 0649. Next time I arrived in Taiyuan for business, she must thank her in person in person.I stayed on April 10th. On the 11th morning, I rushed the plane and threw a necklace in the room. I didn't find it when I went home.And I went to the post office many times to help me inquire. This spirit is too rare.Thank you so much!There is indeed a black car in front of the hotel, which was very impressed with the hotel, but there were such employees very moving.Next time I go to Taiyuan, I will stay in!"
0,"一个词----""大失所望""!!!去广州之前,在携程上研究了半天,后来应老公的要求选择了Elan,因为他从欧洲带过来的那本""CHINA----lonelyplanet""上极尽完美之辞的推荐了该酒店.网上看图片和介绍,觉得应该也不错(没有查点评),我当时认为应该和""有一家""的水平差不多.可是一进房间,发现和图片实在相差太远.房间小得可怜,没有地方放行李,甚至连坐的地方都没有.一张小得可怜的写字台上有一台小得可怜的""液晶电视"".如果你想躺在床上看电视,恐怕需要一双""千里眼"";如果你想使用那张写字台,那你一定需要很苗条,才能坐在那个位置,并且需要带一台小于12寸的笔记本，否则是放不下的.房间也不干净,首先进去的那间330元的大床房,马桶里居然还漂着头发.后来立马换了间560元的套房,其实也就稍微大一点点,多了个坐的地方,有沙发和桌子及大一点的普通电视.房间设施很陈旧,地板有些地方已经翘起来了,隔音不好,热水水压也不够.....前台服务还不错,服务员能说英语;但是压根没见到行李生.个人感觉,不值那个价钱;个人意见,不推荐入住!","A word ---- ""Hope disappointed"" !!! Before going to Guangzhou, he studied on Ctrip for a long time. Later, he chose ELAN at the request of her husband because he brought from Europe.I recommend the hotel very perfectly. Look at the pictures and introductions on the Internet. I think it should be good (no review). At that time, I thought it should be similar to the level of ""one family"".Too far. The room is so small that there is no place to put luggage, and there is no place to sit. There is a small ""LCD TV"" on a poor writing desk. If you want to lie on the bed to watch TV, I am afraid that you need it.A pair of ""thousands of miles""; if you want to use that writing table, then you must need to be slim before you can sit in that position, and you need to bring a notebook less than 12 inches, otherwise you can’t put it.In the 330 yuan large bed room, the toilet actually drifted her hair. Later, I immediately changed the 560 yuan suite. In fact, it was a little bigger.Ordinary TV. The room facilities are very old, and some places have been tilted in some places. The sound insulation is not good, and the hot water pressure is not enough ..... The front desk service is good, the waiter can speak English;Feeling, it is not worth that price; personal opinion, not recommended to check in!"
1,酒店真的不错，就是早餐都是韩式的有点怪。,"The hotel is really good, that is, breakfast is a bit of Korean."
0,"房间设备陈旧而且不齐全,一点也不象四星的酒店.所以房价显高.我就不明白河南的所谓四星级酒店凭什么比成都、南宁等省会城市的四星房价还高。","The room equipment is old and incomplete, and it is not like a four -star hotel. So house prices are high. I don't understand why the so -called four -star hotels in Henan are higher than the four -star house prices in the four -star cities such as Chengdu and Nanning."
0,房间为商务人士装修，没有挂衣服的衣橱和放东西的柜子，而是一些生出来的钩子。3月25日一开始入住时发现热水水温很低，不足以洗头洗澡，后来前台派了师傅来查发现时锅炉房水温设置过低，调整后好了，整个过程服务人员态度尚可。但是夜间来临时发现该酒店的地下室是西宁市最大的迪厅，沉重的重音效果越过遥遥4-5层楼板和我的耳塞依然无法平息。据前台的人说要迪厅营业她们也没有办法，音响临晨2点才会歇。附近还有好乐迪KTV什么的。这样的旅馆就算一夜80元（订价163）我也不会住的。后来将就了一夜（难怪叫一天快捷），第二天晚移至康乐的“永昌大厦”（八一中路78号），80元的标间，有热水洗澡，夜里睡得很好。,"The room is decorated for business people, without the wardrobe of clothes and the cabinets, but some hooks.At the beginning of March 25, the hot water temperature was found to be very low, which was not enough to wash their hair and take a bath. Later, when the master was sent to the front desk, the boiler water temperature was set too low. After the adjustment was adjusted, the service staff attitude was acceptable.However, at night, I found that the basement of the hotel was the largest Defilled Hall in Xining. The heavy stress effect was still unable to calm down the 4-5 floors and my earplugs.According to the people at the front desk, they have no way to do it, and the audio will not rest at 2 o'clock in the morning.There is also a good Leyi KTV nearby.I will not live even if such a hotel is 80 yuan per night (price 163).Later, it will be one night (no wonder it is fast one day), and the next day it will move to Kangle's ""Yongchang Building"" (No. 78 in Bayi Middle Road). At the standard room of 80 yuan, there is a hot water bath and sleep well at night."
1,"这里交通和饮食便利,服务态度好,性价比不错,就是热水不太热,值得推荐.","There are convenient transportation and diet, good service attitude, and good cost performance, that is, hot water is not hot, it is worth recommending."
1,"房间空间还好满宽敞的,但是朝南面挨着马路比较吵,房间的隔音效果只能说一般.硬件设施上特别是卫生间感觉欠档次地上有从淋浴房渗露出水来,毛巾\浴斤之类明显是比较旧了,建议更换.大厅、餐厅服务员的态度比较好，给我印象很深刻的是刚入住的时候电视机不会搞随便走廊上叫了个服务员帮我弄，服务员很热情帮我调好频道，服务员始终脸上挂满笑容让我很满意！退房的时候大厅前台居然要多收我钱，我坚持按网上预定价格付，最后还是按网上价格付，我不知道她是怎么算的，本想投诉的，但她后来也没多收我钱也就算了。结论：这个价格能够得到这种服务，基本上也知足了，还不错，下次在住！","The room space is still full of spacious, but it is noisy to the road south next to the road. The sound insulation effect of the room can only be said to be general. Hardware facilities, especially in the bathroom, feel that there is water from the shower room.The class is obviously older. It is recommended to replace it. The attitude of the waiter in the hall and restaurant is better. What impressed me was that the TV would not call a waiter to help me get it in the corridor when just staying.I adjusted the channel, and the waiter was always full of smiles on my face!When you check out, you need to collect more money at the front desk of the lobby. I insist on paying the price online, and finally pay at the online price. I don’t know how she calculates it. I wanted to complain, but she did not accept me much later.Even if money is okay.Conclusion: This price can get this kind of service, which is basically content, not bad, live next time!"
1,酒店设计有特色，房间很舒服亦很美，位置于南门很方便出入，而且又有得免费上网。前台服务员不错，唯退房时出了点问题，令大打折扣。事缘我们有饮用酒店雪柜内的汽水，但临退房前已经买回一样的饮品放进去，但酒店说汽水的包装不一样，所以必须收我们钱，最终由查房、收钱、拿回我们的汽水花了我二十分钟，刚刚我又要赶车，很气愤！我们一共住了三天，花了千多元，那几元都要和我们收足，很讨厌！,"The hotel design is distinctive, the room is very comfortable and beautiful, it is convenient to enter and exit at the south gate, and it has to go online for free.The waiter at the front desk is good, but there is something wrong when he retreats, which makes great discounts.We have a drinking soda in the hotel's refrigerator, but I bought the same drinks in the house before retreating, but the hotel said that the packaging of soda is different, so we must collect our money. In the end, it must be charged.Back to our soda for 20 minutes, I was going to catch the car just now, very angry!We lived in total for three days and spent more than a thousand yuan. We have to get enough money with us. I hate it!"
0,如果要求较高，就不要住这里。--经济房很小，床较硬，夜晚有锅炉声音的干扰。标准间较大，但墙面陈旧，地毯斑驳，卫生间简陋，洗完淋浴后水流四处，下一个人可以直接洗盆池了。前台不负责任，没有保留预订的房间，携程与之交涉后，才勉强换房。总体态度冷淡。房间外部环境不错，但问题是，若是来旅游，你有多少时间来享受它的乌语花香呢？补充点评2008年8月1日：从酒店出去打车有好一段路要走，交通不算太方便。,"If the requirements are high, don't live here.-It the economic house is small, the bed is harder, and there is a boiler sound interference at night.The standard room is large, but the walls are old, the carpets are mottled, and the bathroom is rude. After the shower is washed, the water flows around, and the next person can directly wash the pot pond.The front desk was irresponsible and there was no reservation room. After Ctrip negotiated with it, he barely changed the house.The overall attitude is cold.The outside environment of the room is good, but the problem is, how much time do you have time to enjoy its black flower fragrance?Supplementary comment on August 1, 2008: There is a good way to take a taxi from the hotel, and the transportation is not too convenient."
1,酒店服务员服务态度很好，酒店硬件条件很差，要么是个老酒店要么就是因为维护问题，房顶几乎全部都有起皮现象，玻璃外部奇脏。早餐品种还说的过去，但量少，希望有所改进。但在盘锦这地方，我想这酒店也应该算是不错的了，我感觉酒店设施的陈旧应该和入住人员的素质有关，客人不爱惜酒店设施，但依然希望酒店应该尽快更新破损的部分。,"The hotel waiter's service attitude is very good. The hotel's hardware conditions are poor. Either an old hotel or because of maintenance problems. Almost all of the roofs have peeling phenomena, and the glass is strange.Breakfast varieties are also mentioned, but the amount is small, and I hope to improve.But in Panjin, I think this hotel should be considered good. I feel that the old of the hotel facilities should be related to the quality of the occupants. Guests do not like the hotel facilities, but still hope that the hotel should update the damaged part as soon as possible."
0,一到晚上生意就非常的好，这么破的酒店还能吸引人的原因是因为价格还算便宜。,The business is very good at night. The reason why such a broken hotel can attract is because the price is cheap.
0,酒店比较旧，靠近机场，能听到很大的噪音。空调也不开，关上窗屋内的气味让人头晕，开窗基本被吵的睡不着而且早餐非常差，简直就是没东西吃。,"The hotel is older, near the airport, you can hear a lot of noise.The air conditioner is not turned on. The smell in the window house is dizzy. The window opening is basically noisy and the breakfast is very bad. It is just nothing to eat."
1,住在这里感觉很舒服心情很好，有什么问题都能得到及时地解决，不管是大堂副理还是服务员都是很专业的，服务水准一流。早餐很丰富，旋转餐厅能看到玄武湖。,"I feel very comfortable to live here, and I can get it in time in a timely manner. Whether it is the deputy manager of the lobby or the waiter, it is very professional, and the service level is first -rate.Breakfast is rich, and the rotating restaurant can see Xuanwu Lake."
1,前几天入住了这个酒店，感觉环境很不错啊！到处都是绿地和鲜花，我早上起得很早，发现空气质量真是不错，还有很多小鸟，都是上海那样的大城市所感受不到的，而且这里离机场特别近，只要过条马路就好了，事先没想到那么近，联系酒店接机，结果1分钟就到了，接机的工作人员也很热情啊！帮忙拿行李什么的，还帮忙送到房间里，真的很感谢。以后还会去的。就是太大了点，走得累,"I checked in this hotel a few days ago, and I feel that the environment is very good!There are green spaces and flowers everywhere. I got up early in the morning and found that the quality of the air was really good. There are many birds that are not felt by big cities like Shanghai, and it is very close to the airport.That's it. I didn't expect to be so close in advance. Contact the hotel to pick up the plane. As a result, it was arrived in 1 minute.Thank you so much for helping with your luggage or something, and for helping him to the room.I will go in the future.It's a bit big, I am tired of walking"
0,1.令我最大的遗憾是，热水竟然不热。还好是夏天没感冒。2.电视上面一个机顶盒子是坏的我也懒得修了3.四星级酒店竟然没有西式早餐。完全都是猪油的菜，我只能吃伴黄瓜和油条。而且中餐实在是太难吃了。4.服务还是可以的。5.酒店内部设施实在是不配4星级称号，太旧太烂了。6.网速并不象其他人说的那么快，可能截流了，也就一般的速度,"1. The biggest regret for me is that the hot water is not hot.Fortunately, there is no cold in summer.2. The top box on the TV is bad. I was too lazy to repair it. 3. The four -star hotel has no western breakfast.It's all lard dishes. I can only eat cucumber and fritters.And Chinese food is really ugly.4. Service is still possible.5. The internal facilities of the hotel are really not worthy of 4 -star titles, which are too old and bad.6. The speed of the network is not as fast as others say, it may be intercepted, and the general speed"
1,这家如家地段不算太好，所以感觉性价比不是太好，下次不去了。,"This family is not very good, so it feels that the price / performance ratio is not very good. I won't go next time."
0,入住感想如下、共大家参考:1、典型的国营招待所、除了有个很小的小卖部外什么都没有。2、房间设施陈旧、毫无住宾馆的感觉。3、谈不上服务、电视遥控器不管用、打电话给前台后、直至离店也未送来。4、浴室没有垫地的毛巾。建议后来的朋友、千万不要住这里。另外、希望携程应对酒店进行评比、不符合要求的店不要推荐、否则给客人造成不便。,"The feelings of staying are as follows, and everyone reference: 1. Typical state -owned guest houses, there is nothing except for a small seller.2. Old room facilities and feelings without staying in the hotel.3. Can't talk about service, TV remote control, regardless of whether it is used, calls the front desk, and it has not been delivered until the store is left.4. There are no towels in the bathroom.It is recommended that later friends, do not live here.In addition, I hope that Ctrip responds to the hotel's evaluation, and do not recommend it, otherwise it will cause inconvenience to customers."
0,实话实说，此酒店实在不行，428的套房居然只是一张大床和一张小床，再加个桌子，浴缸没有，热水要好几分钟才能出来，最寒碜的是早餐，早餐是两个馒头，一点点面条，一碗稀饭，我实在想不通凭啥收费这么贵？我把早餐都拍照存档，如果要你们可以实地考察！什么双早，忽悠人呢！,"To be honest, this hotel is really not good. The 428 suite is actually just a large bed and a small bed.A little noodle, a bowl of porridge, I really can't figure out why it is so expensive?I take a picture of breakfast and archive, if you want you to check on the spot!What are the early early, flicker!"
1,房间很干净。餐厅饭菜一般般。可惜没有独立的沙滩，需要步行一段路才能到海边。补充点评2007年12月13日：价格比较实惠。,"The room is very clean.Restaurant meals are general.Unfortunately, there is no independent beach, you need to walk for a while to reach the beach.Supplementary comment on December 13, 2007: The price is more affordable."
1,酒店设施有点陈旧，但地处市中心地带，交通方便，服务也很好，携程的预定价格很公道，可以作为一个出差的选择,"The hotel facilities are a bit old, but it is located in the city center, convenient transportation, and good service. Ctrip's predetermined price is fair. It can be used as a business trip."
1,还行。因为是帮朋友订的，没有听说有啥不好的。总体感觉还可以的,"good.Because I booked it for a friend, I didn't hear that there was something bad.Overall feeling is okay"
1,"酒店离市中心公共交通不是很方便,打的一般在11-12元。酒店的早餐很丰富，考虑的很周到。有粥、面条、蛋糕等等，牛奶是鲜奶。","The hotel is not very convenient for public transportation from the city center, and it is generally 11-12 yuan.The hotel's breakfast is very rich and considerate.There are porridge, noodles, cakes, etc., milk is fresh milk."
1,我住的A楼的豪华大床房，248元，房间很宽敞，干净。床也够大。宽带速度不错。但由于临近步行街，对面又有一个娱乐场所，所以无论早晚都很吵。不好热闹的朋友最好选择B楼。建议酒店加强一下隔音措施。前台的服务态度很好，但提醒需要使用信用卡预授权的朋友，酒店不能取消预授权（至少我是遇到了），要一个月后才能自动取消，在解决这个事情的过程中，前台服务员一直很热情，反而一个看起来像是大堂经理麽样的女人（戴眼镜），对我的询问很是不耐烦。另外携程的价格根本没有任何优势！早餐还算是物有所值的。总体来说，在要求不高的情况下还是值得一住的。,"The luxurious large bed room on Building A, 248 yuan, the room is very spacious and clean.The bed is big enough.Broadband speed is good.However, because there is another entertainment place on the opposite side of the pedestrian street, there is no no matter how no matter sooner or later.It is best to choose Brise B.It is recommended to strengthen the sound insulation measures.The service attitude of the front desk is very good, but friends who need to use credit card pre -authorized friends, the hotel cannot cancel pre -authorization (at least I have encountered it).Passion, but a woman (wearing glasses) that looks like a lobby manager, is very impatient to ask me.In addition, Ctrip's price has no advantage at all!Breakfast is worthwhile.Overall, it is worth living when the requirements are not high."
1,房间面积很大，服务尚可，总的来说还满意。,The room is large and the service is acceptable.
1,总体不错，价格实惠，就是酒店周围的环境较差，乱哄哄的样子，房间也还不错，大堂的CheckIn的时候还算好，退房的时候实在是太慢了。主要的缺陷在4，5和6楼是对外开放的娱乐场所，形形色色的进进出出大大降低了酒店的品位，尤其是商务酒店的品位。,"The overall is good, the price is affordable, that is, the environment around the hotel is poor, chaotic, and the rooms are not bad. The checkin in the lobby is pretty good, and it is too slow when checking out.The main defects are on the 4th, 5th, and 6th floors are open entertainment venues to the outside world. The inlets of various colors have greatly reduced the taste of the hotel, especially the taste of business hotels."
0,免费接机用的轿车。宽带上网只是一个摆设，根本不能上网，叫了几次前台也没有解决，最后只能用电话线拨号。我住的客房面对公路，隔音效果不好，早上卡车经过很吵。晚上有小姐骚扰电话。对面有韩国旅行团入住，小姐进出频繁。听朋友说那里的小姐比较宰客，谈好的价钱只是台费，最后还会另收天价小费，不给的话，会有鸡头进来跟你谈，挺恐怖的，最好不要尝试。,"Free pick -up car.Broadband Internet access is just a decoration. It cannot be surfed at all. I called the front desk and did not solve it a few times. In the end, I could only dial with the telephone line.The room I lived in facing the road, the sound insulation effect was not good, and the truck was noisy in the morning.In the evening, there was a lady harassing call.On the opposite side, there is a Korean tour group, and the lady is frequent in and out.Listening to my friends said that the lady there is more slaughtered. The price is only a Taiwan fee. In the end, there will be a small price tip. If you do n’t give it, there will be chicken heads to talk to you. It ’s very scary. It is best not to try it."
1,这家号称四星级房间装修一般一般不过地段好得不行离海边也近占地面积很大房子的格调就像蓬莱阁一样的灰瓦白墙五一期间的价格300/晚可以接受就是有一个特别不满意的地方在前台付的现金押金最后退房时居然告知不能刷卡消费也就是说付押金的时候选择预授权就可以刷卡消费付押金的时候付现金就不能刷卡消费这实在不符合这个星级标准有够死板建议即将入住的朋友们注意这点,"The decoration of this four -star room is generally not as good as the location is so good that it is close to the seaside and the style of a large area of houses is like Penglai Pavilion.The cash deposit paid at the front desk in a particularly dissatisfied place actually notified that the card consumption can not be swiped when you check out, which means that when you choose to pay the deposit, you can swipe the card and pay the deposit.There are enough rigids to be rigid. Friends who are about to stay pay attention to this"
0,第一次到贵阳，通过携程订了两晚。说是三星。走进房间，发现设施太旧，卫生条件不如人意。地毯太脏还有洞，墙壁已经发黄了，本想退掉一晚。后来上街，发现整个贵阳的城市建设都不怎么样，所以将就着住了两晚。,"For the first time I arrived in Guiyang, I booked two nights through Ctrip.Say it is Samsung.When I walked into the room, I found that the facilities were too old, and the sanitary conditions were not satisfactory.The carpet is too dirty and has a hole. The wall is already yellow. I wanted to retreat for one night.Later, I was on the street and found that the city's urban construction was not good, so I lived for two nights."
0,"据说这是泰山上最高级的酒店,3星的,但自从我们一进酒店大门就发现,这个在山下只能算是1星的标准吧,房间里有股发霉的味道,床单上面还有上一位客人(或着是上...上位客人)遗留下的血渍,当时就觉得太恶心了,卫生间也小的可怜,而且灯光昏暗,里面免费提供的毛巾等卫生用品都脏的没办法用,只好使用了需要付费的毛巾,可10元一条的小毛巾,竟然掉毛无数,接下来擦化妆品的时候,脸上直搓球:(由于我们到达泰山的时间实在是当天游览不完,而且主要是想看日出,没办法,只好将就着住了.再来说下这酒店里的餐厅,到达的当天我们在那里吃的晚饭,一进入餐厅,仿佛到了80年代的职工大食堂,一股哈喇油味,可我们已经很疲惫了,不想再回到天街那里去找别的饭店,再说了,最好的三星级酒店的餐厅都这样,小饭店的卫生水准就更不敢想象了?!我和老公只点了炒鸡蛋,大米饭,烧茄子,毕竟这样还比较卫生,如果点肉,鱼之类,真怕是变质的.....味道还可以吧,第二天的早餐不贵,好象也就20元左右,但实在是没什么品种,而且苍蝇乱飞,菜都吃没了,服务员也不及时添,我们只吃了煮鸡蛋,白粥,咸菜,觉得这几样还比较能保证卫生.总之,这个宾馆实在是太差了,可这竟然还是最高级别的,据说以前国家领导人来了都住这里,真想不明白,领导人怎么会住在这种酒店呢????多么美的泰山,竟然配套的服务业这么差,这么低标准,真是难以理解!!!!P.S上山下山坐的游览车,开的实在是太疯狂了,100多道弯,每个弯都不见减速,真是把心提到嗓子眼儿了,以后是不想再去了.","It is said that this is the most advanced hotel on Taishan, 3 stars, but since we entered the door of the hotel, we found that this can only be regarded as 1 star standard at the mountain. There is a moldy taste in the room.The blood stain left by the guests (or the upper guest) was too disgusting at that time, the bathroom was small and poor, and the lights were dim. The free toilet supplies such as towels inside were dirty.I had to use a towel to pay, a small towel that could be 10 yuan, and there were countless hair loss. When I wipe the cosmetics next, the face was rubbed straight: (Because the time when we arrived in Taishan was endless, and the main is the main day, and the main main day, and the main main day, the main main dayI want to watch the sunrise, there is no way, I have to live in it. Let's talk about the restaurant in this hotel. On the day of arrival, we ate dinner there and entered the restaurant.Hara oil flavor, but we are already exhausted, we don't want to go back to Tianjie to find other restaurants. Besides, the best three -star hotel restaurants are like this, and the sanitary level of small restaurants will not even dare to imagine•! My husband and I only ordered the fried eggs, rice, and roasted eggplant. After all, this is relatively hygienic. If you order meat, fish and the like, you are afraid of deterioration ...The breakfast is not expensive, it seems to be about 20 yuan, but there are really no varieties, and the flies are flying around, the dishes are gone, and the waiters will not add timely. We only eat eggs, white porridge, picklesIt can also ensure hygiene. In short, this hotel is too bad, but this is still the highest. It is said that the national leaders came here before. I really don’t understand how the leaders live in this hotel.What a beautiful Taishan, the matching service industry is so bad, such low standards, it is really difficult to understand !!!! P.S goes up the mountain and go down the mountain.I did n’t see the deceleration when I bend. I really mentioned my heart to my throat. I do n’t want to go again in the future."
1,"房间比较宽敞,环境还不错,交通也还方便,最大的缺憾就是就餐不便,酒店只有较贵的早餐,二楼的餐厅倒闭了.好在周围有些饭店和便当店可以自己解决,总之,在上海住这样的酒店,性价比还不错!","The room is relatively spacious, the environment is not bad, and the traffic is also convenient. The biggest regret is that the meal is inconvenient. The hotel has only more expensive breakfast, and the restaurant on the second floor is closed. Fortunately, some restaurants and bento shops around you can solve it by yourself. In short, in ShanghaiLiving in such a hotel, the cost performance is not bad!"
1,7/22-7/24入住的，房间还不错，能看到整个海景，酒店的服务也不错。不过还是有些小瑕疵，浴缸里上批住客的头发没有清理干净，导致放水的时候，头发都漂浮上来，很恶心。还有就是酒店的餐饮实在是没有达到4星的标准，吃的东西选择很少，晚上去吃的自助餐东西也很少。还没有上海一般的自助餐的一半吧。,"7/22-7/24, the room is not bad, you can see the entire sea view, and the hotel's service is also good.However, there are still some small flaws. The hair on the bathtub was not cleaned up, which caused the hair to float when the water was released, and it was disgusting.There is also the hotel's catering does not meet the standard of 4 stars. There are very few choices for food, and there are very few buffet foods to eat at night.There is no half of the buffets in Shanghai."
1,酒店还不错，服务态度也蛮好。早餐不算丰富但也凑合。不过有一点非常不好，就是房间隔音非常差。第一晚隔壁那个小孩晚上哭了一晚，早上比闹钟还准时又哭一大场。第二晚隔壁住了韩国乡巴佬，叫了小姐，又是吵吵闹闹一晚上。唉。。。基本上隔壁发生什么事情，这边都能听得清清楚楚。,"The hotel is not bad, and the service attitude is pretty good.Breakfast is not rich but also together.But one thing is very bad, that is, the sound insulation is very poor.On the first night, the child cried for one night at night, and he cried on time than the alarm clock in the morning.The next night, I lived in the Baba guy of South Korea, called Miss, and noisy one night.well.EssenceEssenceBasically, what happened next door can be heard clearly here."
0,今天刚从武义回来，特别来说一下入住的新宇明招温泉国际大酒店1/12:00左右到达的酒店，checkin的时候被告知我们订的商务大床房没了，只剩下标房。（因为是在携程上预定的，所以钱已经付掉了）之后，我们的领队和他们的销售人员去核对订单，查下来发现我们确实是订了商务大床房，再让我们等了半个多小时之后，终于给了我们别人刚退的房间。之后，由于要清洁，我们又在门外等了二十多分钟，终于进了房。2/因晚上19：00有泡温泉的安排，所以想早些解决晚餐。17：20的时候拨打客房送餐服务，服务人员说这段时间没有送餐服务。我想可能节日期间比较忙，也就没有在意。那我们就直奔餐厅，17：30点完菜直到一小时之后上了第一个菜，其他客人的桌子上也是放着一两个空盘子，并无上菜迹象。其间催了小姐好几次，完全置之不理。因为赶时间，我只能亲自跑到厨房间，催着他们把一个菜送出来，然后自己把菜端上桌。这个时候，已将近七点，我们决定买单，其他没有上的菜不要了，即使肚子还是空空的。之后里面的小姐端着不知谁家的菜，一个个桌子的问，场面之混乱，实在令人啼笑皆非。3/浴室的水温不稳定。要么很烫，没有触碰笼头的情况下，又一下子变得很凉。以上这些因素直接影响了我们在旅途中的心情，作为一家四星级的酒店，实在很难想象它的服务竟是如此，希望能有所改进！,"I just returned from Wuyi today. In particular, the hotel where Xinyu Mingzhao Hot Spring International Hotel stayed in was at a hotel where around 1/12: 00 arrived at the hotel. When I was checin, I was told that the big business bedroom we ordered was gone, leaving only the benchmarking room.(Because it was booked on Ctrip, so after the money has been paid), our leader and their sales staff check the orders. After checking it, we found that we have ordered a large business bed room.After many hours, we finally gave us the just retreat.After that, we waited for more than 20 minutes because of cleaning, and finally entered the room.2/Because there is a hot spring arrangement at 19:00 in the evening, I want to solve dinner earlier.At 17:20, the guest room delivery service was called, and the service staff said that there was no food delivery service during this time.I think it may be busy during the festival, so I didn't care.Then we went straight to the restaurant. At 17:30, the first dish was put on the first dish until one hour later. There were one or two empty plates on the tables of other guests, and there were no signs of dishes.The lady was urged several times, and she was completely ignored.Because I was in a hurry, I could only run to the kitchen in person, urged them to send out a dish, and then put the dishes on the table by myself.At this time, it was almost seven o'clock, and we decided to pay. Other dishes that were not available were unnecessary, even if the belly was empty.After that, the lady inside was not knowing who the dishes, and the tables were asked, and the chaos of the scene was really ridiculous.3/The water temperature in the bathroom is unstable.Either it was hot and did not touch the cage head, and it became very cold.The above factors directly affect our mood during the journey. As a four -star hotel, it is really difficult to imagine its service. I hope it can be improved!"
1,实在很舒服的度假山庄，没有一般度假区的市侩的感觉，有家的感觉，越王山比我想象中的刺激，不过那些木走廊过道需要维护一下了，不然很容易出事。房间很舒服，床拼起来很大，服务挺好，就是餐厅苍蝇比较多。,"The very comfortable resort, there is no feeling of the city's cricket in the general resort, and the feeling of home. Yuewangshan is more exciting than I think, but those wooden corridors need to be maintained, otherwise it is easy to accident.The room is very comfortable, the bed is very large, and the service is very good, that is, there are more flies in the restaurant."
1,本次入住的是商务大床房，房间不错，很大，灯光协调，落地玻璃窗视野宽广，地理位置也很方便，服务人员非常周到（不小心把裤子的扣子绷掉了，呵呵，太胖了，服务员很快就替我钉好了），笑容也非常可爱，价钱在5星里面也算合适。大堂的装修设计应该有些年限了，显得有点过时和俗气，不过这到不影响居住质量,"This time I stayed in a large business bed room. The rooms were good, very large, coordinated with light, wide floor -to -ceiling windows, and convenient geographical location. The service staff were very thoughtful (accidentally stretched out the buttons of the pantsThe waiter quickly nailed me), and the smile was very cute, and the price was appropriate in 5 stars.The decoration design of the lobby should have some years, and it seems a bit outdated and tacky, but this does not affect the quality of living."
1,虽然酒店的房间一般，略微有点潮，有待改进，但是服务很贴心。性价比不错。优质的服务让人非常满意。满足需求，想人所想。赞！,"Although the hotel's room is average, it is slightly tide and needs to be improved, but the service is intimate.Good cost -effective.High -quality services are very satisfactory.Meet the needs and think about it.Thumbs up!"
1,离火车站、长途汽车站很近，打车起价就到（五分钟内），楼下有24小时营业的麦当劳（点餐可免费送至房间），出大门往左便是平原商场，其对面是影剧院。,It is very close to the railway station and long -distance bus station. The starting price of the taxi is (within five minutes). McDonald's operating 24 hours downstairs (can be delivered to the room for free for free).Theater.
1,与几月前相比变化不大用餐便捷实惠客房干净整洁,"Compared with a few months ago, the changes are not large and the room is clean and neat."
0,8月4日入住了该酒店，没想到很多地方不如意，不得不缩短行程，提前返京。之前在网上查询，想住一个特色酒店，就选择此处的豪华标准间。但没想到：（1）酒店周围正在拆迁，非常脏和吵。出租车司机让我们三年以后看，说一定变样。分配给我们的房子临马路，面对一大施工场，极其嘈杂。不得以要求将其中的两间房调换。前台很不情愿给换了，告知换的房子会比这个小。当时为求安静，只好同意，但后来发现上大当了。（2）调换的两间房估计为普通标准间，屋子里墙壁和柜橱有斑驳的潮湿痕迹，其中一间屋子抽水马桶经常坏。房间很小，书桌和床之间仅容一人过。最可恶的是窗户没有纱窗，且朝过道，冒着进蚊子的威胁，开窗后发现无法通气，因过道窗户紧紧封闭，房间里一股霉味和油漆味散发不出去。更有甚者，因是围拢的房屋结构，早晚有人在过道说话很闹，且过道的灯笼整夜亮着。透过菲薄的窗帘，不得不忍受光污染。屋子的隔音效果很差，需要忍受隔壁看电视的声音。没有中央空调。（3）服务水平一般。在调换房间的第二天，讯问前台要求换到豪华标间，前台说因是自己要求调换的，不补差价，且说现房即为折后338元的价位。这可是在承德！前台服务很差，虽身着民族服装很漂亮，但态度冷冰冰。但对我之前的一老外可是鞠躬哈腰的。（4）早餐难以下咽。因周围是村庄，只能在酒店用早餐。四五个小咸菜；两种粥、豆包、包子以及奶粉冲得很稀的牛奶。即便这种早餐过了八点半还就没有了。开始打扫卫生，不管是否客人吃完。我非常非常后悔选择了这个酒店，性价比最差的。本想休息几天，但住宿实在太差，干脆一家人，勉强住了两夜就退房走人。,"I stayed at the hotel on August 4th. I did not expect that many places were unsatisfactory and had to shorten the itinerary and returned to Beijing in advance.Inquiring online, if you want to stay in a special hotel, choose the luxury standard room here.But I did not expect: (1) The hotel is being demolished around the hotel, which is very dirty and noisy.Taxi drivers let us see three years later, saying that it will change.The house assigned to our house is extremely noisy in the face of a large construction ground.It is not required to change the two houses.The front desk was reluctant to change it, and the house that was notified would be smaller than this.At that time, in order to be quiet, I had to agree, but later I discovered it.(2) The two rooms that are replaced are estimated to be ordinary standard rooms. The walls and cabinets in the room have mottled wet traces. One of the houses in the house is often bad.The room is very small, and only one person can be allowed between the desk and the bed.The most disgusting thing is that the window has no screens, and it is towards the aisle, and the threat of mosquitoes is rushing into the mosquito. After opening the window, it is found that the aisle window is tightly closed, and a mildew and paint flavor in the room cannot be exuded.What's more, because the structure of the surrounding house, someone spoke in the aisle sooner or later, and the lanterns on the aisle were on all night.Through the thin curtains, it has to endure light pollution.The sound insulation effect of the house is very poor, and you need to endure the sound of watching TV next door.There is no central air conditioner.(3) The service level is average.On the second day of the conversion room, interrogation asked the front desk to be replaced with a luxury standard room. The front desk said that because it was required to be replaced, the difference was not made up, and the current house was the price of 338 yuan after it was discounted.This is in Chengde!The front desk service is very poor. Although we are in national costumes, they are very cold.But a foreigner for me was bowing.(4) Breakfast is difficult to swallow.Because there are villages around, you can only take breakfast at the hotel.Four or five little pickles; two kinds of porridge, bean buns, buns, and milk powder with very sparse milk.Even if this breakfast is 8:30, it is gone.Start cleaning, whether the guests finish eating.I regret choosing this hotel very much, and the worst price is.I wanted to rest for a few days, but the accommodation was too bad. I simply left the house and left the house for a long time."
0,今天是6月27日，离我在汉庭快捷酒店（上海新虹桥店）住宿2月有余（我与4月12日入住），其它的事我已记不清楚，但是离店结账产生的麻烦至今困扰我，当日，通过携程订的是2间246元的高级大床房，总价是492元。当时入住办手续一切顺利，服务生拿出携程订单，打单刷卡有条不紊，我拿单签字，当然我注意的是刷卡签单，预授权800元，没有核对服务生打出的另外的每张单据的每个字符，第二天离店结账，麻烦来了，再次刷卡签单时，我发现刷了568元，我拒绝签单，与我的预订不同，此时服务生拿出我昨天的一把签单讲，我住的是284元的高级大床房，晕，忽悠我昨天的不细心，昨天没有任何提示，今天要我买单，我与服务生理论，最后服务主管同意按492元结账，似乎一切都已结束，然而并未如此，服务生给我的卡刷了2次，一次是492元，我同意签单给他，另一张568元，我拒绝签字，收回单据。然而，当我收到银行的对账单时，我还是发现被扣款2次，我致电该酒店，答应查询后给予答复，至今未收到任何回复，后与银行方面联系，其中我多次与银行联系，银行终于在6月13日退回492元（估计银行与该店进行了N次交涉），6月25日左右，银行致电我讲退回492元，我核对后再次将此情况反映给银行，应该退回568元，再次讲了我没有签单的账单还是被扣款了，我在等待著银行交涉之后的结果。不知这次还要等待多长时间--------------------,"Today is June 27, and I stay at the Hanking Express Hotel (Shanghai Xinhongqiao Store) in February (I stayed in with April 12).So far, I have troubled me. On the same day, I ordered two high -end bedrooms with a 246 yuan through Ctrip, with a total price of 492 yuan.At that time, everything was smooth, and the waiter took out Ctrip orders, and the single -swipe card was methodical. I took a single sign. Of course, I paid attention to the sign of the card, pre -authorized 800 yuan, and there was no other documents per document for the waiter.The character, the next day left the store to check out, the trouble came. When I swiped the card again, I found that I brushed 568 yuan. I refused to sign the order. Unlike my booking, at this time, the waiter took out my yesterday's sign.I live in a high -end bedroom of 284 yuan, dizzy, flickering I was not careful yesterday. I didn't have any prompts yesterday. Today I want me to pay for it. I have the theory of the waiter.At the end, it was not the case. The waiter gave me the card twice, one at a time of 492 yuan. I agreed to sign the bill, and the other one was 568 yuan. I refused to sign and recovered the document.However, when I received a bank statement from the bank, I found that I was deducted twice. I called the hotel and agreed to give a reply after the inquiry. I have not received any reply so far.The bank contacts, the bank finally returned 492 yuan on June 13 (it is estimated that the bank and the store negotiated N times). Around June 25, the bank called me to return 492 yuan.It should be returned to 568 yuan. I talked again that I had not signed the bill or was deducted. I was waiting for the bank to negotiate.I don't know how long I have to wait this time --------------------------------------------------------"
1,"只能说赣州最高档的四星酒店还有待加强,是多少感觉有四星的配备,有些用的是进口货,但整体跟其他城市四星相比可能只有3星,整理基本上还ok,早餐再多点花样会更好","It can only be said that the highest -end four -star hotel in Ganzhou still needs to be strengthened. How much is the equipment with four -star, some use imported goods, but the overall four -star 4 -star may only be 3 stars.More more tricks will be better"
0,首先，对携程的订房提点意见，明明订了新蜀联，说有房，做了信用卡担保，立马就赶去，到前台查说携程没订，而且酒店那时也没房了，正好携程电话过来了，解释说刚才和新蜀联联系没房了，叫我们换。行，那就换吧，但是等了20分钟才落实，哎呀，真不爽，头一次遇到这种情况，携程的服务是不是倒退了！？这家酒店是携程推荐的（估计当时也只有这家了），酒店前台不错，遗忘了身份证还能在第二天一早打电话到房间核实，这点很好，没有在晚上打搅休息。酒店房间一般，肯定不值755元，另外酒店的代客泊车有问题，退房后我们就拿着行李在门口等了足足半小时，有点气人。补充点评2008年3月21日：还有，导游是不是在前台有优先特权，我们很老实的排队，但是导游就可以在人缝里挤的很自由，而且接待员就当什么都没看见，照样给她办。没弄明白，好像我们在酒店住宿是赊账？,"First of all, the opinion of Ctrip's booking was made, and Xinshu Lian was clearly booked, saying that there was a house, a credit card guarantee, and immediately rushed to the front desk to check that Ctrip did not book, and the hotel had no house at that time.The phone came over, explaining that I had no room with Xinshu Lian just now, and told us to change it.Okay, then change it, but after 20 minutes of implementation, oops, it's uncomfortable. For the first time encountered this situation, is Ctrip's service backward!IntersectionThis hotel was recommended by Ctrip (it is estimated that there was only this at the time). The hotel's front desk is good. Forgot to forget the ID card, you can call the room early the next morning to verify it. This is very good and did not disturb the rest at night.The hotel room is generally worth 755 yuan. In addition, there is a problem with the hotel's valet parking. After checking out, we waited for half an hour with our luggage at the door, which was a bit angry.Supplementary comment on March 21, 2008: Also, do the tour guide have priority privileges in the front desk, we are honestly lined up, but the tour guide can be squeezed in the seam very freely, and the receptionist should not see anything.Do it for her.I don't understand, it seems that we stay in the hotel as a tilted account?"
1,成都的凯宾是我入住国内凯宾设施最好，服务态度最好，周围吃、住、行、购物最便捷的。,"Kaibin in Chengdu is the best in my domestic Kaibin facilities, the best service attitude, and the most convenient to eat, live, travel, and shopping."
1,住过几次了，谈点儿意见：1.交通方便；2.房间够干净；3.有报纸看；4.窗帘拉不严，住过的房间都这样；5.早晨8：00不到，服务员就来按门铃、敲门，问有没有脏衣服要洗；6.服务员有时在楼道里大声聊天。,"I have lived several times, and talk about it: 1. Convenient transportation; 2. The room is clean enough; 3. It has a newspaper to see; 4. The curtains are not strict, and the rooms you have lived are like this;The waiter came to the doorbell and knocked on the door, and asked if there was any dirty clothes to wash; 6. The waiter sometimes chats loudly in the corridor."
1,尽管距离杭州有不止四十分钟的车程，且下高速路后到酒店也需要十多分钟，周边也没什么景色，但还是大力推荐此度假村，一则家庭套餐极为实惠，复式房可住三代人，顶层阁楼带天窗的房间超大，且有晚上仰望星空的浪漫。二则酒店的服务态度很好，我的车深夜发生故障，大堂经理连夜找市区的修理厂上门修理，下班了还多次来电关心修理进度，很感动。,"Although there are more than 40 minutes from Hangzhou, it takes more than ten minutes to go to the hotel after going down the highway, and there is no scenery around. However, this resort is highly recommended. A family package is extremely affordable. The duplex houses can live in three generations.The room with the skylight with the skylight is large, and there is the romance of looking up at the starry sky at night.The service attitude of the two hotels was very good. My car failed late at night. The lobby manager went to the city's repair shop to repair it overnight. After get off work, he repeatedly charged and caring for the repair progress. It was very moved."
1,武夷山邮电宾馆提供的免费接站很周到，房间很安静，酒店的回廊可以看到远处的武夷山脉，环境还算幽雅。打车去景区很方便，离附近三姑街步行5分钟距离，可以去那里解决用餐的问题，品尝农家野味，经济实惠。,"The free pick -ups provided by Wuyi Mountain Post and Telecommunications Hotel are very thoughtful. The room is very quiet. The corridor of the hotel can see the Wuyi Mountains in the distance, and the environment is quite elegant.It is very convenient to take a taxi to the scenic area. Walking 5 minutes away from the nearby Sangu Street, you can go there to solve the problem of dining, taste the farmhouses, and economical."
0,我是10月4日入住的这家酒店，这是我住过得最差的酒店，服务不好，酒店设施超陈旧，说是早上7点到9：30有早餐提供，但我们8点多下楼就说只有面条了，服务员还一种爱吃不吃的样子，去任何地方都不方便，最近的地铁站也要走路15到20分钟，我们是下午三点的车，要求延时2个小时，总服务台就说要加半天房费，之前住过的四星也没这么苛刻，而且房间和网上发的图片不符，我不知道是不是因为携程的会员价比较便宜才会给那么不好的房间，总之以后再也不会去住这家店。,"I am in this hotel where I stayed on on October 4th. This is the worst hotel I have stayed.After going downstairs, there is only noodles, and the waiter also likes to eat or not. It is not convenient to go anywhere. The nearest subway station will also walk for 15 to 20 minutes. We are a car at 3 pm.In an hour, the general service desk said that the house fee would be added for a long time. The four -star I have lived before is not so harsh, and the room and the pictures sent online are inconsistent. I don’t know if it is because the membership price of Ctrip is cheaper.In a bad room, I will never live in this store anymore."
1,最近大半年（2007）的周末都是住在这家酒店的。价格适合560元的高级房还是不错的。酒店的服务态度相当好，门童很客气，设施也蛮好的。酒店的销售做得也不错，时常看到一个大团入住。出租车还是蛮好叫的，门口是周家嘴路主要通道，可以去市中心。停车有时候有点紧张。总之，这是一家值得住的酒店！,"In the last half of the year (2007), we have lived in this hotel.The price is suitable for senior houses with 560 yuan.The hotel's service attitude is quite good, the door children are very polite, and the facilities are pretty good.The sales of the hotel are doing well, and I often see a large group staying.The taxi is quite good. At the door is the main channel of Zhoujiazui, you can go to the center of the city.Sometimes parking is a bit nervous.In short, this is a worthy hotel!"
1,"环境不错,地点也很好!下次还会入住!",The environment is good and the location is very good! I will stay in the next time!
0,如家店的地址都是很偏僻的，不在主干道上，我要求携程帮我订一间楼层稍高的房间，为了安静一点，结果入住是给我一间1楼，真的很高！！！房间的电视机根本没法看，反正这次的预定是非常不让人满意的！！！！,"If the address of the house is very remote, I am not on the main road. I asked Ctrip to help me book a slightly taller room. For the sake of quiet, the check -in was for me a first floor. It was really high!IntersectionIntersectionThe television of the room can't be watched at all. Anyway, the reservation this time is very unsatisfactory!IntersectionIntersectionIntersection"
0,"酒店位置较偏,而且管理混乱.价格过高,不划算.","The hotel location is relatively biased, and the management is chaotic. The price is too high and it is not cost -effective."
0,毛巾等东西太旧了，而且连小方巾也没有，瓶装水也没有，这些小处没看出是个四星，唯一的好处就是离江近。,"The towels and other things are too old, and there are no small square towels, and there are no bottle water. These small places do not see that they are a four -star. The only advantage is that it is close to the river."
1,订的是厦门宾馆的5号楼，很安静，房间很干净、宽敞、舒适，服务也很不错。宾馆的地理位置很方便，到厦大、轮渡都只要起步费，而且宾馆本身是花园宾馆，也很漂亮。还有，送的双早也很不错。总之，非常喜欢的宾馆，下次去厦门一定还会住的。,"The Xiamen Hotel is set by Building 5 of Xiamen Hotel. It is very quiet. The room is very clean, spacious and comfortable. The service is also very good.The geographical location of the hotel is very convenient. As long as you go to Xiamen University and the ferry, the hotel itself is a garden hotel itself, which is also very beautiful.Also, the doubles they sent are also very good.In short, I really like a hotel that I like to stay in Xiamen next time."
0,应该说酒店的性价比还是不错的，但是个别客服人员的服务实在是不敢恭维，因此让我对这个酒店产生了很大的反感，下次绝对不会再去住了。我是25号那天入住，住在709，当天晚上睡到一点半的时候，被外面走廊上的喧哗声吵醒。起来看才发现是对面房间和隔壁几个房间的客人在外面大声说话，跑来跑去，持续了二十多分钟，没有一个客服人员出来制止和协调，我想努力入睡，但是声音实在太嘈杂。我就打电话给前台，希望前台处理一下。结果前台告诉我那是几个喝醉酒的人，刚入住，可能过一会儿就好了。我说已经很长时间了，你们能不能找个人上来看一下，确实已经影响休息了，我发誓，我当时的态度非常客气，甚至有点恳求的意味，结果前台小姐说什么，说：我们也没有办法。我当时气的把电话挂了，想不行就再等等，他们也不可能闹一晚上吧，等到两点半，还是很吵，我又打电话给保安，保安答应上来制止，但是等了很久，都没有保安出现，外面还是很闹，再等到3点半，外面还是没有消停的迹象，我又给保安打电话，保安又答应了，但还是没有人来，外面也还是很闹。我实在没办法，睡不着了，只有起床上网。这件事情让我对这个酒店的印象太差，作为酒店，有义务为住客提供安全和舒适的入住环境，但是这个酒店却没做到，而且工作人员在处理这件事情上的态度却让人寒心。我绝对不会再去住了。,"It should be said that the cost -effectiveness of the hotel is still good, but the services of individual customer service staff are really dare not compliment. Therefore, I have made me a lot of disgusting to this hotel, and I will never live again next time.I stayed on the 25th and lived in 709. When I slept until a:30 that night, I was awakened by the noise on the outside corridor.When I got up, I found that it was the opposite room and the guests in the next room talking loudly outside, running around for more than 20 minutes. No customer service staff came out to stop and coordinate.EssenceI called the front desk and hoped to deal with the front desk.As a result, the front desk told me a few drunk people. As soon as I stayed, I might be fine after a while.I said it has been a long time. Can you find someone to take a look at it? It has indeed affected the rest. I swear that my attitude was very polite and even a little begging.Method.I hung up the phone angrily at that time, and waited again if I couldn't think of it. They couldn't make a night. When I waited for two:30, I was still very noisy. I called the security guard again. The security guard promised to stop it, but after waiting for a long timeThere are no security guards, and the outside is still very troublesome. Wait until 3:30. There is still no sign of stopping outside. I called the security guard again. The security guard agreed again, but no one came, and the outside was still very troubled.I can't help but sleep, only getting up to go online.This incident made me impressed by this hotel. As a hotel, I have the obligation to provide guests with a safe and comfortable check -in environment, but this hotel has not done it, and the attitude of the staff in handling this matter makesPeople are chilling.I will never live again."
0,此酒店硬件设施非常差，比如：房间是KTV包房改的，被子很薄，早餐在简陋的包房里就餐（早餐太简单），服务员叼着烟往餐厅里送早餐，大堂只有一个男女公用的卫生间，里面还放着两辆自行车，等我到了酒店服务员还找不到我的订单等等。所有这些都是客观事实，并非我捏造。,"This hotel's hardware facilities are very poor. For example, the room was changed in KTV private rooms, the quilt was very thin, and the quilt was very thin. Breakfast was dinner in a humble private room (breakfast is too simple).The bathroom, there are two bicycles inside, when I arrived at the hotel waiter, I couldn't find my order and so on.All these are objective facts, not my fabrication."
0,"前天入住,感觉没有上次好,2年前住过同一个房间,现在的设施也旧了,早餐也很差,停车场的人员服务也很次,下次不会选择住这里了,我觉得都没有如家舒服!","I stayed in the day before yesterday. I felt that I did n’t last well. I lived in the same room 2 years ago. The facilities are also old, the breakfast is also poor, the personnel services in the parking lot are also very time. I don’t choose to live here next time.Nothing is as comfortable at home!"
1,地理不错，大堂环境不错，房间设施齐全。不过早餐一般，不是很丰富。,"The geography is good, the lobby environment is good, and the room facilities are complete.But breakfast is generally rich."
0,1.老标间一股怪味，换了个同价位的单间，新装修的单间感觉较差，卫生间漏水，屋顶漏水；2.去房间的走廊过长；3.结账太慢，要等待。,"1. A strange smell of the old standard room, changed to a single room at the same price, the newly renovated single room feels poor, the bathroom leaks water, and the roof leaks; 2. The corridor in the room is too long; 3. The checkout is too slow, wait."
1,第一：chickin超慢，1：50进入，本来说3：00才可以入住，但到了3：00说房间还没有收拾出来，需要再等20分钟，请我们在大堂喝杯茶，真正入住时已经3：30分了，不明天每位客人11：00就退房了，怎么到3：00还没有打扫好呢？！第二：早餐价格不斐不说（218/成人；110/小孩），品种超少，本来就是想和卡通人物照个像，可那些卡通人物似乎只愿意和老外合影，对中国人，特别是内地的就是敷衍照几张，你如果还想照，它就根本不理你，朝它下一桌去了。第三：房间没有想象的好，也就是北京3-4星的样子，没有浴后乳，要自带呦，餐厅空调超冷，北方去的要带长袖衣裤，咱还真受不了,"First: Chickin is super slow, enter 1: 50, originally can only check in at 3:00, but at 3:00 said that the room has not been cleaned up. It takes another 20 minutes. Please drink a cup of tea in the lobby.It is already 3:30, and you will check out at 11:00 tomorrow. Why haven't you cleaned it at 3:00?IntersectionSecond: The price of breakfast is not good (218/adult; 110/child), the variety is very small, originally wanted to take a portrait with cartoon characters, but those cartoon characters seem to only be willing to take photos with foreigners, to the Chinese, especiallyThe mainland is a few perfunctory photos. If you still want to take it, it will ignore you at all and go towards it.Third: The room is not as good as expected, that is, the appearance of Beijing 3-4 stars. Without the milk after bathing, you have to bring your own. The restaurant air conditioner is super cold."
1,住过几次了，总体感觉还是不错的。,"I have lived several times, and the overall feels good."
1,酒店的位置很好，交通方便，开车比较好找，步行出去逛街也比较方便。房间设施一般，但是服务态度很好，一层还有一个24小时面馆，对于偶尔去旅游的人来说各方面还是很方便的。美中不足的是入住时候看到酒店前台标出的优惠价格跟携程预定的是一样的，希望携程能有更多优惠就最好了。,"The hotel is very good, convenient for transportation, it is easier to find to drive, and it is more convenient to go out and go shopping.The room facilities are average, but the service attitude is very good. There is a 24 -hour noodle restaurant on the first floor. It is still very convenient for those who occasionally travel.The disadvantage is that when you check in, you can see that the discount price marked at the front desk of the hotel is the same as that of Ctrip. I hope that Ctrip can have more discounts."
1,"威海合庆饭店的服务特别周到,特别人性化的服务.走南闯北住过很多酒店,但是从来没有1家象威海合庆饭店这样体贴周到的服务.","The service of Weihai Heqing Hotel is particularly thoughtful and specially humane service. Many hotels have been living in the north, but there is never a thoughtful service like Weihai Heqing Hotel."
1,我订的是标间B，房间在5楼，但是房间的浴室内是浴缸，并没有木桶。可能不是所有的房间都有木桶。从房间来说，只能说一般，还算干净而已，如果没有温泉的话，这个房价是绝对偏贵的。酒店客人的温泉票60元，但只能出入一次，有点不合理。温泉总共7个池子：室内6个：2个土耳其小鱼池，1个室内泳池，1个花瓣池，1个中药池，1个茶池；室外一个池。温泉设施明显比南京颐尚和武义要落后，但是温泉水质感觉不错，尤其是室外的那个。,"I booked a standard room B, the room is on the 5th floor, but the bathroom in the room is a bathtub without a barrel.Not all rooms have wooden barrels.From the room, it can only be said that it is generally clean. If there is no hot spring, this house price is absolutely expensive.The hotel guests' hot spring tickets are 60 yuan, but they can only enter and exit, which is a bit unreasonable.A total of 7 pools: 6 indoor: 2 Turkish small fish ponds, 1 indoor pool, 1 petal pool, 1 Chinese medicine pool, 1 tea pool; one outdoor pool.Hot spring facilities are obviously more backward than Nanjing Yishang and Wuyi, but the quality of hot spring water feels good, especially outdoor."
1,"其实只是一般,但前一天住到对面的长百合家欢假日垃圾酒店.对比下,就如同天堂与地狱的分别","In fact, it is just average, but the long lily family who lived on the opposite side the day before yesterday. In contrast, it is just like the difference between heaven and hell"
0,"房间又小又不开空调,然后边上施工吵得要死,电梯没两分钟你别想等到,看似一幢很高的楼,其实才7--15层是酒店!说好1411是情侣房,到后来结帐又说情侣房也算商务房的价格.(实际上从价格单上看,情侣房跟普标一个价,比商务房便宜的)宾馆反馈2008年5月8日：现在已经24小时开着空调,周围的施工已经完成了,客人不会再受影响.","The room is small and does not turn on the air conditioner, and then the construction is so noisy to die. You don't want to wait for the elevator for two minutes. It seems like a very high building. In fact, it is only 7--15 floors.Later, the checkout also said that the price of the couple's room is also the price of the commercial house. (In fact, from the price list, the couple's room and the general standard price are cheaper than the commercial house) feedback on May 8, 2008The air conditioner was turned on for 24 hours. The surrounding construction has been completed, and the guests will not be affected anymore."
1,最受不了的是宽带竟然是收费的，1小时12元！黑啊。。。就住了一晚，其它感觉还不错的。,"The most unbearable is that the broadband was charged, 12 yuan for 1 hour!Black.EssenceEssenceI stayed for a night, and the other felt good."
1,在郑州，长城饭店算是性价比很高的了，中西早餐很丰盛，房间也还不错，记得一定要订豪华标间，比普通标间只贵10元但房间大多了，不显得憋屈。在高楼层看郑州夜景的感觉很棒。不足之处：1。没有停车场，车都停在路边，车位少。2。淋浴的热水不好调节，稍动一点点水温就发生巨大变化，不容易精确控制温度。3。空调确实比较吵，有可能影响到休息。,"In Zhengzhou, the Great Wall Hotel is very cost -effective. The breakfast of China and the West is very abundant and the room is not bad. Remember to order a luxury standard room. It is only 10 yuan more expensive than the ordinary standard room but most of the rooms.It feels great to watch the night view of Zhengzhou on the high floors.Disadvantages: 1.There are no parking lots, the cars are parked on the side of the road, and the parking spaces are small.2.The hot water of the shower is not easy to adjust. A little bit of water temperature changes, it is not easy to accurately control the temperature.3.The air conditioner is indeed noisy, and it may affect rest."
1,原本对徐州好的酒店没有什么印象，按照携程的推荐，2次入住了该酒店，发现的确不错，环境优美，设施完善，服务周到，值得推荐。,"There was no impression of a good hotel in Xuzhou. According to the recommendation of Ctrip, I stayed in the hotel twice. It was found that it was really good, the environment was beautiful, the facilities were complete, the service was thoughtful, and it was worth recommending."
0,外部环境不错，但房间太旧了，晚上睡觉阳台门须用东西顶住。性价比不高。,"The external environment is good, but the room is too old. When you sleep at night, you need to hold things up with things.The price / performance ratio is not high."

1,也是朋友推荐来的这家酒店。本来说是要订3间房，后来看到有家庭式公寓房就订了一个普通的家庭房。来到酒店checkin的时候，告知要加床，前台建议住豪华家庭套房，两室一厅两卫，三张床，750元。于是就订了。,"It is also this hotel recommended by friends.Originally, I had to book 3 rooms. Later, I saw a family -style apartment and a ordinary family house was booked.When you come to the hotel checkin, he tells the bed. It is recommended to live in a luxury family suite at the front desk.So I booked it."
1,7月19日入住酒店总体感觉较好不足之处如下1.一号楼到二号楼的指示标志不明显，而且要走很远2.服务人员似乎不知道什么是主动见面打招呼，这点比起海景花园酒店要差的远。我在酒店大厅、走廊、院子里，见到酒店各个岗位的服务人员，大部分都不知道应该主动和客人打招呼问好,"It is as follows as the maintenance of the hotel on July 19 as follows 1. The indication sign from Building No. 1 to Building No. 2 is not obvious, and it is far away. 2. The service staff does not seem to know what is actively meeting and say hello.The Sea View Garden Hotel is far away.In the hotel lobby, corridor, yard, I see the service staff of the hotels in the hotel."
1,我5月30日入住，6月1日退房，但比较离谱的是当我5月31日外出办事时，回来竟发现房间已经checkout，当时我极其郁闷，酒店也很纳闷，幸好房间我没有放任何私人物品。还好，酒店的应急方案不错，并送了一份水果致歉，最好告诉我说是新来员工摆乌龙，这个理由有点勉强。,"I stayed on May 30 and checked out on June 1, but the more outrageous thing was that when I went to work on May 31, I came back and found that the room had checkout.Put any private items.Fortunately, the hotel's emergency plan is good, and a fruit is given an apology. It is best to tell me that it is a new employee to set up oolong. This reason is a bit reluctant."
1,大堂较小，房间不错，离地铁四号线非常近，交通比较方便。,"The lobby is smaller, the room is good, it is very close to Metro Line 4, and the traffic is more convenient."
1,在湛江想要享受好的环境的话，别无二选，就是这里了，硬件(设施)和软件(服务)都是让人十分满意。走去室外游泳池的时候，刚一推门服务员就从座位上站起来了，笑着打招呼，虽说最终自己没去游，但看着游泳池也很干净，环境让人很舒服。最不好的地方是收银，在湛江住别的酒店check-out时都得等查房，看有没有消费他们的酒水，我回答没有还不算数，非得等housekeeping一样一样地点过数才行，我的信用、自尊还有我的信用卡预授权都没用。本以为这里五星级酒店不会那样，哪知道住客说的话在这里还是不被相信。另外，走的时候赶早班机，五点多下去退房结帐，发现前台小妹妹偷偷在打瞌睡......呵呵,"If you want to enjoy a good environment in Zhanjiang, there is no choice, that is, here, hardware (facilities) and software (service) are very satisfactory.When walking out of the outdoor swimming pool, the waiter who pushed the door stood up from the seat and said hello with a smile. Although he did not go swimming in the end, it was very clean to watch the swimming pool, and the environment was very comfortable.The worst thing is the cashier. When you stay in other hotels in Zhanjiang, you have to wait for the housing to see if you consume their drinks. I answered that it is not countless. You have to wait for the Housekeeping to be too good.My credit, self -esteem, and my credit card pre -authorization are useless.I thought that the five -star hotels would not be like that, how can I know what the guests say are still not believed here.In addition, when you leave, you can rush the morning plane, check out at five o'clock, and check out the checkout at the front desk."
1,一般设施不错，其他一般早餐也不错,"The general facilities are good, and other general breakfast is also good"
1,12日入住，前台服务尚可，标准间大床房，房间空间不错，有外伸式阳台，室内布置比较大方。卫生间有温泉水和自来水两路供水。但缺点是：1.卫生间配置缺少揩手小方巾、洗发精沐浴液装置均不好用；2.房间宽带必须申请才能开通；3.早餐实在让人无法接受，付费15元的早餐，除了茶叶蛋“保证供应”外，东西品种和数量少的可怜：仅有小馒头和糖包，凉面。饮料有甜牛奶、橙汁。宾馆反馈2008年6月17日：首先感谢您选择洋桥大厦，关于您提出的建议我们会在今后的工作中加以改进，对于早餐我们的品种大约15种左右。我们的早餐时间是早6：30-9：00钟结束，并希望您的理解。再次感谢您选择北京洋桥大厦。,"Checking on the 12th, the front desk service is acceptable, the standard room is large, the room space is good, there is an extension balcony, and the interior layout is relatively generous.The bathroom has hot spring water and tap water.But the disadvantage is: 1. The bathroom configuration lacks a small square scarf and a shampoo shower solution device; 2. The room broadband must be applied to open; 3. Breakfast is really unacceptable.In addition to the ""guarantee supply"" of tea eggs, there is a small number of east -west varieties and quantities: only small buns and sugar bags, cold noodles.The drinks include sweet milk and orange juice.Hotel feedback on June 17, 2008: First of all, thank you for choosing Yangqiao Building. The suggestions you put forward will be improved in the future work. About 15 kinds of breakfast varieties.Our breakfast is ended at 6: 30-9: 00 minutes, and I hope your understanding.Thank you again for choosing Beijing Yangqiao Building."
1,位于鹅岭公园边，比起市中心的酒店安静很多，重庆都是山路，所以汽车起步上坡噪音很大，这里会好很多，尤其是靠公园的一面，装修不错，房间也挺大的，由美国豪生集团管理酒店，所以服务总的来说还是满意的，最值得一提的是4楼早餐厅，外面一半是开放的，直接对着公园，只有一门之隔，喜欢接近自然的朋友一定很喜欢的，虽然种类不多，但是环境一流，住了5天，看到很多结婚的生日宴会的，看来他们也是冲着来的，有些遗憾的是空调似乎不太足，我是很喜欢低温的，也需一般客人足够了，还有花洒似乎太花哨点，有两层可以出水，但是也许管道太长，调节水温很不敏感，必须要在水流边等很长时间才有变化交通方不方便看你自己，打的到大坪，然后做轻轨到朝天门最方便，打的也不贵15块钱而已。总的来说值得推荐,"It is located by the Yeling Park. It is much quieter than the hotel in the city center. Chongqing is a mountain road, so the car starts up and uphill. It will be much better here, especially the side of the park. The decoration is good and the room is quite large.The hotel is managed by the United States Hao Sheng Group, so the service is generally satisfied. The most worth mentioning is the 4th floor breakfast. Half of the outside is open and directly faces the park.Friends must like it very much. Although there are not many types, but the environment is first -rate, I lived for 5 days, and I saw a lot of wedding birthday banquets. It seems that they are also coming. Some regrets that the air conditioner seems to be not enough.I really like low temperature, and the general guests are enough, and the shower seems to be too sloppy. There are two floors to get out of the water, but maybe the pipeline is too long. It is not sensitive to adjust the water temperature.The change of traffic is inconvenient to look at yourself. It is most convenient to get to Daping, and then do light rails to Chaotianmen, and it is not expensive for 15 yuan.Generally speaking, it is worth recommending"
1,空调声音太大了。。。早餐可以去南翔包子吃（出门左走100米）。,The sound of air conditioners is too loud.EssenceEssenceBreakfast can go to Nanxiang buns to eat (go out to go to the left 100 meters).
1,表扬：餐厅，中餐做得很好，价钱也不贵，份量也不错，早餐也不错。和在天柱山大门口的农家菜比环境、质量好很多，而价钱也不贵，推荐。批评：中医推拿，不专业，可能还不如我的水平呢。另，洗衣服务虽然有，但加急还是比较慢。我出去漂流打水涨全身湿透，到酒店指望赶紧弄干，结果n个小时也没搞定。,"Commendation: restaurant, Chinese food is well done, the price is not expensive, the portion is good, and the breakfast is good.And the farm food at the gate of Tianzhu Mountain is much better than the environment and quality, and the price is not expensive. It is recommended.Criticism: Chinese medicine massage, unprofessional, may not be as good as my level.In addition, although there are laundry services, it is relatively slow.I went out and drifted and drifted. I was soaked in the whole body. I went to the hotel to get dry. As a result, I did not get it for N hours a hour."
1,我带家人住过一次，印象非常好，是度假好地方，晚餐星期一到五买三送一，很划算。我八月又准备去住了。,I have taken my family once and I have a very good impression. It is a good place for vacation. It is very cost -effective to buy three get one free on Monday to Friday.I was going to live in August.
0,夜景不错，房间不错，早餐很不错，离海边和商业区有点距离，服务满意度也有些距离。,"The night scene is good, the room is good, the breakfast is very good, there is a little distance from the seaside and the commercial area, and the service satisfaction is also a little bit distance."
1,"因为工作关系,每个月都会去住.在金华市区400左右是最好的选择.","Because of the work relationship, it will live every month. It is the best choice in about 400 in Jinhua City."
1,酒店离徽杭高速出口很近，很容易找到的，离黄山市中心也不远的,"The hotel is very close to Huihang High -speed exports, it is easy to find, and it is not far from the center of Huangshan City."
1,该酒店位置很好，本次入住2002房间，对面就是大海，很漂亮。酒店的前台服务很到位。因要搭晚上9点的船票离开威海，就把行李存放在前台，服务员很热情。赞一个！携程的性价比不是很高，300元的标间还不含早，不过有携程送的水果，还好啦，呵呵,"The hotel location is very good. This time, staying in Room 2002, the opposite is the sea, which is very beautiful.The hotel's front desk service is in place.If you want to leave Weihai at 9 o'clock in the evening, you will store your luggage on the front desk, and the waiter is very enthusiastic.give it a like!Ctrip's cost performance is not very high. The 300 yuan standard room is not early, but there are fruits sent by Ctrip."
0,房间整洁，空间狭小，椅子和床之间太近了，坐在桌前不舒服，电视为吊挂式，只能躺在床上看，而且必须抬着头，建议换成壁挂式小液晶。,"The room is tidy, the space is small, the chair and the bed are too close. Sitting at the table is not comfortable. The TV is a hanging type. You can only lie on the bed and watch it. It must be raised. It is recommended to replace it with a wall -hanging small liquid crystal."
1,在北京属于比较实在的酒店，环境、房间、服务都还不错，网速稍嫌慢些，早餐经常要零点，比较慢，不太方便。行政标准间隔音效果极差，标准间隔音效果要好得多。,"It is a relatively solid hotel in Beijing. The environment, rooms, and services are not bad. The speed of the network is slightly slower. Breakfast is often zero. It is slower and not convenient.Administrative standards have poor sound insulation effects, and the standard sound insulation effect is much better."
1,这个酒店给我的感觉非常好，服务可以和5星级酒店媲美了！满意！宾馆反馈2008年8月1日：感谢您对酒店的支持，宾客至上是我们的服务理念，我们会继续努力的，期待您的再次光临。,"This hotel feels very good, and the service can be comparable to 5 -star hotels!satisfy!Hotel feedback on August 1, 2008: Thank you for your support to the hotel. Guests first are our service concept. We will continue to work hard and look forward to your visit again."
1,"这次订的是豪华商务房,干净,设施也齐全,免费宽带可以使用.感觉是小一号的索菲特.很不错.唯一不足的是电视的频道非常少,国内三星级酒店都有的凤凰卫视居然没有.但是对于商务人士来说还是可以的了.交通也非常方便,地铁,出租车等非常方便.由于没有和酒店的服务人员打交道,所以服务方面就不评分了.建议前台多增加人手,在办理CHECKIN和CHECKOUT的时候都是一个工作人员,时间太长乐.宾馆反馈2008年7月25日：前台人员少确实是暂时的问题，我们重新调整了班次时间，尽量让您满意。给您带来不便敬请谅解。","This time it is a luxurious business house, clean, complete facilities, free broadband can be used. It feels like Sophiete of the No. 1. It is very good. The only disadvantage is that there are very few TV channels.The Phoenix Satellite TV does not have it. But it is still possible for business people. Transportation is also very convenient. It is very convenient for subways, taxis, etc. Because they do not deal with the hotel service staff, the service is not scored. It is recommended that the front desk is more.Increased manpower, when applying for Checkin and Checkout, they are both staff members. Time is too long. Hotel feedback on July 25, 2008: The small front desk staff is indeed a temporary problem. We have adjusted the class time and try to satisfy you.sorry for the incovenience."
0,帮客户订的，一开始还非常担心，因为地段不是很好，不过最终还是比较满意的，没有什么特别不好的地方，下次还是不追求特价房了，换莫泰好点的地段和房间。,"It was very worried at first, because the location was not very good, but in the end, it was relatively satisfactory. There was nothing particularly bad. I still do n’t pursue a special room next time."
1,２００１年来福州就住在这里，这次感觉房间就了点，温泉水还是有的．总的来说很满意．早餐简单了些．,"Fuzhou lived here in 2001. This time I feel that the room is a bit, and there are still hot spring water.Generally speaking, very satisfied.Breakfast is simpler."
1,去香港的主要原因就是为了购物，住这家酒店令我最满意的就它的地理位置非常的方便（尤其是带宝宝旅游的妈妈），你不会因为宝宝太小走不了多少路而困惑，因为这家酒店就位于香港最繁华的海港城中，不管是硬件还是软件绝对符合四星的标准，尤其是床非常大很舒服。出了酒店的门就是令郎满目各种品牌的商品，会让你有足不出户的感觉，因为你就住在商场里，里面吃饭购物非常方便。如果你的宝宝累了或者买的东西太多你可以马上就回到酒店，稍作休息，真的非常方便！！,"The main reason for going to Hong Kong is to shop. Living in this hotel makes me most satisfied with its geographical location (especially mothers with baby traveling). You will not be confused because your baby can't go too much.Because this hotel is located in the most prosperous seaport city in Hong Kong, whether it is hardware or software, it is absolutely in line with the standards of the four -star, especially the bed is very large and comfortable.The door of the hotel is the products of all kinds of brands that make Lang, which will make you feel that you do n’t go out of the house, because you live in the mall, which is very convenient to eat and shop inside.If your baby is tired or you buy too much, you can return to the hotel immediately. It is really convenient to rest a little!Intersection"
0,地下车库几乎没有灯，一地泥汤，下车时踩了一脚泥水。所谓海景房看不到海不说，临界巨吵，半夜被街上小贩、拖拉机吵醒再也无法入睡。有骚扰电话，宽带不能上网。没有浴缸，没有浴帽，没有放拖鞋。前台小姐居然拿着电话与男友聊情话而把客人晾一边，真是仅见观瞻。建议携程取消与这家的合作。,"There are almost no lights in the underground garage, and the mud soup is one place. When I got off the car, I stepped on the mud.The so -called sea -view room can't see the sea, and the critical quarrel is huge. In the middle of the night, he was woken up by hawkers and tractors on the street and could no longer fall asleep.There are harassment calls, and broadband cannot access the Internet.There are no bathtubs, no shower caps, no slippers.The lady in the front desk actually took the phone to talk to her boyfriend and put the guests aside.It is recommended to cancel cooperation with this one."
1,环境，服务都不错，但设施确实有点成旧，房间是以前疗养院改造过来，卫生间走水有点不畅，请对房间内设施要求比较高的朋友别报太大希望，但幸运的是，住的后面几天遇见整个旧楼这块被奥运会火炬传递工作组的包下来了，酒店把我们免费升级到贵宾楼，那边真的很不错。,"The environment and services are good, but the facilities are indeed a bit old. The room was reconstructed in the past. The bathroom was a bit unpleasant. Please do not report it for friends with higher facilities in the room.In the next few days, I met the entire old building. The torch transfer working group was packed by the Olympic torch. The hotel upgraded us to the VIP building for free. It was really good."
0,"房间太旧,太吵.洗手间没有热水,建议携程取消和其合作.补充点评2007年11月11日：服务态度恶劣,言语不是太冲就是冷冰冰的,房间设施陈旧.卫生间小.","The room is too old and too noisy. There is no hot water in the bathroom. It is recommended to cancel and cooperate with them. Supplementary reviews November 11, 2007: The service attitude is bad, the words are either too rushing or cold, and the room facilities are old. The bathroom is small."
0,"这个是我住国全国最差的所谓四星标准建的宾馆.房间小的可怜,可以说让人无法转身.看上去最多也只有三星级.服务员结帐速度超慢,我等侯了半小时,最后还问了一句话,超过了4分钟(等到我的时候时12:04)是不是要加收半天的房费.希望携程不要把这种酒店再列为推荐酒店.说句时候,房间的情况和总总台那里的汇报一下","This is the most so -called four -star standard in the country in the country. The small room is poor. It can be said that people can't turn around. It looks like a three -star level. The waiter's checkout speed is very slow.In the hour, I finally asked a word, for more than 4 minutes (waiting for me at 12:04) Is it necessary to charge a half -day room fee. I hope Ctrip will not list this hotel as a recommended hotel.The situation of the room and the report on the head office"
1,"这次我们订的海景房,入住比上次入住时的环境稍好一些,地理位置也是靠近海,比较好找.可惜的是到了晚上热水没有了,都是凉水.不知是锅炉太小了还是其他什么原因?等到第二天早上开热水时,一下子又把人烫得要死.变化太大了吧!还有就是娱乐项目的价格偏高了一些.","This time we ordered the sea -view room, the environment was better than the environment at the time of the last time, and the geographical location was close to the sea. It was better to find it. Unfortunately, the hot water was gone at night.Or what's the other reason? When the hot water is turned on the next morning, it will be hot again at once. The change is too great! And the price of the entertainment project is a bit higher."
1,"典型的客家山水度假地，就如山庄形象代表--餐厅服务员阿婷身上透谢着客家人和物的自信,开朗，纯真,朴实和美丽。元旦两夜三日三次登上越王山顶，流连忘返，感受超值。建议游客登山带上手袜，山庄在山径多提示不要丢杂物垃圾和注意钢丝头处的安全保护.","The typical Hakka landscape vacation is just like the image representative of the villa-restaurant waiter A Ting thanked the Hakka people and the self-confidence, cheerfulness, innocence, simplicity and beauty.On the two nights of New Year's Day, I boarded the top of the Yue Wangshan three times, lingering and forgetting to feel value.It is recommended that tourists climbing up socks.

1,携程工作人员按照我的要求，给我介绍了这家酒店，我抱着试试看的心情，去住了一次，总体感觉还是非常不错的。我是一个非常注重干净整洁的一个人，也很在意细节，所以，住酒店我一直都有点担心，迫于工作性质，必须经常在外出差。很多我之前住过的酒店都不太理想，但是这家酒店还真是对胃口了。房间非常明亮大气，非常干净，我从服务员口中得知，这家酒店已经开了2年多了，但是床单、被套、毛巾都是崭新的，床非常大，柔软，有家的感觉。晚上开好夜床，床头柜上还放有糖果，很细致的服务。房间给人的感觉非常放松，空气也非常清新。房间里上网免费，很方便。入住时还送了一张免费的咖啡券，虽然没去喝，但是还是很高兴，能享受到如此周到的服务。房间里面的电视频道非常多，好多国家的台都有。早上退房前，我给前台打了电话，说需要退房，两分钟后，礼宾部的男孩子就到我的房间了，我非常吃惊。跟这位员工聊了几句，他是接到前台通知来帮我拿行李的。他说，只要他们不忙，会在第一时间赶到需要帮助的房间，帮助客人，听得我很感动。原来他们以为我打电话到前台是要寻求帮助的，想得太周到了。在办离店手续的时候，他们已经自动帮我叫好了出租车，可能在之前的谈话中，礼宾部的员工已经知道我要去机场了，太人性化了！我到机场也只花了18元钱，离机场真的很近，很方便的。不会耽误航班。这个酒店很符合我的要求，服务很人性化，我以后每次来上海，都要住这个酒店。,"According to my requirements, Ctrip staff introduced me to this hotel. I went to live with the mood of trying and seeing it. The overall feeling was very good.I am a person who pays great attention to cleanliness and cares about details. Therefore, I have always been a little worried about living in the hotel. I have to go out to go out often.Many hotels I have lived before are not ideal, but this hotel is really appetizing.The room was very bright and very clean. I learned from the waiter's mouth that the hotel has been opened for more than 2 years, but the sheets, quilts, and towels are brand new. The beds are very large, soft, and they feel at home.Open the night bed at night, and there are candy on the bedside table, which is very detailed.The room feels very relaxed and the air is very fresh.Free Internet access in the room, very convenient.I also gave a free coffee coupon during the check -in. Although I didn't drink, I was still very happy to enjoy such a thoughtful service.There are many TV channels in the room, and there are many countries.Before checking out in the morning, I called the front desk and said that I needed to check out. Two minutes later, the boys of the Libin department arrived in my room. I was very surprised.I talked with this employee a few words, he received a notice from the front desk to help me get my luggage.He said that as long as they are not busy, they will rush to the room that needs help in the first time to help guests, and I can hear me very moved.It turned out that they thought that I had to ask for help when I called the front desk, and I thought it was too thoughtful.During the procedures for the departure store, they have automatically applauded the taxi for me. In the previous conversation, the employees of the Libin Department already knew that I was going to the airport, which was too user -friendly!I only spent 18 yuan at the airport, which is really close to the airport and very convenient.Will not delay flights.This hotel meets my requirements and the service is very humane. Every time I come to Shanghai in the future, I will live in this hotel."
1,"总的来说还是不错的,但服务的态度和水准有待进一步提高","In general, it is still good, but the attitude and level of service need to be further improved"
0,"这是我住过最烂的酒店了,比招待所还差,外观看起来还好,一进去吓一跳,箱子只能往床下放!热水器还要自己烧水,都不是自动的!哎,厕所也看起来恐怖!反正就是差,差,差!幸亏只定了一天,连澡都没洗,第2天一大早就换酒店了!","This is the worst hotel I have lived. It is worse than the guest house. The appearance looks good. As soon as I go in, the box can only be left under the bed! The water heater is not automatic! Hey, the toilet, the toilet, the toilet,It also looks scary! Anyway, it is bad, bad, bad! Fortunately, it was only set for a day, not even washed, and changed the hotel early on the second day!"
0,预订是携程小姐推荐的，怎么说，一个字，烂，两个字，真烂，三个字，实在烂。典型的政府国营单位的痕迹，根本不懂什么叫服务，房间既小又破，三星都勉强。花400多买了瓶红酒，馊的！,"Booking is recommended by Miss Ctrip. How to say, one word, rotten, two words, really bad, three words, really bad.The traces of a typical government -state -owned unit do not understand what services are. The rooms are small and broken, and Samsung is barely.I bought more than 400 bottle of red wine, ah!"
1,房间一般，隔音感觉不是很好，地理位置不错，就在江边，靠江的房间开穿远眺就能看见大佛。服务态度餐厅的比前台好很多，早餐品种少了点。,"In the room, the sound insulation feels not very good, and the geographical location is good. Just by the river, you can see the big Buddha when you open the room in the river.The service attitude restaurant is much better than the front desk, and there are fewer breakfast."
1,"政府酒店感觉很气派,而且很干净,整个酒店的房间布局也很整齐.5月份入住的,由于第一天房间不能上网,和前台协调又换了一间可以上网的,还帮忙调试了笔记本,服务很周到.正好住的两天都有人结婚,感觉酒店一楼的宴会厅很适合婚礼","The government hotel feels very elegant and clean, and the room layout of the entire hotel is also neat. It was stayed in in May. Because the room could not access the Internet on the first day, I replaced the Internet with the front desk to help debug the notebook.The service is very thoughtful. There are people who have been married for two days. I feel that the banquet hall on the first floor of the hotel is very suitable for weddings."
1,宾馆服务非常好，环境也很好，但在宾馆吃饭太贵了，地角很偏，交通很不方便。,"The hotel service is very good and the environment is also very good, but eating at the hotel is too expensive, the corners are very biased, and the traffic is inconvenient."
1,"酒店地理条件还算优越,出门就是景点,不过到处弥漫着消毒水的味道,心情实在是好不到哪里去...价格也太贵了点...","The geographical conditions of the hotel are pretty superior. When you go out, it is an attraction, but the taste of disinfection water is filled everywhere."
1,"价格在这个地段属于适中,附近有早餐店,小饭店,比较方便,无早也无所",The price is moderate in this area. There are breakfast restaurants and small restaurants nearby. It is more convenient.
0,原来准备住四天，后来住了两天换成庐山宾馆。宾馆感觉：缺点：房间潮湿，装修陈旧特别是洗手间，房门几乎（门框对门框）对着公用卫生间，臭！隔音很差，偏僻、交通不便。优点：免费宽带上网值得一提的是餐厅：价格较贵，但态度不错，有天晚上正在关灯的时候我们进去的，还是为我们做了菜，虽然品种不多拉。和庐山宾馆比较一下逍夏宾馆庐山宾馆位置偏僻，上街走路30-40分近街，上街10分钟交通几乎没有的士经过斜对面是美庐，随时有车周边环境较好很好房间设施一般，较旧，乳胶漆有剥脱较新，墙纸干净卫生间很旧，感觉脏新，干净宾馆环境一般，大堂地砖一般，大堂地毯隔音情况极差很好宽带上网有小标没有，大标部分有,"It turned out to live for four days, and later stayed for two days and replaced it with Lushan Hotel.Hotel feel: Disadvantages: Wet in the room, old decoration, especially toilets, the door of the room is almost (door frame to the door frame) facing the public bathroom, smelly!The sound insulation is poor, remote and inconvenient.Advantages: Free broadband online is worth mentioning that the restaurant: the price is more expensive, but the attitude is good. When we are turning in the lights at night, we still make food for us, although the variety is not much.Compared with Lushan Hotel, Lushan Hotel Lushan Hotel is remote, and walking on the street 30-40 points is near the street. There is almost no taxi on the street for 10 minutes.Generally, older, latex paint is more refreshing, the wallpaper is clean and the bathroom is very old, it feels dirty, clean in the hotel environment, lobby ground tiles, lobby carpet sound insulation is very bad."
1,房间设施老旧，但还算整洁。周边有很多商场，方便购物。我把买的东东放回房间，继续Shopping，无非是过个人行天桥而已。交通便利。早餐实在是伐善可陈……,"The room facilities are old, but it is still clean.There are many shopping malls around it for convenient shopping.I put the buying Dongdong back to the room and continuing to goPeping. It was nothing more than a personal flyover.Convenient transportation.Breakfast is really good and good ..."
1,"硬件不错,商务酒店里面算是有特色的了。服务中等，前台不错，但房间服务一般般。价格比较贵，不过行政间大抵都这样子。位置有点偏不太好找，出租汽车司机有些找不到，说是万象城附近，但要绕进去","The hardware is good, and the business hotel is distinctive.The service is medium, the front desk is good, but the room service is general.The price is more expensive, but the administrative is probably like this.The location is a bit not easy to find. Some taxi drivers can't find it. It is said that it is near Vientiane City, but I have to go in"
0,是以前的工人宿舍改造的，旁边施工很吵。酒店的设施也不是很好。,"It was transformed by the previous workers' dormitory, and the construction was noisy.The hotel's facilities are not very good."
1,挺不错的酒店。就是太难找了！！我的司机转啊转啊。。看到了都找不到入口。标示不明显，建议找当地出租可能会好一点。健身房设备有限。,"Very good hotel.It's too difficult to find!IntersectionMy driver turns.EssenceI can't find the entrance when I see it.The label is not obvious, it is recommended to find a local rental.Gym equipment is limited."
1,"虽身处繁华地区,但房价非常经济.卫生.服务都不错,中央空调.24小时热水.如果下次来一定住此,真好!!!!!!!!!!!","Although they are in bustling areas, house prices are very economical. Sanitary. Service is good, central air conditioning. 24 hours hot water. If you come here next time, it will be good !!!!!!!!!!!"
1,房间设施装修都不错，服务到位，餐厅早餐还够的上标准，但发现餐具清洗的有些问题。我们一家三口连续住了三天，每天都发现餐盘和咖啡杯上有污迹，算是美中不足的一点缺憾吧。,"The room facilities are well decorated, the service is in place, and the restaurant breakfast is enough to be standard, but it is found that there are some problems in the cleaning of tableware.The family of three we lived in three consecutive days, and every day we found that there were stains on the dishes and coffee cups."
1,这已经是我第二次入住该酒店了。酒店是在市中心，没想到这次入住酒店有了泊车服务，让人感觉停车很方便。办理入住登记时，前台小姐也礼貌热情。我住的客房是标准B，房间不错，退房结帐时行李员主动帮我提着行李，前台服务员操作快捷。总的来说，这家酒店很不错，听服务员介绍，该酒店还有更好房间，好象是贵宾楼的，下次我决定住住看那种房间。,"This is the second time I have been in the hotel.The hotel is in the center of the city. I did not expect that there was a parking service in the hotel this time, which made people feel convenient to park.When checking in registration, the front desk lady is also polite and enthusiastic.The room I live in is a standard B, the room is good. When checking out and checkout, the lugglers actively help me carry my luggage. The front desk waiter operates quickly.In general, this hotel is very good. Listening to the waiter introduced that the hotel still has better rooms, as if it is from a VIP building. Next time I decided to live in the room."
1,房间很好，设施也很新，总的来说还是很满意的。周围的很方便，楼下隔壁都有商场。,"The room is very good, the facilities are also very new, and it is still very satisfactory in general.The surroundings are very convenient, there are shopping malls next door downstairs."
1,交通比较便，设施比较新，房间比较小，早餐比较乱。,"The transportation is relatively convenient, the facilities are relatively new, the room is relatively small, and the breakfast is more chaotic."
1,大体感觉不错，环境也还好，离海边不远，只是附近没有什么超市，小卖部，餐馆一类的，不很繁华。离老龙头挺近的，走着就能到。,"It feels good, the environment is also good, not far from the beach, but there are no supermarkets nearby, small sales, restaurants, etc., are not very prosperous.It's close to the old faucet, and you can arrive."
1,"地处市中心,价格有竞争力,服务可以.规模不太大,前段时间正在重新装修.总体影响不错,值得一住.","Located in the center of the city, the price is competitive, the service can. The scale is not too large. It is renovating a while ago. The overall impact is good, it is worth living."
1,我入住的是该酒店的中式大床房，房间环境和服务质量都不错，就是楼层低点，在4楼（整个酒店也就5层楼高），整体不错，就是送的早餐不是自助餐，而是2楼酒楼的10元餐卷，对于一个人的话很不方便。,"It is a 10 yuan meal roll on the restaurant on the second floor, which is inconvenient for a person."
1,非常不错的一家酒店，硬件软件都是一流的。三个餐厅也都非常不错。咖啡厅的蛋糕到了晚上半价。行李生非常热情。并帮助捆绑临时增加的行李（工作用纸箱）并免费提供胶带等。非常感谢。,"A very good hotel, hardware and software are first -class.The three restaurants are also very good.Cafe cake is half price in the evening.Luggage is very enthusiastic.And help bundle the temporary increase of luggage (working carton) and provide tape for free.Thank you so much."
1,"我入住的时间是9月7日到9月10日,528元一天携程价，这是个标准三星级酒店，和照片里的大堂环境相去甚远，没有给我两眼一亮的感觉，但它送双早餐的，地理位置不错，靠近海边和音乐广场，走到五四广场也就几分钟的事，房间的设施很普通，最后一天马桶坏了，第一天床单没有换过，掀开都是毛发，通知大堂后立刻来换了，某些服务生微笑服务的痕迹太过明显，不太自然，早餐还可以，和528一天的消费来讲，我觉得性价比不是很高,毕竟不是海景房。","I stayed from September 7th to September 10th, 528 yuan a day to carry the price. This is a standard Samsung hotel. It is far from the lobby environment in the photo.It gives a double breakfast. The geographical location is good. It is close to the seaside and music square. It is only a few minutes to walk to the May 4th Plaza. The facilities in the room are very ordinary. On the last day, the toilet is broken.They are all hair. After notifying the lobby, they came to change immediately. The traces of some waiters' smile services were too obvious. It was not natural. Breakfast was okay. In terms of 528 days of consumption, I think the price / performance ratio is not very high. After all, it is not a sea view.house."
1,"日照海纳君豪酒店服务细致,环境更是一流,面对帆船基地,碧海蓝天!!","Rizhao Haina Junhao Hotel has meticulous services and the environment is even more first. Facing the sailing base, the blue sea and blue sky !!"
1,"商务间新装修很乾净,就是房间很小,从床到书桌只有窄小的空隙,如果房间都能像实景图那样大小就更好了。","The new decoration of the business room is very clean, that is, the room is very small. There is only a narrow gap from bed to desks. If the room can be as small as the real scene, it will be better."
0,"这家酒店绝对没有四星级,而且房间的隔音太差,马路上的车声\楼上的乱七八糟的声音,硬是让我一晚上没睡着.强烈建议携程取消这家.大堂餐厅承包给了个人，所以自助早餐只能在大堂咖啡厅内，设施不完善，品种也少。强烈建议携程取消该酒店的推荐。","This hotel is absolutely no four -star level, and the sound insulation of the room is too bad. The messy sound of the car on the road \ upstairs makes me not fall asleep all night. It is strongly recommended that Ctrip to cancel the house.Personally, the buffet breakfast can only be in the lobby cafes. The facilities are not complete and there are few varieties.It is strongly recommended to cancel the recommendation of the hotel."
1,我是12月去的，环境很好，豪华的海景房，从阳台望出去就是海月广场，晚上的景色更美，广场上很热闹。还有特产超市，买东西也很方面。,"I went to December. The environment is very good. The luxurious sea view room is the sea moon square when I look out from the balcony. The scenery at night is more beautiful and the square is very lively.There are also specialty supermarkets, and they are also buying things."
1,房间较为宽敞，服务一般，退房较慢，早餐尚可，但二楼中餐厅贵的离谱了，靠近01、02的房间经常会受到下面打保龄球的震动声，像是打雷一样。但总得来说在天津此价位带早餐及宽带的酒店，此酒店算是物美价廉了。此酒店可以推荐住。,"The rooms are relatively spacious, the service is average, the check -up is relatively slow, and the breakfast is acceptable, but the Chinese restaurant on the second floor is expensive. The rooms near the 01 and 02 are often shocked by the bumper ball below, like thunder.But in all, there must be a hotel with breakfast and broadband at this price in Tianjin. This hotel is cheap.This hotel can be recommended."
0,5月初入住这家酒店，只可以用2个字形容“糟糕”，是我见过的最差的5星级，晚上1楼的disco舞厅一直会营业到凌晨2：30，声音吵杂，还有重音鼓点让住在18楼的客人也无法入睡，不可想象低楼层的客人们怎么忍受这种5星级的待遇!早餐简陋，这个也是我第一次给住过的酒店点评，实在是住得太窝囊了！如果有0分得选项，我会毫不犹豫选0分,"Staying in this hotel in early May, I can only describe ""bad"" in 2 words. It is the worst 5 star I have ever seen. The DISCO Ballroom on the first floor I have been opened will be opened until 2:30 in the morning. The sound is noisy.There are intertwined drums that make guests living on the 18th floor unable to fall asleep. I can't imagine how the low -floor guests can endure this 5 -star treatment! Breakfast is simple. This is also the first time I have lived in a hotel comment.It's too nest!If there are 0 points options, I will not hesitate to choose 0 points"
1,地理位置很好，就在DFS的楼上，晚上比其他专卖店关门晚，可以最后逛到尽兴。离海港城也很近，2-3分钟步行。酒店设施和服务都很好，房间内还备有多用转接头，几乎什么插头都可以转接，走的时候忘记找他们买一个，真的很方便，以后去哪个国家都可以用它。服务人员很亲切。房间不算太大，两张床间的距离就只有一条缝，不过其他硬件设施都不错，有液晶电视，卫生间有点像三亚喜来登酒店的样子，就是卫生间有个窗户对这房间，可以一边泡澡一边看房间的电视。新装修的房间。支持，下次还住。,"The geographical location is very good, just upstairs in DFS. It is later than other specialty stores in the evening.It is also very close to Harbor City, walking for 2-3 minutes.The hotel facilities and services are very good. There are many rotary connections in the room. Almost any plugs can be transferred. Forgot to find them to buy one when walking. It is really convenient. In any country, you can use it.The service staff is very kind.The room is not too big. There is only one slit in the two beds, but other hardware facilities are good. There are LCD TVs. The bathroom is a bit like the Sheraton Hotel in Sanya. There is a window in the bathroom.Watching the room in the room.Newly renovated room.Support, live next time."
1,酒店位置很好，中山陵里面，梅花山旁边，走过去很近。但是房价和价格不成正比，大堂很豪华但是冷清；528的房间很干净，服务也不错，只是设施陈旧了点，比如马桶盖居然是看起来旧旧的塑料盖，房间里面的椅子也很旧了。若价格降到300到350还差不多。,"The hotel location is very good. In the Zhongshan Mausoleum, the Meihua Mountain is close to it.However, house prices are not proportional to the price. The lobby is luxurious but deserted; the room of 528 is clean and the service is good, but the facilities are older. For example, the toilet lid is actually the old plastic cover, and the chair in the room is also very old.EssenceIf the price drops to 300 to 350, it is almost the same."
1,呵呵……套间反倒没有连上宽带……不过房间（普通套间）物有所值，我比较满意。只是遇到了一个会议，会议退房搞的大厅极为混乱，我不认为与天鹅湖有关，应该属于会议组织者重大失误！正在考虑春节订房……补充点评2007年1月13日：哦！对这里的餐饮不好评说。我希望其他住客点评！,"Hehe ... The suite is not connected to the broadband ... but the room (ordinary suite) is worth it, I am more satisfied.I just met a meeting. The lobby of the meeting was extremely chaotic. I don't think it is related to Swan Lake. It should belong to the conference organizer and make major mistakes!Considering the Spring Festival reservation ... Supplementary review January 13, 2007: Oh!Don't praise the catering here.I hope other guests comment!"
0,缺点：房间过于狭小，毛巾更换不勤，而且毛巾有异味儿，不太干净，没有窗户造成房间内霉味儿很浓，没有矿泉水装置，前台服务员态度极其一般，宽带速度太慢。,"Disadvantages: The room is too narrow, the towel is not diligent, and the towels are odor and are not clean. There is no mold in the room. There is no mineral water installation. The front desk waiter is extremely average, and the broadband speed is too slow."
1,我们是从银滩的酒店住宿后，搬过来的，所以这个酒店虽然离银滩远点，但是也没觉得什么不便，每天去玩海也没什么意思。嘉莱总体的设施不错，比银滩那边的要强多了，舒适、宽敞、干净。我们住的是两室一厅的套房，才300多，总共有三个电视，中央空调，客厅、厨房都跟家里一样，床很大，如果要都住满，至少可以住四个人，大床有1米8，另一张有1米5。美中不足的是，厨房里尽管有微波炉、电饭煲，但没有餐具什么的，有点形同虚设，要不然可以去买点生猛海鲜自己煮来吃，更有意思。酒店里的室外游泳池挺不错，循环水系统，干净且人又少，大人、小孩在里面都可以找到适合自己的水深区域，有救生员，比较安全。以后如果有机会去北海，还会考虑住这里。对面的海鲜大排挡不知道什么原因，会人那么多，露天里吃，卫生也不咋地，问了一下价格，还没嘉莱自己酒店的便宜，还很拽。后来我们吃海鲜就在酒店餐厅吃，做得好，也干净。嘉莱的早、晚茶挺好，规模很大，也很实惠，跟广东那边的差不多。,"We moved over from the hotel in Yintan, so although the hotel was far from the Yintan, but I didn't feel inconvenient. It was not interesting to go to the sea every day.The overall facilities of Jialei are good, which is much stronger than the silver beach, comfortable, spacious, and clean.We live in a two -bedroom and one -living suit. There are only more than 300. There are three TVs. There are three TVs. The central air conditioner, the living room and the kitchen are the same as the home. The bed is very large. If you want to live, you can live at least four people.1 meter 8, the other is 1.5 meters.The disadvantage of the United States is that although there are microwave oven and rice cookers in the kitchen, there is no tableware or something. It is a bit like it. Otherwise, you can buy some raw seafood to cook it by yourself, which is more interesting.The outdoor swimming pool in the hotel is pretty good, the circulating water system, clean and fewer people. Adults and children can find the water depth area that suits them. It has a lifeguard and is safer.If you have the opportunity to go to Beihai in the future, you will consider living here.I do n’t know why the seafood gear across the opposite side is. There are so many people. They eat in the open air, and the hygiene is not good. I asked the price. Before the cheapness of Jiale's own hotel, it was very dragged.Later, we ate seafood in the hotel and restaurant. They did well and clean.Jiale's morning and evening tea are very good, the scale is large, and it is also very affordable."
0,网上介绍的比较好，但是实际却是另一番现象。交通非常不便，晚上除非包车，否则根本没法出行；另外酒店性质为居家酒店，服务态度、服务质量比较一般，周围环境也没有传说中的那么诗意化。如果想体验农村生活的话可以一住，否则可以考虑阳朔街上一带的住宿。,"The online introduction is better, but it is actually another phenomenon.Transportation is very inconvenient. Unless chartered car is chartered at night, it is impossible to travel at all. In addition, the nature of the hotel is home hotel, with average service attitude and service quality, and the surrounding environment is not as poetic as legendary.If you want to experience rural life, you can live, otherwise you can consider the accommodation on the area around Yangshuo Street."
0,"10月25日入住单人大床间一晚,感觉较差:1.晚上22:30左右入住,前台接待很冷淡,无笑容,感觉不亲切;2.最可怕的是冲澡3分钟后淋浴龙头停水,2分钟以后浴缸龙头也完全停水.没办法浴室内打电话给大堂,说派人上来看一下,这时发现房间内未配浴袍.后大堂副理上来,告诉也有其它房间有类似情况,因最近酒店附近管理维修.只是建议给换房间","Staying in the single -person bed for one night on October 25th, it feels worse: 1. Check in around 22:30 pm.The faucet stops water. After 2 minutes, the bathtub's faucet is completely stopped. There is no way to call the lobby in the bathroom and say that it is sent to see it. At this time, I found that there are no bath robes in the room.There are similar situations, because the recent management and maintenance near the hotel is just recommended to change the room"
0,以前在这里住过感觉还不错，但是这次很差劲，以后不住在这里了。1、天黑以后到的宾馆，出了电梯以后，楼道黑黑的，都看不清楚；2、订的“豪华数码间”，但是进去以后没有找到网线，随后打电话问客房服务，被告知需要用猫，于是去找。等了大约1个半小时才拿来……第二天，又被服务员借去用了半个小时；3、结算时，楼层服务员硬说是我消费了两个“和其正”，磨了近十分钟才搞清楚，他们连自己房间配了几个都不知道！4、晚上用餐是在房间里面，因为前台押金用的现金，所以身上的现金不够支付餐费了。于是和服务员商量在房间押金里面扣，或者第二天早晨出去回来以后给支付，但是被拒绝，只好又专门出去取现，这个宾馆位置又不好，没有建行，打车来回又花去十元……总评：房间一般，服务很差，服务员业务素质很差！,"I used to live here and I felt good, but this time I was very bad and I couldn't live here.1. The hotel where it arrived in the future, after the elevator was out, the corridor was dark and black, and I couldn't see it clearly;You need to use a cat, so go to find it.It took about an hour and a half before taking it ... The next day, it took half an hour by the waiter; 3. During the settlement, the waiter of the floor said that I spent two ""positive"" and grindedIt was only in the past ten minutes to figure out that they did not even know how many of their rooms were!4. Dining at night is in the room. Because of the cash for deposit at the front desk, the cash on the body is not enough to pay the meal fee.So discuss with the waiter in the room deposit, or pay for the payment after going out the next morning, but was rejected, so he had to go out for cash withdrawal. The location of this hotel was not good. There was no CCB.General comment: The room is general, the service is poor, and the service quality is poor!"
1,很不错的度假酒店，强烈推荐一下，真希望能多住几天，就是房价贵了些！,"Very good vacation hotel, I highly recommend it, I really hope to live a few more days, that is, housing prices are more expensive!"
1,7月16日入住，是在携程买的半自助自由行，所以携程已经处理好所有的文件，只提供了通行证就顺利入住，非常快，前台服务生也非常客气，很专业。酒店大堂有很贴心的安排，大人在办理入住的时候，孩子可以在一旁看迪士尼的动画片。酒店的房间住2个大人2个孩子都很宽敞，到处都可以看见米奇的形象，让我们大人也回到了童年的时光。,"Checking on July 16th was a semi -self -service free travel bought in Ctrip, so Ctrip has handled all the documents, and only provided a pass to stay smoothly. It was very polite and professional.The hotel lobby has a very intimate arrangement. When adults apply for check -in, children can watch Disney cartoons on the side.The hotel's rooms live in two adults and 2 children. They can see Mickey's image everywhere, so that our adults also return to their childhood."
1,"通过携程预定的酒店,似乎总是星级酒店的""下人房""。酒店安排了35楼的房间，是酒店最高的房间。房间之小，令人称奇，下床就能撞上墙或者橱。看电视，颇有陶渊明之风：“采菊东篱下，悠然见南山”--为节约空间，电视与床是平行的。更过分的是，36楼以上，是另一家酒店正在装修。不仅可以尽享“吱吱哑哑”的装修声，还有嗅觉的无限体验。窗口的VIEW是3栋摩天大楼的外墙，在阳光的照耀下熠熠生辉。感觉实在不好。联系总台要求换房。服务员的态度还算很好。马上有人来带我看了24楼的房间，并予以更换。房间可大多了，还可以看到维多利亚港。酒店不豪华，但是感觉还好。每天有水果和巧克力，提供浴盐，洗漱用品也不错，房间打扫也勤快。地理位置很好，到太平山索道不过步行10分钟，到地铁更是方便，大楼的LG就是地铁入口了，方便购物的。去机场也方便，楼下就是机场快线。服务也不错吧，中规中矩。不寄予豪华期望的话，酒店应该还是不错的。","Through the hotel booked by Ctrip, it always seems to be the ""lower -person room"" of star hotels.The hotel arranged the room on the 35th floor, the highest room in the hotel.The small room is surprising, and you can hit the wall or the cabinet when you get out of bed.Watching TV, there is quite the wind of Tao Yuanming: ""Under the East Restaurant of Chrysanthemum, see Nanshan leisurely"" -It is to save space, TV and bed are parallel.What's more, above the 36th floor, another hotel is being renovated.Not only can you enjoy the ""squeak"" decoration sound, but also an unlimited experience of smell.The View of the window is the outer wall of the three skyscrapers, which shines under the sun.It feels bad.Contact the main station to change the house.The waiter's attitude is quite good.Someone immediately came to see the room on the 24th floor and replaced it.The rooms are mostly, and Victoria Harbor can be seen.The hotel is not luxurious, but it feels okay.There are fruits and chocolates every day, providing bath salt, and good washing products, and the room cleaning is also diligent.The geographical location is very good. It is more convenient to walk to the Taiping Mountain ropeway for 10 minutes. It is more convenient to go to the subway. The LG of the building is the subway entrance, which is convenient for shopping.It is also convenient to go to the airport, and downstairs is the airport express line.The service is also good, it is quite satisfactory.If there is no luxury expectations, the hotel should still be good."
0,酒店装修，档次太低。浴室很差。冬季不给开空调，说是开地热，其实地热根本不热，外面下大雪，屋里也不暖和，房间隔音不好，总体性价比不高，就一个招待所，原来订了2天，住了1天就逃了，下次去一定不会选那里。宾馆反馈2008年6月10日：燕赵之星商务酒店始终定位在为各位朋友提供，一个经济、舒适、品味、现代的居住场所。关于舒适：饮品.在每个房间我们都配备了饮水机以及真空包装的茶和咖啡，免费提供给客人；卫浴.房间内的所有卫浴用品都分为AB版便于使用；床上用品.枕头准备了两个一个是高枕，一个是荞麦低枕，满足不同的需要；我们希望通过我们的不断的努力，在今后的工作中更加注重细节，相信我们能够为您提供一个经济、舒适、品味、现代的居住场所。,"The hotel decoration is too low.The bathroom is poor.The air conditioner is not given in winter. It is said that the ground is hot. In fact, the geothermal is not hot at all. It is snowing outside, the room is not warm, the room's sound insulation is not good, and the overall cost performance is not high.God fled, and you will not choose there next time.Hotel feedback on June 10, 2008: Yan Zhaozhixing Business Hotel is always positioned to provide friends, a place of economy, comfort, taste, modern residence.About comfort: drinks.

I believe we can provide you with a economy, comfort, taste, modern oneLiving place."
0,酒店的地理位置不好，出门要门童叫个出租车，等了10分钟门童才把车叫过来，慢！洗澡花洒的出水一点不大，不急和五星的酒店设施一点也不配！最奇怪的时，我退房的时候边上有个人在checkin好像也是通过携程预定的，前台居然在和他说，你可以把携程的预定取消，我们现在的前台价格比携程的低，还有什么其他优惠什么的，真的，那个客人把携程的预定取消了，按前台给的价格checkin了。携程如果不相信的话你们可以查我退房那天中午11点左右的时候有没有取消这个酒店的预定，好像是个台湾人。,"The hotel's geographical location is not good. When you go out, you ask the door to call a taxi. After waiting for 10 minutes, the door child calls the car over, slow!The water out of the bathing shower is not a little bit, and it is not worthy of the five -star hotel facilities!At the stranger, when I got out of the room, someone on the side seemed to be booked through Ctrip. The front desk was telling him that you can cancel the reservation of Ctrip. Our current front desk price is lower than Ctrip, and there is still the price of Ctrip.What other discounts or something, really, the guest canceled the booking of Ctrip and checkin at the front desk.If you don't believe it, you can check whether I have canceled the hotel's booking at about 11 noon on the day of check -out. It seems to be a Taiwanese."
1,"前台的小姐呆头呆脑的,入住手续超级慢,早饭还行,吃的东西不少,就是层次比较低,吃饱为主,离开灵隐寺很近,烧香去的话,还可以,去游玩不推荐。","The lady at the front desk is dumbfounded, and she is very slow. Breakfast is okay. There are many things to eat. They are relatively low levels and are full of food. If they leave Lingyin Temple, it is very close."
0,"如果你想一个晚上不睡觉想心事,强烈推荐入住该宾馆。同样是高架边的饭店，其他宾馆都采用隔音玻璃，而陕西大厦却没有采用，夜深人静的时候就听到高架上滚滚的车流声！","If you want to do not sleep at night and think about things, it is highly recommended to stay in the hotel.It is also a hotel on the side. Other hotels use sound insulation glass, but the Shaanxi Building is not adopted. When the night is quiet, I hear the rolling traffic sound on the elevated!"
0,不好，感觉很差，特别是那服务态度，客人进来不闻不问，走时也没说“欢迎下次再来”，服务员脸上也基本看不到微笑，特别是那餐厅，我只能用“极差”二字形容，不好意思，因为我实在找不出比这更贴切的词汇了，在二楼用餐时，那服务员说的最多的就是“大家要吃好不要浪费”和“对不起，我们没菜了”，我看了一下表，才6：40，而晚餐时间是7：00结束，那么早就没菜了，那还叫“饭店”？后来一眼瞥见一块牌子，上面写道：食物没吃完，超出100g/10元收费。难道你们那饭是用金子做的？而且还抠门的很，饭凉了，用微锅炉加热，服务员一个劲得说“一分钟就够了，一分钟就够了”，我在想我们可是付钱进来的，可不是来受气的，更不是听你们说“现在菜贵了，我们都买不起菜”之类抱怨的话，所以我建议大家如果不是想来锻炼心理承受能力的或心理素质的，我相当不推荐此酒店,"It's not good, it feels bad, especially the service attitude. The guests come in and ignore, and they did not say ""Welcome to come again next time"" when they left.The word ""extremely bad"" is described, sorry, because I really can't find a more appropriate vocabulary than this. When dining on the second floor, what the waiter said the most is ""Don't waste it well"" and ""I'm sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry,We have no food. ""I took a look at the table, only 6:40, and the dinner time was over at 7:00, so there was no food early, so it was called"" restaurant ""?Later, I glanced at a brand, which wrote: The food was not eaten, and the charges exceeded 100g/10 yuan.Do you use gold?And it was very very cooler. The meal was cold, and the meal was cold. Heated with a micro -boiler. The waiter said that ""one minute is enough and one minute is enough."" I thought we paid for it.Not to listen to what you said, ""Now the dishes are expensive, we can't afford the dishes"", so I suggest that if you do not want to exercise your psychological tolerance or psychological quality, I do not recommend this hotel"
1,环境和房间设施都很舒适，服务也不错，经常还去一楼的西村喝温的清酒，刺身也是非常的新鲜，据说都是大连和日本直运过来的。,"The environment and room facilities are very comfortable and the service is good. I often go to West Village on the first floor to drink warm sake, and the sashimi is also very fresh. It is said that they were transported in Dalian and Japan."
1,主要是房间非常好，协程定了还不到400的豪华间，还送了一水果盘。唯一不足的就是房间有点老。据说周边新开了个香格里拉，所以应该会有比较实惠的价格来吸引人的。,"It is mainly because the room is very good. The coroutine has less than 400 luxury rooms, and a fruit plate is also given.The only disadvantage is that the room is a bit old.It is said that there is a new Shangri -La around, so there should be more affordable prices to attract people."
0,酒店位置还可以价格也勉强房间比较陈旧卫生状况也不太近人意总之不象三星级酒店,The location of the hotel can also be barely priced in the room.
1,非常好的酒店，四星的标准完全超值的享受，服务非常好,"Very good hotel, the standard of the four -star is fully value -for -money, the service is very good"
1,我们是第二次住这个酒店，第一次通过旅行社定的，很不爽，还在里面挣钱，加了价！通过携程定的很意外，还有酒店赠送的早餐，还是觉得携程的服务诚信度高！,"We have lived in this hotel for the second time. The first time we have been determined by the travel agency. It is very uncomfortable. We still make money inside and increase the price!It is very surprised by Ctrip, and the breakfast presented by the hotel, I still feel that Ctrip's service integrity is high!"
1,还不错，设施稍微有点旧但是可以接收，但是606的价格还不含早餐有点高了。楼下的商场和超市很方便。下次来还会选择这家。,"It's not bad. The facilities are a little old but can be received, but the price of 606 is not as high as breakfast.The shopping malls and supermarkets downstairs are convenient.I will choose this one next time."
0,普通的公寓房，服务水平差，不适合商旅人事入住。,Ordinary apartment housing has a poor service level and is not suitable for business and travel.
1,端午节去玩的，一直忘记评价了，呵呵地理位置：酒店的地理位置交通还算便利，不过去西湖还是有点远，走路的话还是颇痛苦设施：一般吧，装修比较久了，但设备还是比较齐全的交通：门口有不少公交车站，算方便服务：这个觉得比较一般，checkin和checkout的时候都比较久，期间多人退房的时候明显感觉手忙脚乱总体感觉，还算值吧,"I played for the Dragon Boat Festival, I have forgotten the evaluation. Hehe geographical location: The geographical location of the hotel is still convenient, but it is still a bit far away to the West Lake.Complete transportation: There are many bus stations at the door, which is convenient for service: This feels more general, Checkin and Checkout are longer."
1,根据大家的点评选择了这家酒店，总体感觉还是很不错的。此次预定的豪华A，因无房免费升级到行政间。房间比较宽敞，干净整洁，隔音不错，服务很温馨：千纸鹤，小便笺，还有清凉的绿豆汤和水果。点点细节体现着一个四星级酒店的服务。满意。再说点小插曲。在前台，服务生查看了预订情况，推荐我升级，我谢绝了他们的提议。之后说我订的是双床间，我说我要大床间（貌似预订时是无法选择大床还是双床的），接着便打电话询问有没有豪华大床间，听着他们一会儿说有一会儿说没有，弄得我一头雾水，最后告诉我：现在没有房间，因为这是酒店的缘故，所以给我免费升级。这个小插曲虽然让人有点不快，但终究本着顾客是上帝的原则去解决问题，比较满意。以后还会选择这里。宾馆反馈2008年8月13日：感谢您选择国宾大酒店入住并对酒店予以认可。看您的评论，猜想您可能是通过网络直接预订的房间吧？通过网络直接订房没有对房间特殊要求的选项(例如大床等特殊要求)。如果订房对房间有特殊要求，建议您拨打电话预订，酒店和携程的预订人员会共同做好记录，按您的要求提前准备房间。携程订房电话：800-820-6666，400-820-6666（手机）；酒店订房电话：0311-86911999。再次对您的点评表示感谢！祝心情舒畅，一切顺利。,"I chose this hotel based on everyone's reviews, and the overall feeling is still very good.The luxury A booked this time is upgraded to the administrative room for free.The room is relatively spacious, clean and tidy, good sound insulation, and warm service: thousands of paper cranes, urine notes, and cool mung bean soup and fruits.A little detail reflects the service of a four -star hotel.satisfy.Let's talk about some episodes.At the front desk, the waiter checked the booking situation and recommended me to upgrade. I declined their proposal.Later, I said that I ordered a double bed. I said that I want a big bed (it seems that when I book it, I can't choose a big bed or a double bed), and then I called to ask if there is a luxurious large bed, listening to them for a while, saying that there is any for a while, saying that there is any way to say that there is any for some time, there is a saying that there is any for some time.After a while, I said no, I made me confused, and finally told me: There is no room now, because it is because of the hotel, so I will upgrade for free.Although this episode is a bit unhappy, after all, the customer is solved in the principle of God as God, which is more satisfied.I will choose here in the future.Hotel feedback on August 13, 2008: Thank you for choosing a guest hotel to stay in and recognized the hotel.Look at your comments, guess you might be a room directly reserved through the Internet?Direct reservation through the network does not have special requirements for rooms (such as special requirements such as large beds).If the reservation has special requirements for the room, it is recommended that you call the booking, the reservation staff of the hotel and Ctrip will make a record and prepare the room in advance according to your requirements.Ctrip booking phone number: 800-820-66666, 400-820-6666 (mobile phone); hotel reservation phone: 0311-86911999.Thank you again for your comments!I wish you a comfortable mood and everything goes well."
1,服务基本不错，环境好，房间也还不错，就是叫出租车略有不便,"The service is basically good, the environment is good, and the room is not bad, but it is slightly inconvenient to call taxis"
1,"机场接机很贴心,前台也会询问是否要安静房.内部设施一般般,洗手台有些不方便.但是,当天我们是晚上11点到达桂林,工作人员很友好,很热情.当晚不慎把手机丢失在接机的面的车上.第二天早上还能失而复得.工作人员的这种精神值得称赞.总的来说,这家酒店让人觉得很温暖.机场专线就在楼下,去机场也很方便.","The airport pick -up is very intimate, and the front desk will also ask if the room is quiet. The internal facilities are generally the same, and there are some inconveniences of the washing table. However, we arrived at Guilin at 11 pm that day. The staff was very friendly and enthusiastic.Lost on the car that is lost on the pick -up. The next morning can be lost and recovered. This spirit of the staff is commendable. In general, this hotel makes people feel warm. The airport line is downstairs and go to the airportIt is also very convenient."
0,我凌晨12点半抵达时，房间居然完全没有收拾过，屋内有垃圾，洗手间里还有用过的卫生纸。我不得不干等了半个小时，等他们收拾好房间。然后早上8点就被酒店的施工人员吵醒。前台解决问题的态度还不错。,"When I arrived at 12:30 in the morning, the room had never been packed at all. There were garbage in the room, and the toilet paper used in the bathroom.I had to wait for half an hour and wait for them to clean up the room.Then he was awakened by the hotel construction staff at 8 am.The attitude of solving the problem at the front desk is not bad."
1,上星期住，地理位置方面。夜市近在一分之步程。北部亦只需行5-10分。但早餐有待改善！所自助早餐，一共只有10款之食物。其中一天因有旅行入住，食物更出不足之情形。,"Last week, in terms of geographical location.The night market is nearly one -point.The north also only needs 5-10 points.But breakfast needs to be improved!There are only 10 foods in the buffet breakfast.Among them, because of traveling in one day, the food is inadequate."
1,"还不错,就是房间和我预先看的不太一样,隔音不是很好~其它还不错~根据地段和价位,性价比还不错~补充点评2007年4月5日：缺点就是房间太小了~虽然不用,但是4星没有浴缸还是有点奇怪,如果价格包括早餐就更合理一些~住在这里的外宾居多,可能是10比一的感觉~","It's not bad, that is, the room is not the same as I read in advance. The sound insulation is not very good ~ Others are not bad ~ According to the location and price, the cost -effectiveness is not bad ~ Supplementary reviews on April 5, 2007: The disadvantage is that the room is too small ~ Although it is not necessary, But it ’s a bit strange that the 4 -star has no bathtub. If the price includes breakfast is more reasonable ~ Most foreign guests living here may be 10 to one."
0,酒店应该重视软件建设！特别是前台！！我们去入住，竟然告诉我们没有我们的名字，现在满房。查了很久说给你们换去锦江住。去锦江看了房，同意后回去刷卡，前台小姐态度傲慢：我们查到了，这次是你们自己不好！不是酒店责任！你们自己晚到了，我们就取消预定了。说名字是用你同伴的名字。,"Hotels should pay attention to software construction!Especially the front desk!IntersectionWe went to stay and told us that we did not have our name, now full of rooms.After checking it for a long time, I would like to change you to Jinjiang.I went to Jinjiang to see the room and agreed to go back to swipe the card. The lady of the front desk was arrogant: We found it, this time, you are not good!Not hotel responsibility!When you are late, we will cancel the booking.To say the name is the name of your companion."
1,环境非常幽静，我们去的时候正好是傍晚，夕阳照在房间前门的小院子里，光影关系特别漂亮，我和老公在院子里喝茶，很舒服。不过房间里的潮气很重，开窗放了很久，还是有味道，温度也比较低，开了一晚上的空调还是不觉得暖和。可能是因为房间比较大，密封不好的原因。,"The environment is very quiet. When we went, we happened to be in the evening. The sunset was in the small yard in front of the room. The relationship between light and shadow was particularly beautiful. My husband and I drink tea in the yard. It was very comfortable.However, the tide in the room is very heavy. After the window is opened for a long time, it still has a taste and the temperature is relatively low. The air conditioner that opened the night still does not feel warm.It may be because the room is relatively large and the seal is not good."
1,在西宁住过几个酒店，此酒店虽然比起内地的四星级差一些，但在西宁也算是不错的了，价格也不高。房间里东西倒是干净，地毯有点脏。用的是地暖，感觉比空调舒服多了，也没有噪音。安全，周围环境尚可。,"I have lived in a few hotels in Xining. Although this hotel is worse than the four -star in the Mainland, it is also good in Xining and the price is not high.The things in the room were clean and the carpet was a bit dirty.It uses floor heating, it feels much more comfortable than air conditioners, and there is no noise.Safe, the surrounding environment is acceptable."
1,"呵呵,毕竟是当地最好的酒店,所以,除了设施有","Haha, after all, it is the best local hotel, so except for facilities"
1,房间装饰不错也干净，环境也好，泳池水比较清洁，适合度假。,"The room decoration is good and clean, and the environment is good. The pool water is relatively clean and suitable for vacation."
0,离海边很近，但是房间的装修已经不是很新（海景房，1号楼），老式的宾馆，老式的服务。适合要求方便，但对房间设施不挑剔，要求不是太高的朋友补充点评2006年9月3日：比较过分的是所谓“海景房”（还要多加90元的）外面竟然首先是个堆放垃圾桶、扫把、拖把和打扫卫生者晾晒裤子的晒台，之后是个树林，再远处才是海，不知道这样的房间叫“海景房”合适不合适？；房间内霉味较重，打开窗户跑味半天时间也用处不大，个别墙壁角落处有霉点；床单、被褥的洁净程度很一般，比小旅馆还是要强，床看起来不是很平，但是睡着还凑活；枕套两套，上面的还算白（但是有洗不掉的污迹），下面稍灰；刚进入房间后不满霉味和所谓“海景”提出换房，当值的中年男人推诿多次无果，答应有退房的换，后来竟然告知一天都没有人退房。管理水平很一般，当然是和类似的小地方比，办手续的速度很慢，前台电脑里没有管理系统，竟然用的是word，好歹用个excel吧！这种管理落后的宾馆建议ctrip除名，要不以后怎么让人相信你们？,"It is close to the seaside, but the decoration of the room is not very new (sea view room, Building 1), old -fashioned hotels, old -fashioned services.Suitable for convenience, but not picky about room facilities, friends who are not too high to add comments on September 3, 2006: The so -called ""seascape house"" (more than 90 yuan) outside is the first place., Sweeping, mop, and cleaning sanitary people to dry their pants to dry their pants. Then there is a wooden forest, and there is a sea in the distance. I wonder if such a room is called ""sea view room"".; The mildew taste in the room is heavy, and it is not very useful to open the window to run for half a day. There are molds in the corners of individual walls; the cleanliness of the sheets and beddingSleeping and working together; two sets of pillow sets, the top is quite white (but there are stains that cannot be washed away), and the bottom is slightly gray; after entering the room, it is not full of mildew and the so -called ""sea view"".In the year, the man pushed out many times, and promised to have a check -out room. Later, he told no one for a day to check out.The management level is very average. Of course, it is compared with similar small places. The speed of handling procedures is very slow. There is no management system in the front desk computer. It uses Word. Anyway, use an excel!This kind of backward hotels recommend that CTRIP will be removed. How can I believe you in the future?"
0,第一：预订时要求免费宽带上网，可最终是“免费不能上网”，饭店解释由于饭店宽带设施原因，只能提供IP地址等，其他没有办法...－－－晕倒！第二：早餐20元质量还不如外面的地摊。第三：前台的服务因该再加强，不要有什么问题就找经理，然后下一句是经理不在。好在只住了一天，下次不在去住,"First: When reservation, you need to go online for free broadband, but in the end, it is ""free to access the Internet"". The hotel explains that because of the restaurant broadband facilities, you can only provide IP addresses. There is no other way ... --- fainted!Second: The quality of 20 yuan for breakfast is not as good as outside.Third: The front desk service should be strengthened because of the time, do not find any problems, and then find the manager, and then the next sentence is the manager's absence.Fortunately, I only live for a day, and I will not live next time"
0,都是如家快捷还真是千差万别。这家店一进门便是一股难闻的怪味，房间里面充斥着下水沟的味道。早餐更不敢恭维。只是为了办事方便。,"It is really different from home.As soon as this shop entered the door, it was a unpleasant smell, and the room was filled with the taste of the lower water ditch.Breakfast dare not compliment.It's just for convenience."
0,服务态度还可以，离景点也近，一入住的时候觉的还不错，可是晚上被咯吱咯吱的声音惊醒，还以为是床的质量不好，可是一开灯，发现一只老鼠正在肯我带去的小麻花，而且还和我们对视一分钟后才跑了。把我恶心的把所有的零食全扔了。告诉酒店，前台说让服务员过去看一下，难道老鼠还会乖乖的等你来看吗？退房的时候又提起此事，找经理说没上班，一句对不起就把我们给打发了。小地方的酒店真的不能住啊！,"The service attitude is okay, and the attractions are close to the attractions. When I check in, I feel pretty good, but I was woken up at night. I thought the quality of the bed was not good.The small twist that went to, and we ran away with us for a minute.Throw all the snacks all of me.Tell the hotel, the front desk said to let the waiter look at it in the past, will the mice be obedient to you?When checking out, I mentioned the matter again. I asked the manager to say that I didn't go to work.Hotels in small places really can't live!"
1,"同标准的酒店,价格上稍微一点贵!整体感觉还可以,位置很方便,我们公司的人每次去都住那!自助餐是不错滴!旁边的小吃广场...可以过过谗!","The same standard hotel, the price is slightly more expensive! The overall feeling is OK, the location is very convenient, the people in our company will live at each time! The buffet is good! The snack square next to it ... can be over!"
0,交通不方便不是自己车的话，很不方便的。尤其是在早上叫车他们没有时间观念！客房服务员爱骗人！前台的还可以！房间里有蚂蚁和不名小虫！我以后绝对不会在住那里了！同样的钱我宁愿去开元的！总体来说就可以用一个字概括就是“差”,"It is inconvenient to be inconvenient for transportation, which is not convenient.Especially in the morning, they have no concept of time!Guest room waiter loves deceiving!The front desk is ok!There are ants and unnamed worms in the room!I will never live there in the future!I would rather go to Kaiyuan in the same kind of money!Overall, you can use a word to sum up is ""poor"""
0,前台服务员3人，办理的只有1人，其他人据说是实习的不会办入住和退房，站一边看着，一般要等15分钟以上。入住的商务大床间，房间比较旧，一股怪味，洗手台等不是很干净，还有上网速度奇慢~！最后对于携程的客户好像有偏见，安排房间不好，入住不像会员赠送早餐，还有价格偏贵，只有比前台价格便宜十几元。。。反正以后不会入住这样的价贵物差的地方了，远不如一百多元的爱尊客呢。。,"There are 3 waiters at the front desk and only one person who handle it. Others are said to be internships that they do not check in and check out. They watch while watching, usually waiting for more than 15 minutes.In the large business bed, the room is old, a strange smell, the hand -washing table is not very clean, and the speed of Internet access is slow ~!In the end, there seems to be prejudice for Ctrip's customers.

1,突然要到香港办点急事，通过携程网订购了4日假期，真的很方便。没有买八达通卡，有携程网送的24小时地铁免费票足够了。rosedale位置很好，酒店房间虽小，但房间很高，设计合理、实用。干净，该预备的都预备了，包括雨伞。机场来回都坐E11(单程$21)既省银子又观光了。去时代广场方向不用过天桥。港岛太小了，走路都可以了，去九龙可以坐天星渡轮，看看星光大道观观维多利亚湾夜景。太平山顶可以坐缆车上去，但没有必要买摩天平台的票。,"Suddenly, I had to do something urgent in Hong Kong. It was really convenient to order the 4 -day vacation through Ctrip.com.There is no available in the Octopus card, and there are 24 -hour subway tickets sent by Ctrip.com.RoseDale is very good. Although the hotel room is small, the room is very high, and the design is reasonable and practical.Clean, all the preparations are prepared, including umbrellas.The airports are available in E11 (one -way $ 21).Do not need to cross the bridge in the direction of Times Square.Hong Kong Island is too small to walk. You can take the Diaoxing Ferry to go to Kowloon to see the night view of the Victoria Gulf of Stars Avenue.The top of Taiping Mountain can take the cable car, but there is no need to buy tickets for skyscrapers."
0,此酒店简直就是糟糕！环境很老久，离市区还有点远！住在里面的是大量的旅行社的团队，乱糟糟的。上网的话价格贵的吓死你！对于携程优先推介此酒店非常不满，绝对是给的返点比较多。不如住火车站对面的如家快捷商务酒店，上网还免费！不知道携程怎么搞的！自己的合资酒店不推介，搞个这个破酒店。,"This hotel is simply bad!The environment is very long, and it is a bit far from the urban area!Living in it is the team of a large number of travel agencies, messy.If you go online, the price is expensive to scare you!It is very dissatisfied with Ctrip to introduce this hotel first, and there are definitely more returns.It is better to stay opposite to the Railway Station Rujia Express Business Hotel, and it is free to go online!I don't know how to do it!It is not recommended by your own joint venture hotel."
1,推荐！！地理位置一走出来就是尖沙咀热闹地方，也就5分钟，性价比很高！一条路上还有君怡那个宾馆，但是好像君怡比它贵点，其实走出来也没差多少步，肯定这个核算！房间小一点，不过觉得还不错，意外还可以看到远方的海景，我住21楼，景色舒服！总体上来说不错！只是周围2个便利店没有什么花头。。。。。,"recommend!IntersectionAs soon as the geographical location comes out, it is Tsim Sha Tsui's lively place. It is only 5 minutes, and the cost performance is high!There is also Junyi's hotel on the road, but it seems that Junyi is more expensive than it. In fact, it is not much worse when you come out. It is certain that this account!The room is smaller, but I feel pretty good. I can also see the sea view in the distance accidentally. I live in the 21st floor and the scenery is comfortable!Generally speaking, it is good!It's just that there are no flowers around the two convenience stores around.EssenceEssenceEssenceEssence"
1,酒店离长途汽车站很近，走路5分钟就到了。整体环境不错，房间很干净。我住的是标准间，作为三星级酒店，我感觉很好了。服务态度很满意。沿着酒店大门前的路一直走就是鸣沙山。打车10元，公共汽车1元，酒店门口有站。据说是敦煌最贵的酒店了。不过我只住了一晚，就无所谓了。,"The hotel is very close to the long -distance bus station, and it will arrive in 5 minutes.The overall environment is good, and the room is clean.I live in a standard room. As a three -star hotel, I feel very good.The service attitude is very satisfactory.The road in front of the hotel's door has been walking.Tax 10 yuan, 1 yuan buses, there is a station at the entrance of the hotel.It is said to be the most expensive hotel in Dunhuang.But I only lived for one night, it didn't matter."
1,房间很干净完全对得起3星的标准服务态度也还可以保安警觉性也满好也满安静的早餐很差不是一般的差除了早餐外其他都满满意的。,"The room is very clean, which is worthy of the standard service attitude of 3 stars. You can also be full of security and alertness and quiet breakfast. It is very different from the general difference."
1,这是一个值得推荐的宾馆＃２楼标房仅280元确实是价廉物美，性价比很高，虽然卫生间小了一点。缺点是如果你带了很多行李就不方便了，我住的是＃２楼２层，实际上从大堂到房间要爬4层，还不算水平距离，好在还有服务生（这样的服务不给小费是不好意思的啦，仅管我没有付小费的习惯。）,"This is a recommended hotel # 280 yuan on the 2nd floor of only 280 yuan is indeed cheap and good, and its cost performance is very high, although the bathroom is a little smaller.The disadvantage is that if you bring a lot of luggage, it is inconvenient. I live in # 2nd floor and 2 floors. In fact, it must be climbed from the lobby to the room.It's sorry to give tipping, just, just don't have the habit of paying a tip.)"
1,"住的行政大床房,实在是喜欢西郊里的环境,院子里的黑天鹅,丹顶鹤,还有西郊的小野猫,繁华上海中的安逸休息之地,以后去上海都住这里.","The administrative big bed room where you live is really like the environment in the western suburbs, the black swan in the yard, the red -crowned crane, and the small wild cat in the western suburbs, the place where the bustling Shanghai rests, and live here in Shanghai."
0,住过差的，但没有住过这么差的！！昨晚00：00，一少妇在里面捉丈夫奸在房，大喊大闹，要死要活，炒得大家一晚没有睡好。提醒大家，酒店的保密工作很好！住起很放心。,"Living too badly, but not so bad!IntersectionAt 00:00 last night, a young woman caught her husband in the room, shouted to make trouble, and wanted to die and live, so that everyone did not sleep well all night.Remind everyone, the hotel's confidentiality work is very good!Stay at ease."
1,虽然房价贵了点，但是感觉是太原最好的宾馆了。整体感觉很好，就是周围没有什么好的餐馆。,"Although house prices are a bit expensive, it feels like the best hotel in Taiyuan.The overall feels good, that is, there are no good restaurants around."
0,1月7日入住，太一般了，对于2星降到1星或没有星级也就这样了。服务很差，服务员不知房内有客，未敲门竟直开门进入房间，要吓死人的。更痛苦的是，说是酒店，连饭都没地方吃，我是中午住进来的，没到晚饭时间就退房走人！,"Staying on January 7th, it is too average. This is the case for 2 stars to 1 star or no star.The service was very poor. The waiter did not know that there were guests in the room. He opened the door and went straight into the room to scare people.What is even more painful is that it is a hotel and there is no place to eat. I came in at noon. I left the room without dinner!"
1,嗯嗯，基本满意，只是对和我同去的老外分到的房间就比我N大有点不爽。浴缸的落水坏掉了，只能淋浴。不过来修的倒是挺快，虽然米有完全解决问题，至少还是很积极滴。,"Hmm, basically satisfied, just the room where the foreigners who went with me were a little uncomfortable than me N.The fall of the bathtub was broken and could only shower.However, it is very fast to repair. Although Mi has completely solved the problem, it is still very active."
0,"携程提供的160元的普通标间没有任何竞争力,房间设施一般,床单破损,服务也一般.商务豪华标间部分房间不是没有电脑,便是电脑只是摆设,连启动都不能.我在升级更换房间时便三易房间才能够正常入住.期待改进.","The 160 yuan ordinary standard room provided by Ctrip does not have any competitiveness. The room facilities are average, the sheets are damaged, and the service is also average. Some rooms in the business luxury standard room are not without computers, or the computer is just a furnishings.When the room is in the room, the three -e -room can stay normally. Looking forward to improvement."
1,房间服务还可以，只是离展馆有点远。在广交会期间，价格高也可以理解,"The room service is okay, but it is a bit far from the exhibition hall.During the Canton Fair, high prices can also be understood"
1,"整体环境不错,很干净,但叫花园饭店还有差距,绿化园景没则么看到,室内没有迷你吧(在四星级酒店不应该),两双拖鞋不同型号,一双有红边,一双没有,不协调,住在一楼,窗前一直有饭店人员走动(特别是中午),没有私密感,不敢开窗,配套服务很不错,但人手太少,我们两个人想去去洗个头,但只有一名服务人员,我只能回房自己洗.总体较满意,CHECKIN","The overall environment is good, very clean, but there is still a gap in the Garden Hotel.

There is no sense of private secrets, dare not open the window, the supporting service is very good, but the two people are too small., But there is only one service staff, I can only go back to the room to wash it myself. Overall is more satisfied, checkin"
0,建议携程取消该酒店的协议。这家酒店的三星不知道是怎样评出来的？房间小不说，隔音效果极差而且有怪味，下水道堵了没人管，三星级酒店竟然早上没有热水，服务人员态度生硬，一副爱住不住的嘴脸。明明是包括早餐的，服务员愣说不含早，众目睽睽之下好像我们想赖他一顿早餐，后经证实是携程订的房才勉强同意提供早餐，但是不允许我们和其他客人一样自助，由服务员在自助餐盘里随便拣几样端上来。最不能让人忍受的是服务员竟然当着客人的面用他那双刚刚扔下抹布的脏手抓起剥了皮的卤蛋放到自助餐盘里；上了桌的菜客人已经用过，仍然可以倒回自助餐盘里去，真让人恶心！经过携程反,"It is recommended to cancel the hotel agreement.Samsung at this hotel does not know how to comment?The room is small, the sound insulation effect is very poor and strange. No one cares about the sewer. There is no hot water in the morning in the Sanxing Hotel.Obviously, it includes breakfast. The waiter said that it does not include early. In the eyes of the eyes, it seems that we want to rely on his breakfast. It is confirmed that the house booked by Ctrip barely agreed to provide breakfast, but we are not allowed to self -help us as other guests.The waiter picks up a few samples in the buffet plate.The most unbearable thing is that the waiter actually used his pair of dirty hands to grab the peeled braised eggs in front of the guests with the dirty hand of his pair of rags.It can be poured back to the buffet plate, which is really disgusting!Ctrip"
0,我于2008，01，15入住，房间消毒水味很浓，很冷，开了空调，盖两张床的被子还是没点暖意，其他设施皆破旧，绝不会再入住！甚至于因为这间房差点都不想再用携程的订房服务。,"I stayed in 2008, 01, and 15. The room had a strong smell of water and cold. It was cold. I opened the air conditioner. The quilt covering the two beds was still not warm.Even because of this room, I don't want to use Ctrip's booking service anymore."
0,房间真是好小，而且有股霉味，床单没洗干净，有不明的污渍，打到客房部要求换没人接电话，只能打到前台，送来条床单，我要求铺上，服务员说自己是前台的不负责铺床，客房部的人下班了，我只能自己铺。看上面几位评价数字电视比较吸引人，我觉得真是没什么可看的，存储的电影少得可怜，连续剧根本打不开。下次不会去住了。,"The room is really small, and it has a moldy smell. The sheets are not cleaned. There are unknown stains. When you call the room department, you ask no one to answer the phone. You can only call the front desk and send it.I am not responsible for the bed in the front desk. People in the guest room department are off work. I can only spread it myself.Looking at the above -mentioned evaluation of digital TVs is more attractive, I think there is really nothing to watch. The stored movies are so pitiful that the continuity cannot be opened at all.I won't live next time."
1,2008年7月16日晚上11点多，我入住了这家酒店，因为这家酒店离张家界荷花机场非常近，步行不到10分钟。酒店前台有一个瘦高的小伙子接待，虽然已经很晚，但是小伙子的态度很好。房间给我最大的感受就是床非常干净，特别舒适，卫生间配有吹风机，柜子里配有两个防毒面罩，门背后张贴有详细的紧急疏散示意图。次日早晨起来，拉开窗帘，就看到了酒店背后的小山小道，绿油油的，风景很美，空气也不错。另外，酒店还送早餐，味道还不错，吃得比较舒服。,"At 11 o'clock in the evening on July 16, 2008, I stayed in this hotel because the hotel was very close to the Zhangjiajie lotus airport and walked less than 10 minutes.There is a lean guy for reception at the front desk of the hotel. Although it is very late, the guy's attitude is very good.The biggest feeling for the room to give me is that the bed is very clean and comfortable. The bathroom is equipped with a hair dryer. The cabinet is equipped with two anti -toxic masks. There is a detailed emergency evacuation schematic in the back of the door.The next morning, I opened the curtains and saw the hills behind the hotel. The green is green, the scenery is beautiful, and the air is good.In addition, the hotel also gives breakfast, the taste is not bad, and it is more comfortable to eat."
1,我现在就在后海房间里，为什么要现在评呢：是因为看了下面的一些评论，急于谈自己的现实感受――好像与他们感觉有些出入。同感：沿石镜街、万马路，有车过时，确实很吵。异感：1.服务员好像不是那么懒散啊：有问必答，讨要网线后5分钟内送到房间；2.订的是时尚单间，看似LP很满意，我就当然没意见啊；3.免费上网、长途电话，怎一个爽字了得；4.明天继续，有待继续观察。结束后，如有变化会再评；否则，以此为准。,"I am in the Houhai room now, why do I have to comment now: I read some of the following comments and eager to talk about my actual feelings -it seems that I feel a little different from them.Same feel: Along Shizhen Street and Wanma Road, there are really noisy cars.Different sensations: 1. The waiter doesn't seem to be so lazy: there is a question of answering, send it to the room within 5 minutes after asking for the network line;. Free Internet access, long -distance calls, how can a cool word get it; 4. Continue tomorrow, to continue to be observed.After the end, it will be reviewed if there is a change; otherwise, it will be based on this."
1,交通方便，搭机场快线香港站出来坐H1直达，步行到地铁站5分钟，门口就有叮叮车；房间虽小，但干净整洁，在香港已算不错了；周边各式餐厅很多，吃饭不成问题；酒店离金紫荆广场近，早上可以步行去看升旗仪式。,"The transportation is convenient. Take the airport Express Hong Kong and take H1 to reach the H1 and go directly to the subway station for 5 minutes. There is a Ding Ding car at the door; although the room is small, it is clean and tidy, and it is good in Hong Kong.It is not a problem; the hotel is close to the Golden Bauhinia Square. You can walk in the morning to see the flag -raising ceremony."
1,住了今晚三次了，每次都不甚满意，房间贼大，设备却陈旧，而且价格不低。这回订的套间，还竟然连个穿衣镜也没有。这么大套的房间，有大卧室一间，大客户一间，还有更衣室一间，还有个厨房（只对长期入住客户开放），竟然连个镜子没有，只有洗衣间的一个半身镜。,"I have lived three times tonight, and I am not very satisfied with each time. The room thief is large, the equipment is old, and the price is not low.This time the set of suites, there is even a dressing mirror.There are a large bedroom, a big customer, a locker room, and a kitchen (only open for long -term customers). There is no mirror.Essence"
0,"看携程上大家的点评不错，就订了间阳面220的房间，慕名前往。结果大失所望，灯光昏暗，空间极其狭小，床垫质量恶劣，房间还伴着一股霉味。原预计住上个把星期的，结果住了一晚就退房了。其实原本想着也就将就了，也许皇城根上这个地段这个价格就只能是这种水平了。但转机是在入住后第二天早上，我出宾馆在新街口大街上溜达，没走两分钟就发现一家连锁宾馆――欣燕都总店。看门脸不错就进去看了看房，顿时喜欢得不得了。房间设计简约而时尚，宽敞明亮，床也很舒服，同样有宽带。正是我喜欢的类型。赶紧回护国寺宾馆，上携程查了查，单人间的才200，套间竟然才240。超值！！同样的地段，更优越的条件，更低廉的价格。二话不说，立马下新订单，退房，拖着行李就搬去了欣燕都。而且欣燕都交通更便利，就在新街口大街上，门口就是公车站、出租车站。斜对面是新街口超市，新街口百货，而周围同样是典型的北京胡同。提醒一点，携程协议上""欣燕都""是没宽带的，但实际现在""欣燕都""是有的。说了这么多，该如何选择，大家应该很清楚了吧。（感觉自己像枪手似的，呵呵）另外，也希望护国寺宾馆能向竞争对手学习，好好改善改善。","Seeing that everyone's review on Ctrip is good, I booked the room of 220, and went to the world.As a result, it was disappointed, the lights were dim, the space was extremely small, the quality of the mattress was bad, and the room was accompanied by a moldy smell.Originally, I was expected to live for a week, but I went out for one night.In fact, it would be just thinking about it. Maybe the price of this location on the roots of Huangcheng can only be this level.But the turn of the turnaround the next morning after staying, I walked out of the hotel on the streets of Xinjiekou Street. I found a chain hotel -Xinyan Capital Store without walking for two minutes.I went in and looked at the house when I looked at the door.The room design is simple and fashionable, spacious and bright, the bed is also very comfortable, and there are also broadband.It is the type I like.Hurry back to the Guo Temple Hotel and Checai. The single room was only 200, and the suit room was only 240.Value!IntersectionThe same location, superior conditions, lower prices.Without saying a word, immediately place a new order, check out, dragged his luggage and moved to Xinyan capital.In addition, Xinyan's traffic is more convenient. On the streets of Xinjiekou, there are bus stops and rental stations at the door.On the opposite side is Xinjiekou Supermarket, Xinjiekou Department Store, and the typical Beijing Hutong is surrounded by.It is reminded that ""Xin Yandu"" on the Ctrip Agreement is no broadband, but in fact, ""Xin Yandu"" is actually available.Having said so much, how to choose, everyone should be very clear.(I feel like a gunman, haha) In addition, I also hope that the Guo Temple Hotel can learn from competitors and improve improvement."
1,酒店的的布置很舒适，位置也很好，在闹市区，有闹中取静的感觉。很不错！,"The hotel's layout is very comfortable and the location is very good. In the downtown area, there is a sense of quietness in trouble.very nice!"
0,"这个酒店有点慌的,下次不大会去住拉.呵呵","This hotel is a bit panic, I will stay in the next time."
1,宾馆总体给人感觉还不错，晚上睡觉很安静，院子里有宾馆放养的土鸡，还有两只秃了毛的孔雀。设施比较齐备。只不过510/1入住时前台的工作人员对于住客的饮食及旅游没有任何有用的建议，让人失望。第二天退房的时候，小姐的帮助就大了很多。早餐相较而言一般，种类很少，炒面和炒年糕味道还不错，不过不适合我这种早餐习惯清淡的人。,"The hotel is generally good. It is very quiet at night. There are native chickens in the yard, and two bald peacocks.The facilities are relatively complete.It's just that the staff at the front desk at 510/1 not have any useful suggestions for the diet and travel of the guests, which is disappointing.When checking out the next day, the help of the lady was much greater.Breakfast is generally average, there are very few types, and fried noodles and fried rice cakes are pretty good, but it is not suitable for people with light breakfast habits."
1,今年10月中旬住的主楼商务间，还可以。早餐马马虎虎。,The main building room where the main building lived in mid -October this year is okay.Breakfast horse tiger.
1,我定的是特价房，房间小点，还能接受，毕竟对旅游者来说呆在房间的时间比较少。酒店内环境不错，就是门外在施工，有点嘈杂。服务不错，门童很勤快，checkin，checkout也很迅速。就是莲蓬头不能取下有些不便。宾馆反馈2008年8月13日：非常感谢您选择入住中山国际，我们非常重视您对我们提出的意见。酒店边上的中山中路正在进行国际名品步行街改建，由此给您带来的种种不便我们深感抱歉。请您在预订房间时告知我们您对房间的要求，我们将为您安排合适的房间。衷心期待您的再次光临。,"I set a special room, a small room, and acceptable.

1,很不错，服务和房间设施等都很好。我是端午节和女朋友一起去的，女朋友手机没电可问总台借万能充电器，很快就送来了。那的饭菜也很不错，好吃，呵呵。总的来说很好,"Very good, service and room facilities are very good.I went with my girlfriend with my girlfriend. My girlfriend had no power on my mobile phone and asked the head station to borrow a universal charger, and it was delivered soon.The meal is also very good, delicious, haha.Overall"
0,一般，总的来说不及莫泰。交通也不是特别便利。以后不会在去这家酒店,"Generally, it is not as good as Motai.Transportation is not particularly convenient.I won't go to this hotel in the future"
1,"酒店的环境,房间和服务都不错,但是门口的保安就很差.让人联想到""打手"".再加上网上也有对保安的说法,以前还不以为然,现在不得不同意他们的说法了.宾馆反馈2008年6月12日：尊敬的客人：您好！看完您的点评，酒店曾第一时间试图联系您了解事情的始末，但未能联系到，我们深感遗憾！同时，酒店立即以书面形式责成酒店外保所属的物业公司需加强对安保的培训和督导，并以该案例为戒，切实做好对客服务工作，避免类似事件的再次发生，否则酒店有权中止和物业的合作。如家始终秉承为每一位宾客提供安全、洁净、温馨的住店环境，也真诚的希望每一位住店客人能对酒店的工作进行督导和建议。我们感谢所有帮助酒店健康成长的客人！","The hotel's environment, rooms and services are good, but the security guards at the door are very poor.

0,由于工作的关系，住过很多次，房间及酒店的设施比较老旧，服务不好，我两次将洗发液忘在房间里，查房时没有提醒，等过了几天去问，竟说找不到了。不是每个房间都有宽带，在开房时要提出要求。早餐质量比较差，15元的早餐没什么东西。,"Due to the work, I have lived many times. The facilities of the room and hotel are relatively old and the service is not good. I forgot to forget the shampoo in the room twice.I can't find it.Not every room has a broadband, requests when opening the house.The quality of breakfast is poor, and there is nothing for breakfast for 15 yuan."
1,据说这是北海最好的三星级酒店，生意不是一般的好，人气很旺，那天晚上到的时候大堂气氛浓烈，感觉很温馨。房间的卫生间小了点，不过服务好，心里就舒畅了。我住的房间还送早餐、果篮、晚上还有巧克力，最绝的是楼层服务员告诉我网络客人还可以免费烫衣服……哇。晚上大堂副理还电话拜访我，我告诉她电视调不好，她还亲自上来帮我调。总体感觉不错，大堂副理请我帮忙宣传一下，我同意了哈哈。,"It is said that this is the best Samsung hotel in Beihai. The business is not general and popular. The lobby atmosphere was strong and warm when that night arrived that night.The bathroom in the room is a little smaller, but the service is good, and the heart is comfortable.The room I lived also gave breakfast, fruit basket, and chocolate at night. The most absolutely the most absolutely floor waiter told me that online guests could also hot clothes ... Wow.At night, the deputy manager of the lobby also called me. I told her that the TV could not be adjusted well, and she also came up to help me.Overall feels good. The deputy manager of the lobby asked me to help promote it. I agree with haha."
1,感觉还是不错的，房间很大，也很干净，衣柜足够用。早餐还可以，只是感觉应提高点儿质量。,"It feels good, the room is large, clean, and the wardrobe is sufficient.Breakfast is okay, just feel the quality should be improved."
1,酒店设备，环境都还可以，就是早餐不怎么样。而且晚上有不明电话。女士接起来以后说是要不要足底按摩。希望可以改进。,"Hotel equipment, the environment is okay, that is, breakfast is not good.And there are unknown calls at night.After the lady picked it up, she said whether to massage her soles.Hope to improve."
1,酒店环境还可以，距离公交车站比较近，出行方便。一般的服务员很和气会主动向你问好，倒是看着象管理人员的从不见打招呼。比较郁闷的是，有一天服务员因为拿走了一筒快过期的冰箱里的饮料，没有交接清楚，下一班的人员误会是我们喝掉了。还有我预定的4天的房，结果到第三天上午房卡就被停掉了，害我从沙滩返回时只好先到大厅重新办理。早餐去的比较晚时感觉他们餐桌收拾的很慢，好像服务员不够用似的，看着将近7、8个没人坐的桌子却都有一摞待收拾的餐盘，没办法告诉服务员后半天才来收拾,"The hotel environment is okay, which is closer to the bus station and convenient travel.The general waiter will take the initiative to ask you hello, but watching the managers who never say hello.What is more depressed is that one day the waiter did not hand over the drink in the refrigerator that was about to expire. The person in the next class misunderstood that we drank it.There is also the 4 -day room I booked. As a result, the room card was stopped on the morning of the third day, and I had to go to the lobby to re -apply when I returned from the beach.When the breakfast went late, I felt that they packed very slowly at the table, as if the waiter was not enough. Looking at nearly 7 or 8 tables without people, there was a dinner plate to be cleaned.Come to clean up"
1,本次出差临时入住此酒店（携程推荐此酒店入住率比较高）。酒店为挂牌4星，环境不错，卫生间内设施陈旧，至少10年没有更换设施了，标准A.B房的卫生间面积4平米左右，比较拥挤。前台服务已经达到4星标准，餐厅服务管理有些欠缺。酒店签约客户标准A房只有180元（是否含早情况不明），相比携程的价格还是有较大差距，希望在价格方面携程还要多与酒店交涉，给我们会员更好的服务。,"This hotel is temporarily staying in this hotel (Ctrip recommends that this hotel has a high occupancy rate).The hotel is listed 4 stars, the environment is good, and the facilities in the bathroom are old. At least 10 years have not been replaced, the standard A.B room is about 4 square meters, which is more crowded.The front desk service has reached the 4 -star standard, and the restaurant service management is a bit lacking.The hotel signing the customer standard is only 180 yuan (whether the early situation is unknown). Compared with the price of Ctrip, there is still a large gap. I hope that Ctrip will negotiate with the hotel more in terms of price to give our members better services."
