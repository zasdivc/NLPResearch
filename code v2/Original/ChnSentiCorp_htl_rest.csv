1,商务大床房，房间很大，床有2M宽，整体感觉经济实惠不错!,"The large business bed room, the room is large, the bed is 2m wide, and the overall feel is good for economy!"
1,早餐太差，无论去多少人，那边也不加食品的。酒店应该重视一下这个问题了。房间本身很好。,"Breakfast is too bad, no matter how many people go, there is no food over there.The hotel should pay attention to this problem.The room itself is very good."
1,宾馆在小街道上，不大好找，但还好北京热心同胞很多~宾馆设施跟介绍的差不多，房间很小，确实挺小，但加上低价位因素，还是无超所值的；环境不错，就在小胡同内，安静整洁，暖气好足-_-||。。。呵还有一大优势就是从宾馆出发，步行不到十分钟就可以到梅兰芳故居等等，京味小胡同，北海距离好近呢。总之，不错。推荐给节约消费的自助游朋友~比较划算，附近特色小吃很多~,"The hotel is on the small street, it is not easy to find, but fortunately, there are many enthusiastic compatriots in Beijing ~ The hotel facilities are similar to the introduction. The room is small and it is really small, but the low price factors are still worth it; the environment is good; the environment is good; the environment is good;In the Little Hutong, quiet and tidy, good heating -_- ||.EssenceEssenceHey has a big advantage that starts from the hotel, and you can go to Mei Lanfang's former residence in less than ten minutes. Jingwei Xiaohu is the same, Beihai is very close to Beihai.In short, yes.Recommended for self -service friends who save consumption ~ more cost -effective, there are many specialty snacks nearby ~"
1,"CBD中心,周围没什么店铺,说5星有点勉强.不知道为什么卫生间没有电吹风","CBD Center, there are no shops around, saying that 5 stars are a bit reluctant. I don’t know why there is no hair dryer in the bathroom"
1,总的来说，这样的酒店配这样的价格还算可以，希望他赶快装修，给我的客人留些好的印象,"In general, such a hotel is okay with such a price. I hope he will make a good impression on my guests quickly and give my guests a good impression."
1,1。酒店比较新，装潢和设施还不错，只是房间有些油漆味。2。早餐还可以，只是品种不是很多。3。交通比较方便，周围的小饭店比较多。,"1.The hotel is relatively new, the decoration and facilities are pretty good, but the room has a paint flavor.2.Breakfast is okay, but there are not many varieties.3.The transportation is more convenient, and there are more small restaurants around."
1,我住的是特色标间，所谓特色，是有些类似家的感觉。寝具不是单调的白色，是条纹和大格子的，感觉很温馨。圈儿椅的靠垫是卡通的加菲猫头，明黄的颜色有点扎眼，和周围配在一起感觉有点不协调。客房硬件评价3.5分。加湿器、烫衣板、电熨斗、吹风机、小冰箱等俱全。缺点：液晶电视固定在墙上，位置不好。一是遮挡了一个电源插座；二是与桌子搭配不当。桌子（与冰箱柜一体）在电视下方，如果坐在桌子旁上网或工作学习，正好挡住了电视屏幕。错开坐，正好是冰箱柜，腿脚伸不开。,"I live in a characteristic standard room. The so -called characteristic is a bit similar to the family.Bedding is not monotonous white, it is stripes and large grids, and it feels very warm.The cushion of the circle chair is the cartoon Garfield's head. The color of the bright yellow is a bit eye -catching, and it feels a bit uncoordinated with the surroundings.The hardware evaluation of the rooms is 3.5 points.The humidifier, hot clothing board, electric iron, hair dryer, small refrigerator, etc.Disadvantages: LCD TV is fixed on the wall, and the location is not good.The first is to block a power socket; the other is not properly paired with the table.The table (integrated with the refrigerator cabinet) is below the TV. If you sit by the table or work and study, just block the TV screen.Sitting open, just the refrigerator cabinet, the legs and feet are not open."
1,早餐很丰富，服务也热情，早上很早退房时，前台值此人员办理手续也非常快．,"Breakfast is very rich and the service is also enthusiastic. When you check out early in the morning, the front desk is also very fast."
1,好像跟洪崖洞酒店一个公司的，所以房间的风格比较接近，就是小一些，整体来说比较不错，房间内食品都是免费，很实在。就是早餐实在不敢恭维，大堂环境比较差。整体来说不错，属于比较好的三星级酒店。,"It seems to be a company with Hongya Dong Hotel, so the style of the room is closer, which is small, and the overall is relatively good. The food in the room is free and very real.That is, the breakfast is really dare to compliment, and the lobby environment is relatively poor.Overall is good, it is a better Samsung hotel."
1,"价格偏高,服务一般.窗外风景ok.早餐还不错","The price is high, the service is average. The scenery outside the window is OK. Breakfast is not bad"
1,知道网线接口在哪儿吗？比高家庄的地道口还隐蔽。在床头柜后面！想不道吧？看你怎么用。1：自带4米以上网线；2：自带小板凳：3：房间的垃圾桶可翻过来坐......,Do you know where the network cable interface is?The authentic entrance of Gaojiazhuang is still hidden.Behind the bedside table!Don't think about it?See how you use it.1: Comes with a network cable of more than 4 meters; 2: Bring a small bench: 3: The trash can in the room can be turned over ...
1,沈阳市政府的酒店，比较大气，交通便利，出门往左就是北陵公园，环境好。,The hotel of the Shenyang Municipal Government is relatively atmospheric and convenient for transportation. It is Beiling Park to the left. The environment is good.
1,总体感觉不错，美中不足的是房与房之间隔音效果不太好，还有房价感觉稍高。,"The overall feeling is good. The shortcomings are not good at the room and the room, and the house price feels slightly higher."
1,"设施虽稍陈旧一些,但良好的服务给人温暖.酒店所处地理位置和环境极好.对年龄较大的个人旅游者而言,入住该酒店不失为较佳选择.","Although the facilities are slightly older, good services give people warm. The geographical location and environment of the hotel are excellent. For older personal tourists, it is a better choice to stay in the hotel."
1,早餐很不错，离市中心比较近，购物方便，但是5号楼的房间相当于3星标准。不过相对于房价也值了补充点评2008年8月11日：另外，房间提供的拖鞋太小了，根本穿不下，难道是给女士设计的？我是42码的脚啊。宾馆反馈2008年8月14日：尊敬的宾客：您好！感谢您入住金陵溧阳宾馆！并及时把您的感受和意见告知我们！对于你提出的拖鞋太小的问题。等您下次入住金陵溧阳宾馆时只需向我们的服务员提出。我们将根据您的意见记录特别需求，提供您满意的服务！，发扬金陵溧阳宾馆“以客为尊”的服务理念，让每一位宾客都能对金陵溧阳宾馆留下美好而深刻的印象。再次向您表示感谢！期待您的再次光临！祝您工作顺利！身体健康！金陵溧阳宾馆客务关系主任,"Breakfast is very good. It is closer to the city center and is convenient for shopping, but the room in Building 5 is equivalent to the 3 -star standard.However, it is also worth a supplementary review on August 11, 2008: In addition, the slippers provided by the room are too small and cannot be worn at all. Is it for the lady?I am 42 yards.Hotel feedback on August 14, 2008: Dear guest: Hello!Thank you for staying at the Jinling Puyang Hotel!And inform us of your feelings and opinions in time!For the problem you raised too small.When you stay at the Jinling Puyang Hotel next time, you only need to propose to our waiters.We will provide your satisfaction service based on your special needs!, To carry forward the service concept of ""Visit"" of Jinling Puyang Hotel, so that every guest can leave a good and deep impression on Jinling Puyang Hotel.Thank you again!welcome next time!I wish you a smooth work!In good health!Jinling Puyang Hotel's Director Director"
1,房间稍小，但清洁，非常实惠。不足之处是：双人房的洗澡用品只有一套.宾馆反馈2008年8月5日：尊敬的宾客：您好！感谢您选择入住金陵溧阳宾馆！对于酒店双人房内的洗漱用品只有一套的问题，我们已经召集酒店相关部门对此问题进行了研究和整改。努力将我们的管理与服务工作做到位，进一步关注宾客，关注细节！再次向您表示我们最衷心的感谢！期待您能再次来溧阳并入住金陵溧阳宾馆！让我们有给您提供更加优质服务的机会！顺祝您工作顺利！身体健康！金陵溧阳宾馆客务关系主任,"The room is slightly smaller, but clean and very affordable.The disadvantage is: there is only one set of bath supplies in the double room. Hotel feedback on August 5, 2008: Dear guest: Hello!Thank you for choosing to stay at the Jinling Puyang Hotel!There is only one problem for the washing supplies in the hotel's double room.

1,3人间还是比较大的，就是暖气不是太暖和，时冷时热。被单会有油污的地方，不过还可以接受。洗漱间和厕所没有暖气洗澡刚开始会较冷。24小时热水、比较周到的服务、桶式饮用水还是不错的。周围环境还可以比较安静，西到西直门、动物园；北到积水潭、新街口豁口；南到西单；东到后海还是比较方便的地理位置。豁口新开的新华百货商场比较气派，还不错可以逛逛。推荐居住！,"The three people are still relatively large, that is, the heating is not too warm, it is cold and hot.There will be oil stains alone, but it is acceptable.The bathroom and toilet did not have a heating to take a bath. It would be colder at first.24 -hour hot water, thoughtful service, and barrel drinking water are still good.The surrounding environment can also be relatively quiet, west to west straight door, zoo; north to Qishuitan, Xinjiekou gap; south to west alone; east to Houhai is still more convenient geographical location.The newly opened Xinhua Department Store is more elegant, and it is good to visit.Recommended living!"
1,我们住的是8号五星楼，总体来讲还可以，服务还有些欠缺，退房是时间太长宾馆反馈2008年5月6日：非常感谢您入住金陵溧阳宾馆，并通过网站将您的入住感受与我们分享。我们宾馆始终致力于不断提升酒店的软件和硬件设备，为客人提供良好的入住环境和美好的入住体验，您的意见我们已做过专题讨论会，对于退房等一系列服务已做出改进。恭候您的再次光临！,"We live in the five -star building on the 8th. Generally speaking, the service is still lacking. The check -out is too long Hotel to feedback May 6, 2008: Thank you very much for staying at the Jinling Puyang Hotel, and pass your stay through the websiteFeel sharing with us.Our hotel has always been committed to continuously improving the hotel's software and hardware equipment, providing guests with a good check -in environment and a beautiful check -in experience. Your opinion has done a special discussion, and a series of services such as check -up have been improved.Waiting for you to come again!"
1,帮JJ定的好像不怎么样哦水好像差点意思补充点评2008年3月29日：我点了3分怎么还是显示4分啊,"Help JJ's fixed seems not very good. Water seems to be almost meaningful to add comments on March 29, 2008: Why do I still show 3 points and show 4 points?"
1,房间还可以，楼下有食街，服务态度很好！不过网络不太好，总是断线；早餐一般般。,"The room is okay. There is a food street downstairs, and the service attitude is very good!However, the network is not very good, and it is always broken; breakfast is generally like."
1,去住的话最好是住朝向大院的房间，因为酒店后面有中央空调的一些设备，晚上响起来的话影响休息的。早餐很一般，没甚么好吃的东西。酒店旁边有条小路，那里有几家实惠的小饭店，比如私家菜甚么的。总的来说，出差宜兴，国际饭店还是第一选择。,"If you live, it is best to live in the room of the big courtyard, because behind the hotel has some equipment of the central air conditioner, it will affect the rest at night.Breakfast is very average, there is nothing delicious.There is a small road next to the hotel, where there are several affordable small restaurants, such as private food or something.Overall, on a business trip, the international hotel is still the first choice."
1,自助早餐非常好，服务很周到，下次还会去住。,"The buffet breakfast is very good, the service is very thoughtful, and I will live next time."
1,前台小姑娘很有意思，经常入住，都熟了，呵呵,The little girl at the front desk is very interesting. She often moves in and is familiar. Haha
1,相当于五星的服务，好于四星的早餐，差不多三星的房价就是要借东西补充点评2008年5月12日：有个印度啊三，很有派头，服务热情,"It is equivalent to the five -star service, which is better than four -star breakfast. Almost Samsung's house prices are to use things to add comments on May 12, 2008: There is an Indian three, very enthusiastic, service enthusiasm"
1,离机场很近，房间里的床很大，里面还有一面镜子,"It's close to the airport, the bed in the room is very large, and there is a mirror in it"
1,超赞！虽然窗正对中环，但一点也不觉得吵。房间很干净、整齐，给人很舒服的感觉，服务也很好，价格也不贵，非常满意！,"Awesome!Although the window is facing Central, I don't feel noisy at all.The room is very clean and neat, it feels comfortable, the service is also very good, the price is not expensive, very satisfied!"
1,大堂不错，有四星的样子，房间的设施一般，感觉有点旧，卫生间细节不错，各种配套东西都不错，感觉还可以，有机会再去泰山还要入住。,"The lobby is good. There are four stars. The facilities in the room are average. It feels a bit old. The details of the bathroom are good. Various supporting things are good. It feels okay. If you have the opportunity to go to Taishan, you have to stay."
1,不错的酒店!房间较大并舒适!因为是住21层很安静!1楼餐厅菜肴价廉物美就是品种很少!是桐乡很好的酒店!,Good hotel! The room is large and comfortable! Because it is very quiet to live in the 21st floor! The price of the restaurant on the first floor is very good. There are very few varieties! It is a good hotel in Tongxiang!
1,性价比较高，硬件设施比过去更加改善。满意！,"The cost is relatively high, and the hardware facilities are more improved than in the past.satisfy!"
1,"商务标间房间比较大,但洗手间很小.隔音效果也不太好.总体说来还算干净,整洁.交通很方便,离静安寺很近.","The business room room is relatively large, but the toilet is very small. The sound insulation effect is not very good. Generally speaking, it is clean, clean. The transportation is very convenient, and it is very close to Jing'an Temple."
1,房间太小了，而且我自己用格林豪泰的会员卡定的房间比携程定的房间好，他是五楼的最后一间房，好像是522吧，房间很大，而且床也超大的，比1米8的大多了，希望携程以后可以提供这样的房间,"The room is too small, and I use Green Haotai's member Kedar's room to be better than the Cable. He is the last room on the fifth floor. It seems to be 522. The room is large and the bed is too large.There are most than 1.8 meters. I hope Ctrip can provide such a room in the future"
1,价廉物美的好选择，晚上到机住十分合适，服务很热情，房间没地毯很清爽，海景很好看,The good choice for cheap and good quality. It is very suitable to live in the machine at night. The service is very enthusiastic. The room is very refreshing. The sea view is very good.
1,"酒店的设施和环境都不错的,就是周围没有什么集市和超市,在房间的阳台上就能看到一望无际的大海,真的心情非常的不错.唯一的就是每天的早餐都是一样的东西.离机场和市区也不是太远.(30元内都能搞定).","The hotel's facilities and environment are good, that is, there are no markets and supermarkets around. You can see the endless sea on the balcony of the room. Really a good mood. The only thing is that the breakfast every day is the same thing.It is not too far from the airport and the urban area. (It can be done within 30 yuan)."
1,地理位置还可以，在西湖边上，附近有一些大排挡，饮食也比较方便。酒店服务很好，服务生和前台人员都很热情，房间大而整洁，价格性价比高，如果下次去西湖还会入住。,"The geographical location is okay. There are some large gears near the West Lake, and the diet is more convenient.The hotel service is very good, the waiters and front desk staff are very enthusiastic, the room is large and neat, and the price is cost -effective. If you go to West Lake next time, you will stay."
1,标准的商务酒店，最大的优点就是位置好。房间比较干净，设施还行，但有些细节还需要改进。楼层服务员很不错（上次住的6楼，在这里表扬一下这位服务员），收拾房间，做清洁很及时，认真，走的时候有东西忘了，追了我好长一段距离告诉我。最近浦东大道修路，附件象个打工地。,"Standard business hotels, the biggest advantage is that the location is good.The room is relatively clean and the facilities are okay, but some details need to be improved.The floor waiter is very good (the 6th floor I lived last time, praise the waiter here), clean up the room, clean it in a timely and timely, serious, and forget it when I leave. I chased me for a long distance and told me.Recently, Pudong Avenue was renovated, and the attachment was like a construction site."
1,"房比,但服不.值得一提是西餐.食物方面,人在城可以排在首位!","Fangbi, but it is worthwhile. It is worth mentioning that in terms of Western food. In terms of food, people can be ranked first in the city!"
1,酒店还算不错的，价格实惠，服务也很到位，推荐下！,"The hotel is pretty good, the price is affordable, the service is in place, it is recommended!"
1,宾馆内的环境不错，早上起来我都要逛一圈然后在去吃早饭，入住的人也很多，车场都停满了，服务也可以，总的来说不错，但是没有通过携程预订该酒店，在入住时即可享受该酒店提供的额外优惠，问总台小姐，人家说根本就没有这个，有疑问请自己去找携程问，汗！打携程的电话又总是打不通，只有算了！,"The environment in the hotel is good. I have to walk around in the morning and go to breakfast. There are many people who stay in. The parking lots are full. The service is okay.You can enjoy the additional discounts provided by the hotel when you stay in. Ask Miss Chief Taiwan, people say that there is no such a matter at all. If you have any questions, please go to Ctrip to ask, sweat!The call of Ctrip is always unreasonable, only for the case!"
1,服务态度真好，让人觉得舒服。退房时被告知有件衣服忘在房间，我想回去拿，但他们坚持让服务员去帮我拿过来。进进出出酒店的人都会对你微笑，会弯腰点头打招呼。周边的环境我本人很喜欢，小城镇的感觉。就是有几点不足，一是楼层太低，好像只有4层，我们住一楼，感觉很奇怪。二是房间的隔音不好，老是听到窗户外面的人说话。别的酒店一般都有的士在前面等着，但是这里要走到外面去打车。,"The service attitude is so good and makes people feel comfortable.When checking out, I was told that there was a dress for forgetting to be in the room. I wanted to go back to get it, but they insisted on asking the waiter to help me get it over.Those who enter and leave the hotel will smile at you, and will bend over to say hello.I like the surrounding environment. I feel like a small town.There are a few shortcomings. One is that the floor is too low, it seems that there are only 4 floors. We live on the first floor and feel strange.The second is that the sound insulation in the room is not good, always hearing the people outside the window to speak.Other hotels are usually waiting in front of them, but they have to go outside to take a taxi here."
1,"在副楼的房间有老旧了些,实有必要再整修了,尤其在地毯部份,不然整体上是不错的的.在早餐的服务上还是可以的,仍有著水准.","It is older in the room in the auxiliary building, and it is necessary to renovate, especially in the carpet part, otherwise it is good overall. It is still possible in the breakfast service, and there is still a standard."
1,非常感谢携程为我们安排的酒店我们对该酒店的服务表示满意，希望携程的服务越来越好，为携程的贵宾提供更优良、更全面的服务。,"Thank you very much for the hotel that we arranged for us. We are satisfied with the hotel's service. I hope that Ctrip's service will be better and better, and provide Ctrip's VIPs with better and more comprehensive services."
1,我第一次用携程订房，在长安酒店住得很舒适，餐饮很令人满意。价格仅比前台价格低不多，不是太有竞争优势。,"For the first time, I reached with Ctrip. I lived comfortably at the Changan Hotel, and the catering was very satisfactory.The price is not much lower than the front desk, not too competitive."
1,因工作方便，常往此酒店，交通是很大的考量。不在通巴士和永巴士都不跑一酒店，又少了一些方便。前天入住，前台注意到正好是我的生日，特安排送了一蛋糕，感很心。,"Due to convenient work, traffic is often considered in this hotel.No hotel is not running at the Tong Bus and Yongba, and it is less convenient.Checking up the day before yesterday, the front desk noticed that it was my birthday. I arranged a cake and felt very hearty."
1,酒店地理位置不错，交通非常便利，房间整体感觉还可以，只是浴室有些小。酒店提供的早餐不够丰富。酒店员工整体的服务意识不错，尤其是大堂经理，在安排订车时还特地送给我们一份当地地图，很细心周到。,"The hotel has a good geographical location, the transportation is very convenient, and the overall feeling of the room is okay, but the bathroom is small.The breakfast provided by the hotel is not rich enough.The overall service awareness of the hotel employee, especially the lobby manager, also gave us a local map when arranging the car booking, very careful and thoughtful."
1,不值房价，早餐太糟，也许我去的比较晚，九点左右，没东西吃,"Not worth the house price, the breakfast is too bad, maybe I went late, around nine o'clock, there was nothing to eat"
1,这次虽然订的是标间，但到了以后我换了刚装修好的商务单间，还稍有点装修好的气味，估计再过几天应该没有了。房间虽然不是很大，但总体感觉不错，干净、整洁，房间内少个挂衣服的地方，已经和酒店提了意见，估计能很快解决。酒店地理位置ok，到春熙路不远。总体感觉性价比不错，值得入住。,"Although I booked this time, I changed the business single room I just renovated, and I also had a little decorated odor. It is estimated that it should be gone in a few days.Although the room is not very large, it feels good overall. It is clean and tidy. There is a few places in the room hanging in the room. It has already made opinions with the hotel. It is estimated that it can be solved quickly.The geographical location of the hotel is OK, not far from Chunxi Road.The overall feeling is good cost -effective and worthy of check -in."
1,环境不错，8月18号入住，8月16号安装好了电梯，预约人员对此信息不了解，这几月出行最好的酒店了，价格偏高。,"The environment is good, staying in August 18th, the elevator was installed on August 16th. The appointment staff did not understand the information. In recent months, the best hotel for travel has been high, and the price is high."
1,宽带上网速度挺快，酒店一楼的烧烤不错。酒店整体性价比可以，去酒吧一条街打车10元,"The broadband Internet speed is quite fast, and the barbecue on the first floor of the hotel is good.The overall cost -effectiveness of the hotel is OK, take a bus 10 yuan in a bar on the bar"
1,"物超所值,此次我们是订的三个房间。感慨中西部的服务有时比发达地区好多了。宾馆反馈2008年8月8日：感谢您的入住，并期待您再次光临。","Masterpiece is worth it, this time we are the three rooms we have booked.Silent in the central and western regions is sometimes much better than developed regions.Hotel feedback on August 8, 2008: Thank you for your stay and look forward to your visit again."
1,非常不错的酒店，虽然不是在处在市中心，但是离钟楼、鼓楼不远，出租车起步价即可，或者可以坐公车606路，车站就在酒店对面。酒店环境不错，房间很干净，工作人员服务也比较好。,"The very good hotel, although not in the center of the city, is not far from the bell tower and Drum Tower. The starting price of the taxi is sufficient, or you can take the bus 606, and the station is opposite the hotel.The hotel environment is good, the room is clean, and the staff service is better."
1,协程价格比较好。下次出差还会住这里。房间还不错。,The coroutine price is better.I will live here next time.The room is not bad.
1,位置好，早餐丰富，上网很快。只是不再是万豪管理的了，希望服务水平不会下降,"The location is good, the breakfast is rich, and the Internet is fast.It's just that it is no longer managed by Marriott, I hope the service level will not decrease"
1,1、地理位置和环境不错2、早餐也还可以3、服务不错，特别是室内游泳池设施比较舒服4、房间比较陈旧了，特别是拖鞋太薄，不像个四星Hotel,"1. Good geographical location and environment. 2. Breakfast can also be good. The service is good, especially the indoor swimming pool facilities are more comfortable. 4. The room is old, especially the slippers are too thin, not like a four -star Hotel"
1,位置很好，市中心，房间可以见到半岛、江面，餐饮（旋转餐厅）非常好。宾馆反馈2008年8月7日：非常感谢您对我酒店的支持和厚爱，柳州宾馆致力打造柳州性价比最高的酒店。我宾馆按五星级标准装修的24-26楼高层观景客房即将竣工，期待您的光临！！,"The location is very good.

1,"已经是第二次入住这家酒店了,感觉上还是第一次住的面对柳江的房间景观比较好,不过这次来酒店前面的路已经修好了,交通很方便.酒店的服务员依然一如既往的微笑服务,特别推荐一下30楼的旋转餐厅,夜幕降临时分来这里用餐,看柳江两岸的景色很美.不过这家酒店不适合打长途电话,1.8元/分钟,是我住过的电话费收费最高的一家.宾馆反馈2008年8月7日：非常感谢您对我酒店的支持和厚爱，柳州宾馆致力打造柳州性价比最高的酒店。我宾馆按五星级标准装修的24-26楼高层观景客房即将竣工，期待您的光临！！","It is the second time to stay in this hotel.

However, the road in front of the hotel has been repaired this time, and the traffic is very convenient.Smile service, especially recommend the rotating restaurant on the 30th floor. The night is divided into dinner here. It is beautiful to watch the scenery on both sides of Liujiang. However, this hotel is not suitable for long -distance calls, 1.8 yuan/minute.The highest one.

Liuzhou Hotel is committed to creating the most cost -effective hotel in Liuzhou.The high-rise viewing room of the 24-26 floor of our hotel according to the five-star standard decoration is about to be completed.

1,去柳州还算不错的选择。周围挺热闹的，书店，步行街...服务很好，房间也还可以。就是卫生间太小了，还有早餐太一般了。反正去柳州算是个OK。宾馆反馈2008年7月31日：您的意见我们已向西餐厅做了反馈，自助早餐的品种已做了调整，相信能让您满意。柳州宾馆地处柳州市的商业中心，吃，住，行，游，购，娱十分便利，是您来柳州出差，旅游的首选之所！！,"It's a good choice to go to Liuzhou.The surroundings are very lively, bookstores, pedestrian streets ... the service is very good, the room is okay.The bathroom is too small, and the breakfast is too average.It's OK to go to Liuzhou anyway.Hotel feedback on July 31, 2008: Your opinion has given feedback to the Western Restaurant.

1,"我在上海几天里住的最好的一个酒店,同为四星级,整体感觉是最有品质的,订房台给的是转角的2715房,非常舒服,儿子玩得非常高兴,但酒店的服务人员态度比较冷漠,对待内外宾还是有区别的,同样拦出租车,门僮居然对我说,请让我们的客人,我回头一看是一对外国人,同住这家酒店,难道我不是客人?出于礼貌我让了,但心里很不舒服,希望携程的价格能更低点,","The best hotel I lived in Shanghai for a few days is the same four -star. The overall feeling is the most quality. The booking station gives the corner 2715 room. It is very comfortable and my son is very happy, but the hotel’sThe attitude of the service staff is relatively indifferent, and there is still a difference between the guests inside and outside. The same stops to the taxi. The door boy actually told me, please let our guests, I look back at a foreigner, staying with this hotel, is it me?It's not a guest? I gave it out of politeness, but I was very uncomfortable. I hope the price of Ctrip can be lower."
1,服务员态度等都不错，如果有定餐送餐服务就更完美了！,"The attitude of the waiter is good. If there is a meal delivery service, it will be more perfect!"
1,房间面积太大，导致小功率空调制冷制热效果差，另外床与电视相距较远，观看起来相对比较费劲。,"The area of the room is too large, resulting in a poor cooling and heat -cooling effect of low -power air -conditioning. In addition, the bed is far from the TV, and it is relatively strenuous to watch."
1,房间环境不错，前台礼貌服务也很到位，好评！,"The room environment is good, and polite service at the front desk is also in place, praise!"
1,第一次在网上定酒店，价格是428元，感觉房间比较差，以前来乌市每次都是以朋友公司的名义订房，价格很优惠，这次是自己定的，现在是淡季，我定的428元的房间朋友定只需要320元就够了......,"The first time I set up a hotel on the Internet, the price was 428 yuan, and I felt that the room was relatively poor. I used to book a house in the name of a friend company. The price was very favorable. This time it was determined by myself.A 428 -yuan room friend must only need 320 yuan ..."
1,"交通方便,去南京步行街是上选.但是餐厅的营业时间(尤其是中餐厅)有些不便,中午二点半到已经没有午餐了.要知道,这家的中餐是小有名气的.","It is convenient for transportation. It is a choice to go to Nanjing Pedestrian Street. However, the restaurant's business hours (especially Chinese restaurants) are inconvenient. There is no lunch at 2:30 noon. You know, this Chinese food is a little famous."
1,这个宾馆在沿海城市可能也就是三星级到四星级的标准，但是在酒泉这样的小城市，也算是很不错的了，当然价格也不便宜，宾馆的设施还比较新，房间也比较大，服务员也很热情，就是水平还有待进一步提高吧。总体上，在酒泉是最好的了,"This hotel may be the standard of Samsung to four -star in coastal cities, but in small cities such as Jiuquan, it is also very good. Of courseThe waiter is also very enthusiastic, that is, the level needs to be further improved.Overall, Jiuquan is the best"
1,替两个同事订的，比较满意，但觉得价格偏高，在这样的西部小城市像这样的宾馆300-350元含早比较合理。,"I booked for two colleagues, which is more satisfied, but I feel that the price is high. It is more reasonable to have 300-350 yuan in such hotels such as small cities in the west."
1,除了停车不是很方便，其他的都还不错的，服务质量也很高，市中心的环境也很吸引人，还不错的！,"In addition to parking, not very convenient, everything else is good, the service quality is also very high, the environment in the city center is also very attractive, pretty good!"
1,"房间可以,特别的套房,非常不错,就是餐厅太脏了,早餐搞得没胃口,","The room is fine, a special suite, very good, the restaurant is too dirty, and the breakfast has no appetite."
1,服务不错，服务员态度也很友善。最赞的是房间够大。。写字台的布局很好。交通也很方便，周围也很热闹，步行10分钟到中闽百汇顶楼的大排挡吃饭，很便宜。味道也不错。唯一不足就是早餐收得有点早。,"The service is good, and the waiter attitude is also very friendly.The best thing is that the room is big enough.EssenceThe layout of the writing desk is very good.The transportation is also very convenient, and it is very lively. Walking for 10 minutes to eat in the row of the top floor of Zhongminbaihui, it is very cheap.The taste is also good.The only deficiency is that breakfast is a bit early."
1,酒店的位置很方便，小套房的房间比较宽敞和舒适，住酒店停车过夜要收费40元。,The location of the hotel is very convenient. The room of the small suite is relatively spacious and comfortable. It costs 40 yuan to stay overnight to stay in the hotel.
1,"1.预定标准间，抵达后，由于没有房间，免费升级到套房。赞一个2.房间很安静3.位于郑州比较靠西的位置，如果主要在东部活动，需要考虑交通问题。免费注册网站导航宾馆索引服务说明关于携程诚聘英才代理合作广告业务联系我们Copyright1999-2008,ctrip.com.allrightsreserved.","1. Booking standard room.

1,总的来说很满意。距离市中心稍微有点儿远，房间干净，整洁。我住的大床房，面积稍小。服务很好，帮我免费洗了内衣，每天送水果（2个香蕉加2个苹果），服务员很有礼貌。缺点是早餐不丰富，1楼的餐厅价格太高。,"Generally speaking, I am very satisfied.A little far from the city center, the room is clean and clean.The big bed room I live is slightly smaller.The service is very good. I helped me wash my underwear for free. Send fruits every day (2 bananas and 2 apples). The waiter is very polite.The disadvantage is that breakfast is not rich, and the price of restaurants on the first floor is too high."
1,"总的来说,比较干净,而且地理位置很好,市区繁华地段.进出方便.","In general, it is relatively clean and the geographical location is very good."
1,房间非常大，都吓了一大跳。对面就有超市和小吃夜市，隔壁有面包房，十分方便。从客运总站出来直接乘1路公共汽车（始发站）刻刀，站名就是“少林宾馆”。坐蹦蹦车也只要2块。房内设施是不错的，但朝马路的那边也吵，朝内侧的有个停车场也吵。早饭是工厂食堂标准，所以只打4分。,"The room was very big, and it was shocked.Opposite the supermarket and snack night market, there is a bakery next door, which is very convenient.From the Passenger Terminal Station, take the knife directly by the bus (starting station). The station name is ""Shaolin Hotel"".Only 2 yuan for jumper.The facilities in the room are good, but there is no noisy over the road, and there is a parking lot on the inside.Breakfast is the factory canteen standard, so only 4 points."
1,非常不错的酒店已经多次入住,Very good hotels have been checked many times
1,管机场接送，住起来总体不错，适合一般的客人，是那种大体不会出什么问题的酒店。,"The airport is connected to the airport, and it is generally good to live. It is suitable for ordinary guests. It is the kind of hotel that does not have any problems."
1,很不错的酒店!!已经第二次入住了!!这次用了宽带!如此的快简直难以想象!!房间布置也相当不错!!服务也好!!第二次入住经理还打电话上来做个问卷调查!哈哈!!不愧是4星的啊!价格也蛮合理的!下次来的话基本就是这家了,"Very good hotel !! I have been in the second time !! This time I used broadband! Such fast is simply unimaginable !! The room layout is also quite good !! The service is good !! The second check -in manager also called the manager to make a call to do it.A questionnaire survey! Haha !! It is worthy of 4 stars! The price is quite reasonable! The next time it comes, it is basically this one"
1,每次去江门都是住这个酒店，交通比较方便，房间有点旧,"Every time I go to Jiangmen, I live in this hotel. The traffic is more convenient and the room is a bit old."
1,酒店装修有些旧，电梯都是最老式的。但房间应该重新装修过，比较大也比较干净。位置极好，离汽车总站很近，对面有新一佳也很方便。,"The hotel decoration is old, and the elevators are the oldest.But the room should be renovated again, which is relatively large and clean.The location is very good, it is very close to the auto terminal, and it is also convenient to have a new one on the opposite side."
1,很少去宜昌，听同事介绍的，性价比不错，在宜昌市算是比较好的酒店了。,I rarely go to Yichang. I listened to my colleagues. The cost performance is good. It is a better hotel in Yichang City.
1,房间很大，而且直接面对长江，景色很漂亮，不过附近好象吃饭地方少了点。,"The room is very large and faces the Yangtze River directly. The scenery is very beautiful, but it seems that there is less place to eat nearby."
1,"饭店有些旧但房间干净,住高层向北房间安静,假如下次再去大同会再住.","The hotel is a bit old but the room is clean. Living in the high -rise to the north room is quiet. If you go to Datong next time, you will live again."
1,房间干净，还有净水装置，还有浴袍。免费送的早餐也过的去。性价比不错。唯一不足就是前台结帐的时间比较长！,"The room is clean, as well as water purification devices, and bathrobes.The free breakfast is also passed.Good cost -effective.The only deficiency is the time for the front desk to check out for a long time!"
1,"还不错的酒店,地点很好,就在火车站出来.一楼有点吵,有旅行团也有来吃饭的客人,不过不影响住宿","A good hotel, the location is very good, just come out at the train station. The first floor is a bit noisy. There are tourists who come to eat, but it will not affect the accommodation."
1,房间装修不错，早餐也挺好。出入方便。推荐。,The room decoration is good and breakfast is good.Convenient in and out.recommend.
1,"酒店设施及服务质量一般,交通情况比较方便,较适合中等收入家庭旅游选择","The quality of hotel facilities and services is average, and the traffic conditions are more convenient."
1,通过携程预订，入住3天，感觉价格和房间差距较大，房间陈旧、卫生间较小、特别是电视机那叫一个破哦，估计成都的招待所都没有这样的电视机了。早餐不错，服务没有体会到。房间价格在158元/间应该差不多了。,"Through Ctrip's booking, I stayed in for 3 days. I felt that the price and the room gap were large. Old rooms, small bathrooms, and especially the TV were called a broken. It is estimated that Chengdu's hostel has no such TV.Breakfast is good, the service is not appreciated.The price of the room should be almost 158 yuan/room."
1,"听说是柳州最好的饭店了,原来是市政府的招待所.靠近一条河,景观不错.出行交通也还可以.房间没有留下什么特别深的印象,但是觉得底楼中餐厅的服务员态度特别好,勤快,亲切,吃顿饭送了好几次热毛巾.","I heard that it is the best hotel in Liuzhou. It turned out to be the hostel of the municipal government. Near a river, the landscape is good. Travel and transportation is okay. There is no particularly deep impression in the room, but I feel that the waiter in the restaurant in the bottom floor is particularly special attitude attitude.Okay, diligent, kind, I gave a hot towel several times for dinner."
1,早餐太差，全是素菜。另外礼宾部还弄丢了我一件行李，最后发现是被别人领走了，半天才找回来。其他都还可以。,"Breakfast is too bad, all vegetarian.In addition, the Li Bin department also lost my luggage, and finally found that it was led by others, and it was only half a day.Everything else is okay."
1,第一次入住这家酒店，总体感觉不错，服务员笑脸相迎，服务周到，房间干净、温馨，豪华房还配有液晶电脑可以免费上网，而且网速很快，值得推荐。下次到深圳，还住这家酒店。宾馆反馈2008年8月5日：尊敬的宾客您好！首先，非常感谢您给予我店的好评。同时，很高兴地告知您，我店的网络光纤已从原来的2兆升级到了5兆，极大地提升了网络速度，无论是商务办公还是网上冲浪都更加方便快捷。不断地提高服务水平，为宾客提供更优质服务是我们的宗旨！我们真诚地欢迎您再次光临！,"The first time I stayed in this hotel, the overall feeling was good. The waiter welcomed each other with a smile, the service was thoughtful, and the room was clean and warm. The luxury room was also equipped with LCD computers to access the Internet for free, and the Internet speed was fast, which is worth recommending.Next time I go to Shenzhen and live in this hotel.Hotel feedback on August 5, 2008: Dear guests!First of all, thank you very much for your praise to my store.At the same time, I am glad to tell you that the network fiber of our store has been upgraded from the original 2 trillion to 5 trillion, which greatly improves the network speed. Whether it is business office or online surfing, it is more convenient and fast.Constantly improving the level of service and providing guests with better services is our purpose!We sincerely welcome you to visit again!"
1,刚才提到的如家快捷酒店，应该是如家深圳火车站店，在渔民村小区内。,"The Rujia Express Hotel mentioned just now should be the Shenzhen Railway Station Store, in the fishermen village community."
1,我每次定酒店都是在网上翻点评，发现这个酒店的评价不错，而且价格也合理。除了我自己定一间房之外，给客户也定了一间。到达之后还真是不错，酒店考虑到我和客户接触方面的问题，给我升级房间。头一次遇到升级，开心呢。房间宽敞，干净，服务员热情而且送水果。就是因为地理原因，窗外风景不是很好。但是离万象城比较近，带着客户溜达，他也满高兴的。如果再去深圳，不去香港的话，还是住这里。因为忙，过了20天才来点评。去香港的话，就选择如家渔村小区店，楼下有饭店，水果店，药店，非常方便。就是有点不好找。,"Every time I set the hotel, I went online and found that the hotel's evaluation was good, and the price was reasonable.In addition to my own setting room, I also set a room for customers.It is really good after arriving. The hotel takes into account the contact with my customers and upgrade the room for me.The first time I encountered an upgrade, I was happy.The room is spacious, clean, the waiter is enthusiastic and given fruit.Because of geographical reasons, the scenery outside the window is not very good.But he is closer to Vientiane City, and he is also happy to walk with customers.If you go to Shenzhen and not to Hong Kong, you still live here.Because of busyness, I will comment after 20 days.If you go to Hong Kong, you choose Rujiayu Village Community Store. There are restaurants, fruit shops, and pharmacies downstairs, which is very convenient.It's just a bit difficult to find."
1,300多的价格入住这家佛山历史最悠久的酒店也真是值得，起码起到缅怀历史的作用，要知道它是广东第一家具有楼顶国产旋转餐厅的酒店。推荐这家酒店吃的地道，很具佛山本地特色，不管是二楼中餐还是楼顶的旋转餐厅用早茶、午饭、晚饭都可以，价格平民化，不像一些带个旋转就一定来个套餐。如果是初次来佛山，推荐入住这里。酒店服务设施难免老化，但是还过得去吧。房间10多平米，不大；附近就是佳宁娜听说那里的房间更加小；附件游览的地方是百花广场（商业广场），祖庙,"It is also worth it to stay at the oldest hotel in Foshan's oldest history. At least it plays a role in remembering history. You must know that it is the first hotel in Guangdong with a domestic rotating restaurant on the top of the building.It is recommended that this hotel's authenticity is very local. Whether it is Chinese food on the second floor or the rotating restaurant on the top of the building, it can be civilian for morning tea, lunch, and dinner. The price is not like some rotation.If you come to Foshan for the first time, I recommend staying here.The hotel service facilities are inevitable, but it is still possible.The room is more than 10 square meters, not large; nearby is Jianingna who heard that the room there is smaller; the place where the attachment tour is Baihua Plaza (commercial square), the ancestral temple"
1,旋宫酒店的性价比还是比较高的（我这次住的是235元），主要是位置实在很好，离佛山的主要景点祖庙也就500米左右，散着步就去了。离商业街也很近，周围有应记面馆、大可以等，吃饭很是方便。酒店设施虽然有点旧了，但也算整洁，门前有停车场（免费的）。给我们住的是靠近街边的房子，有一点点吵，不知道是不是对携程的都这样。走的时候给了张贵宾卡，说下次住凭卡可以打5折（也就是200元）。,"The price -performance ratio of Xuangong Hotel is still relatively high (I stayed at 235 yuan this time). The main location is really good. It is about 500 meters away from the main attraction of Foshan.It is also very close to Commercial Street. There are Ying Noodle Museums around, and you can wait. It is convenient to eat.Although the hotel facilities are a bit old, they are also tidy. There are parking lots (free) in front of the door.I lived in the house near the street. There was a little noise. I don't know if it was like this to Ctrip.When I left, I gave Zhang VIP card and said that the next time I live in the card, I can get 50 % off (that is, 200 yuan)."
1,"不错的酒店,地址不错,在市中心,酒店服务员态度很好.","Good hotel, good address, in the city center, the hotel waiter has a good attitude."
1,位置一般，服务不错，价格偏高，周围环境比较吵，晚上不容易入睡。,"The location is average, the service is good, the price is high, the surrounding environment is relatively noisy, and it is not easy to fall asleep at night."
1,"地址不错,位于民族大道,由于我们是自驾车,所以比较容易找.房间实在太小,简陋了点.一楼的餐厅很方便,我们在那吃晚饭,感觉味道不错.","The address is good. It is located on the ethnic avenue. Because we are self -driving, it is easier to find. The room is too small and simple. The restaurant on the first floor is very convenient. We eat dinner there and feel good. It feels good."
1,地理位置不错，但是设施已经非常陈旧了。其他的也还可以。看见上面有人说可以免费打长途，可我打了两个市话，结账时还收了我2元的市话费。,"The geographical location is good, but the facilities are already very old.Others are okay.Seeing someone above said that he could play for free, but I made two cities, and I also charged my 2 yuan city call fee at the checkout."
1,"10月16日入住该酒店.感觉不错哦,离汽车站和火车站的距离都不是非常远.房间很干净,空间也非常大.周边的交通环境也好.可能住的楼层比较高,也没有任何的噪音.晚上有发生热水管道出问题的小插曲,但服务态度良好,解决问题也很及时,丝毫没有影响到对酒店的好感.主要是价格非常合理.可以说对该酒店非常满意.小缺点就是硬件","Check in the hotel on October 16. It feels good, the distance from the bus station and the railway station is not very far away. The room is very clean and the space is very large.Any noise. There is an episode of the hot water pipeline problem at night, but the service attitude is good and the problem is very timely. It does not affect the favor of the hotel. The main reason is that the price is very reasonable. It can be said that the hotel is very satisfied with the hotel.The small disadvantage is the hardware"
1,这里的服务员很是不错，前些次住宿过程中给他们提出的问题都能及时纠正，赞扬一下。,The waiters here are very good. The problems I raised in the process of accommodation can be corrected in time and praise.
1,"房间设施不错,服务没问题,早餐也不错,直的住,金华没有好选择","The room facilities are good, the service is okay, the breakfast is good, live straight, Jinhua has no good choice"
1,入住金泉总体感觉不错，整洁干净，宽带上网特快，价格比较超值，附近有沃尔马的超市，交通非常便利，服务到位，下次还住。,"The general feeling of staying in Jinquan is good, clean and clean, broadband on the Internet, and the price is relatively good value. There is a Wallma supermarket nearby. The transportation is very convenient and the service is in place."
1,这个宾馆比较陈旧了，特价的房间也很一般。总体来说一般,"This hotel is old, and the special rooms are very general.Generally speaking"
1,"我住的158的房,觉得还可以,房间正对酒店大门口的马路,隔音还可以,不吵.卫生间也不是太少,就是设计不太合理,洗澡的龙头力道太大,水打在身上都疼.综合来说还可以.","The 158 room I lived in, I think it is okay. The room is facing the road at the gate of the hotel. The sound insulation is OK, not noisy. The bathroom is not too small, it is not reasonable.It hurts. Integrate, it is okay."
1,"入住很多次了都忘记点评了.现在全部补上.哈哈.酒店已经有我的常客记录了.东西忘记了在房间,即使是一个小小的手机电池,酒店也很重视,立即联系到了我.","I have forgotten the comments many times. Now I make up all. Haha. The hotel has already recorded my frequent visitor. I forgot to be in the room. Even if it is a small mobile phone battery, the hotel attaches great importance to it. I immediately contacted me."
1,"房间真的很干净,老公总是说我有洁癖,金版纳的房间卫生,我很满意!服务态度也很好,头一天下午要洗澡,刚打开淋浴没有热水,打电话给服务员,说让我们放一会儿水,热水就来了.后来,服务员两次来房间问热水的情况,第一次让我们把水多放一会儿,第二次,她进房间检查淋浴,才发现是我们自己把热水方向搞反了,总之,服务非常及时而且态度很好!酒店有个大的露天游泳池,感觉很不错,虽然没有亲自下水,但看到其他客人还是游得蛮开心的.游泳池的水很蓝,我们住了两晚就遇到一次游泳池换水,应该还是挺干净的.酒点提供免费接机的车也很不错,接我们的是西双版纳少见的桑塔那3000,非常干净,司机人也很好,我们后来就是包他的车玩了两天半,价格很公道.早餐的自助餐我觉得还不错了,五六个中式炒菜,几种西式蛋糕面包,沙拉,培根,还有牛奶,果汁,另外有米粉.印象中好象没有鸡蛋,我比较爱吃鸡蛋的,呵呵.","The room is really clean. My husband always says that I have cleanliness. The room hygiene in Jinna is very satisfied! The service attitude is also very good. I have to take a bath the afternoon. I just opened the shower without hot water.We put the water for a while, and the hot water came. Later, the waiter came to the room twice to ask the hot water. For the first time, let us put the water for a while for a while.The direction of the hot water is reversed. In short, the service is very timely and good! The hotel has a big open -air swimming pool. It feels very good. Although I do n’t personally launch the water, I still have a happy swimming water.Very blue, we lived in a swimming pool for two nights, and we should still be quite clean. The car that provided free pick -ups for wine is also very good.People are also very good. Later, we just wrapped his car for two and a half days, and the price was fair. I think the breakfast buffet is pretty good, five or six Chinese -style cooking, several Western cake bread, salad, bacon, and milk, Fruit juice, there are rice noodles. There seems to be no eggs in the impression. I prefer to eat eggs, haha."
1,很满意这次的选择。金版纳真是性价比极高。离开市中心又很近，早餐也比较丰富。别墅型的房屋让人回归自然。这个3星货真价实的,"I am very satisfied with this choice.The gold version is really cost -effective.It is very close to leave the city center, and breakfast is richer.Villa -type houses make people return to nature.This 3 -star cargo is true"
1,酒店环境很好，商务中心很热情．免费接送机服务很好．房间设施尚可，但浴室条件稍差，没有吹风机，热水也要早７：３０时以后才有．而且总说线路繁忙不能刷卡，房费要付现金，不太理解．,"The hotel environment is very good, and the business center is very enthusiastic.The free pick -up service service is very good.The room facilities are acceptable, but the bathroom conditions are slightly worse. There are no hair dryers, and hot water will only be available at 7:30 early.Moreover, it is always said that the route is busy and cannot swipe the card."
1,多年入住此酒店，主要是服务和地理位置好。但房间和设施太陈旧了，应该要重装修才行，否则性价比不高,"Mainly staying in this hotel for many years is mainly good service and geographical location.But the room and facilities are too old, and you should renovate it, otherwise the cost performance is not high"
1,不错，房间很大，设施比较完备，地理位置也很方便。电视机稍微差了一点。,"Yes, the room is large, the facilities are relatively complete, and the geographical location is very convenient.The TV is a little worse."
1,酒店大堂很大，显的很气派，服务也不错，我们是半夜将近12点到的，前台服务人员仍然很热情，速度也很快，房间设施很好，我们的窗下就是酒店的餐厅，服务员仍然提示晚上要关好窗，不知为何，难道真的那么不安全吗，我们听从了劝告....,"The hotel lobby is very large, it is very energetic, and the service is good. We are nearly 12 o'clock in the middle of the night. The front desk service staff is still very enthusiastic and the speed is very fast.Still reminding you to close the window at night, somehow, is it really so unsafe? We listened to the advice ...."
1,地理位置不错，离去机场大大巴站很近，周围吃饭很方便，有一家齐齐火锅不错，也很便宜.,The geographical location is good. It is very close to the bus from the airport. It is convenient to eat around. There is a hot pot. It is also cheap. It is also cheap.
1,可以说是金华最好的宾馆了，但不是性价比最高的。金华没有比它好的，但是同星级的不是最好，还过的去吧，价格高了点,"It can be said that Jinhua's best hotel, but it is not the highest cost -effective.Jinhua is not better than it, but the same star is not the best, let's go, the price is a bit higher"
1,优点：1房间大，也很干净。2地点不错，去那里都很方便。3服务态度好。缺点：还没有发现。,"Advantages: 1 room is large and very clean.2 The location is good, it is convenient to go there.3 The service attitude is good.Disadvantages: No discovery."
1,"这家酒店的设施真的非常不错.地理位置也方便,大堂气派.由于没有我预订的那种房型,到前台的时候,酒店给升级到高级房,总体来说,是很满意的.","The facilities of this hotel are really good. The geographical location is also convenient. The lobby is style. Because there is no kind of room type I book, when the front desk is at the front desk, the hotel is upgraded to a high -end room. Generally speaking, it is very satisfied."
1,前台的MM很不错，效率高，态度也非常好。,"The MM in the front desk is very good, high efficiency, and good attitude."
1,电视太小了，字幕都无法看清，服务人员还是很不错的。前台的MM态度都很好,"The TV is too small, the subtitles cannot be seen clearly, and the service staff is still very good.The MM attitude of the front desk is very good"
1,管理非常好！细节服务非常到位，值得推荐！感觉得到是一个老牌的酒店．,"Management is very good!The details service is very in place, it is worth recommending!Feeling is an old -fashioned hotel."
1,我选择的是大床房，（刚装修不久吧，屋里还存有一股装修的味道）；屋内设施跟单身公寓一个样，还不错。床也比较舒服，但可能是我皮肤比较小气吧，感觉床上用品有点偏硬；还有大床房跟编外房间一样，都出了安全门了：（（据服务员介绍大床房每层只有两间，另一间临街比较吵）不过幸好门口有个阳台，感觉孤立了，但还是有一个小空间。总的来说性价比还行！,"I chose a large bed room (just after the decoration, there is a taste of decoration in the room); the facilities in the house are the same as a single apartment, which is not bad.The bed is also relatively comfortable, but it may be that my skin is relatively stingy, and the bedding on the bed is a bit hard; there are a large bed room like an outside room, and there are safety doors: (According to the waiter, there are only two rooms in the large bed room., The other is more noisy) But fortunately there is a balcony at the door, it feels isolated, but there is still a small space. Generally speaking, cost -effective!"
1,"我4月23日晚入住的该酒店,前台小姐先给了我一个两幢楼之间的一个房间,很是不满意,去前台给换了一个,还可以.觉得酒店是不应该先把不好的房间先给客人的!!我是从前山坐索道上山开始游览的,带孩子和母亲,走到该酒店的位置也确实该休息了.排云亭的位置很近,风景我觉得也是最美的!也去西海大峡谷走了一段,确实美.觉得从前山上\后山下的话,住该酒店的位置刚好是一半的位置.早晨去丹霞峰看日出,要爬一个锁着的铁门,有些扫兴.看日出到现在也总觉得太阳是从西边出来的!哈哈!黄山确实不错!!补充点评2008年5月12日：我喜欢旅游.我的QQ:410073425","The hotel where I stayed in on the evening of April 23rd first gave me a room between two buildings. I was very dissatisfied. I went to the front desk for another one. I think the hotel should not be first or not.The good room is given to the guests first !! I started to visit the mountain from the front mountain in the mountains, and took the child and mother. The location of the hotel should really rest.Well! I also went to the West Sea Grand Canyon for a while, it was really beautiful. I think the location of the hotel is just half of the place. Go to Danxia Peak to watch the sunrise in the morning.Some sweeping. Seeing the sunrise until now, I always feel that the sun came out of the west! Haha! Huangshan is really good !! Supplementary comment May 12, 2008: I like travel. My QQ: 410073425"
1,选择珠江花园的原因就是方便，有电动扶梯直接到达海边，周围餐馆、食廊、商场、超市、摊位一应俱全。酒店装修一般，但还算整洁。泳池在大堂的屋顶，因此很小，不过女儿倒是喜欢。包的早餐是西式的，还算丰富。服务吗，一般,"The reason for choosing the Pearl River Garden is convenient. The escalator directly reaches the seaside. The surrounding restaurants, food galleries, shopping malls, supermarkets, and stalls are all available.The hotel decoration is average, but it is quite clean.The swimming pool is on the roof of the lobby, so it is very small, but her daughter likes it.The breakfast of the bag is western -style, which is quite rich.Do you serve, generally"
1,我是12月20几号在珠江花园酒店住了几天，感觉还不错，出门就可以到海边，不过下午饿了，酒店没有什么吃的，出去外面也都还没有营业，感觉挺不舒服的，但是此酒店在来看来还是蛮ok的，相对这个时间，价格还不错，也像前面说的房间不够大，尤其是阳台太小。不过下次我应该还会考虑入住这间酒店。补充点评2008年1月1日：不知道为什么我给的4分，跳成5分了，补充一点，这间酒店我只评4分。,"I stayed at the Pearl River Garden Hotel on December 20th for a few days. I feel pretty good. I can go to the seaside when I go out., But this hotel seems to be quite OK. Relative to this time, the price is good, and it is not large enough like the room mentioned earlier, especially the balcony is too small.But next time I should consider staying in this hotel.Supplementary comment on January 1, 2008: I don't know why I gave 4 points, jumped into 5 points, and added a little bit. I only scored 4 points in this hotel."
1,我住的是新毫华海景房唯一好处是可以看到海但房间很小很旧是很老的一家酒店下次有机会来大东海的话应该不会选择这家酒店了这家酒店唯一的优点是交通方便虽然是老酒店但卫生做的很好补充点评2007年12月24日：房间实在太小了,"I live in the only advantage of the new nahua sea view room. You can see the sea but the room is very old and old. It is very old. If you have the opportunity to come to Dadonghai, you should not choose this hotel's only advantage.It is convenient for transportation. Although it is an old hotel, the hygiene is well done. Complex comments on December 24, 2007: The room is too small"
1,酒店环境不错，比较有特点，附楼比较一般。没怎么用服务员，感觉服务中上吧。,"The hotel environment is good, more characteristic, and the attached building is more average.I do n’t use the waiter very much, I feel that the service is in the service."
1,环境很好，花园很大，服务生态度也很好，距离机场很近很方便，不错，下次考虑再次入住,"The environment is very good, the garden is very large, the service ethics is also very good, it is very convenient to the airport, good, take care of it next time"
1,"离湖州市区比较远,打车不是很方便.不过门口有公交车,班次还比较多.最好自己有车.湖景房,并不是临湖只能远眺太湖.酒店在山上,比较清静.房间送餐不收服务费,菜也比较便宜,只是做的菜比较咸,房间还不送水,只能喝热水壶烧的水.","It is far from Huzhou City, and it is not very convenient to take a taxi. However, there are buses at the door, and there are still many times. It is best to have a car. The lake view house is not overlooking Taihu Lake. The hotel is on the mountain. It is relatively quiet.The room does not charge the service fee, and the dishes are relatively cheap. The dishes are relatively salty. The room does not give water. You can only drink hot kettle boiling water."
1,贵宾楼标间装修不错，能达到三星级标准。服务也很好，晚上很安静。就是在住了两晚后第三天结账的时候网络不通，不能用信用卡，当时很是郁闷，由于没有带太多现金，还去银行去取钱来交房费。宾馆反馈2008年7月30日：尊敬的客户：您好！感谢您对金城大酒店的支持!酒店的网络不通给您带来的不便，我们向您表示歉意！有关问题已向相关部门反映！欢迎您再次入住我酒店！,"VIP building standard rooms are good and can meet Samsung standards.The service is also very good, and it is quiet at night.It was the internet when the checkout was not available on the third day after staying for two nights, and the credit card could not be used. At that time, I was very depressed. Because I did n’t bring too much cash, I went to the bank to withdraw money to pay the housing fee.Hotel feedback on July 30, 2008: Dear customer: Hello!Thank you for your support to Jincheng Hotel! The inconvenience of the hotel's network does not allow you, we apologize to you!Relevant issues have been reported to relevant departments!Welcome to stay at my hotel again!"
1,还不错，应该比较符合三星级标准，不算太贵，可能是和携程的签约价格！,"Not bad, it should be more compliant with the three -star standard, not too expensive, it may be the signing price with Ctrip!"
1,总的来说还算可以，我在15楼住着，洗澡的水压有些小。其他还可以。就是离龙门石窟有些远，17公里左右。宽带的速度不错。,"Overall, I live on the 15th floor, and the water pressure on the bath is a bit small.Others are okay.It is a bit far from Longmen Grottoes, about 17 kilometers.The speed of broadband is good."
1,酒店环境很好交通很方便附近有比较多吃东西的地方我是晚上到的12点多在附近还是可以很方便吃到东西,The hotel environment is very good. It is convenient for the nearby nearby. I can still eat things at 12 o'clock at night at night at night at night at 12 o'clock.
1,"我是初二晚上到的这家酒店,酒店环境很好,后山就是旅游区，前面是五一广场，房间设施一般，但服务很热情，还有水果送。",I arrived at this hotel on the second night of the second day. The hotel environment is very good. The Houshan is the tourist area. The front is the May 1st Plaza.
1,环境和服务都比较不错，最大的缺憾是，早上打的的时候非常不方便。往往需要等上10分钟时间,The environment and services are relatively good. The biggest regret is that it is very inconvenient to play in the morning.It often needs to wait for 10 minutes
1,真是很好，早餐也十分让我满意，有机会去那里我还会选择这个酒店,"It's really good, breakfast is very satisfied, I have the opportunity to go there, I will choose this hotel there"
1,环境优美，服务员热情大方，有一种宾至如归的感觉，下次去福州还住于山宾馆！！我到现在还忘不了那里的早餐@_@,"The environment is beautiful, the waiter is enthusiastic and generous, and there is a feeling of a guest to home. Next time I go to Fuzhou, I will stay at the mountain hotel!IntersectionI still can't forget the breakfast there@_@"
1,还算马马虎虎的的3星宾馆吗，地理位置还可以，和广场很近。可是周边环境太差，很吵。而且门口没有出租车，外出很不方便。,"Is the 3 -star hotel that is still sloppy? The geographical location is okay, which is very close to the square.But the surrounding environment is too bad and noisy.And there is no taxi at the door, and it is inconvenient to go out."
1,首先我要点评一下玄武饭店6楼的房间，实在是太差了，最多只有3星级的标准；8楼以上的房间明显是重新装修过的，要好很多；我们入住的时候一下子要了6间房间，前台有位大堂副理为我们升级到豪华房，都在12楼以上的，房间就要大很多，服务态度还不错；但是令我非常愤怒的是，酒店居然不允许我从带外卖回房间吃，真是太太太可恶了，在我据理力争下，居然还有人拿着什么酒店的管理规定给我看，难道酒店的规定不让吃饭？他们让我要么出去外面吃饭，在房间吃，只能在酒店点，这样的霸王条款，我怎么能接受，我在大堂与他们几个貌似高管的人纠缠了10多分钟，他们在一楼的餐厅给我们找了个包房让我们把外卖回来的饭在里面吃，还提醒我们不要弄脏了桌布。如果不是因为这一出的话，我想我还是蛮喜欢这个酒店。但是确实因为这个，太令我失望了！,"First of all, I want to comment on the room on the 6th floor of Xuanwu Hotel.In the room, there is a deputy manager at the front desk to upgrade to the luxury room for us. They are all above the 12th floor. The room is much larger and the service attitude is not bad.It ’s a lady to go back to the room to eat. Under my reason, I actually showed me what hotel management regulations. Do n’t you let me eat?They let me either go out to eat outside and eat in the room. I can only order in the hotel. How can I accept such a bully clause. I am entangled with some of their seemingly executives in the lobby for more than 10 minutes. They are on the first floor.The restaurant found a private room for us to eat the meal where we takeaway back, and reminded us not to stain the tablecloth.If it wasn't for this, I think I still like this hotel.But because of this, it disappointed me too!"
1,作为老宾馆，感觉环境和服务都很到位了。离地铁很近，出门就到很方便。但是按五星级饭店的性价比，南京人说这家不是很划算。我自己住感觉不错。订的市景房，床很大很柔软，特意要的靠拐角的房间，很安静。里面的内部设计也很大方舒适。电视放墙边的设计不是很好，躺床上扭脖看一会儿就吃不消了。楼下的餐饮去尝了，味道还可以，但是偏贵，早餐太贵，没去。电梯要用卡，来访的朋友说很不方便。空调很足哦。,"As an old hotel, I feel that the environment and services are in place.It is very close to the subway, it is convenient to go out.But according to the price -performance performance of five -star hotels, Nanjing people said that this house is not very cost -effective.I feel good in living by myself.The city view house is very soft and soft. The room that deliberately depends on the corner is very quiet.The internal design inside is also generous and comfortable.The design of the side of the TV wall is not very good, and you can't eat it when you twist your neck on the bed for a while.The dining downstairs was tasted. The taste is okay, but it is expensive, the breakfast is too expensive, and I did not go.The elevator needs to use a card, and the friends who visit said it was inconvenient.The air conditioner is enough."
1,服务不错啦，不过房间特别是北向房间洗手间反味，建议改进,"The service is good, but the room, especially the north -north -north -north -northern room, has a counter -taste. It is recommended to improve it."
1,"上周去住了两晚,本来想住飞,订的时候没房了,携程给推荐了这家,服务真的不错,还有水果,阎蕾小姐还亲自打电话问候,每年都去潍坊好七八次,这地就常住了.","I went to live for two nights last week. I wanted to live in flying. I did n’t have a house when I booked. Ctrip recommended this house. The service was really good. There were also fruits.Seven or eight times, this place is permanent."
1,总的来说还是不错的，除了床小点，改换大的，其他还是不错的，新装修，服务也不错！,"Generally speaking, it is good. Except for the small bed and the big, the other is still good, the new decoration, the service is also good!"
1,不错的酒店，早餐也可以，还有携程预定的话有礼品赠送，还有人问候，酒店新装潢的，都不错，还有马桶里面有玫瑰花瓣。。呵呵呵呵,"Good hotels, breakfast is also fine. If you have a booked gift, there are gifts for gifts, and some people greet them. The hotels are newly decorated. They are all good. There are rose petals in the toilet.EssenceHa ha ha ha"
1,"酒店服务特别到位,时刻为顾客着想.房间干净.下次还会入住.补充点评2008年7月2日：闫蕾小姐的服务非常好。","The hotel service is particularly in place, always thinking for customers. The room is clean. I will stay in the next time. Supplementary reviews July 2, 2008: Miss Yan Lei's service is very good."
1,"房间是新装修的,用的是浅色调,感觉很温馨,布局较合理,显的比较宽敞.酒店选用的布草很讲究,放在手里感觉到厚实,柔软.服务周到,特别是本人出差带的衣服较多,服务员可以考虑客人的实际需要,随时增加衣架.酒店的饭菜做的有特色,去过不同的楼层,都是满意而归.虽然酒店在细节上有过人之处,但如果在某些地方再改进一下,完全可以和当地的四,五星酒店媲美,如卫生间放置小挂钩可以挂","The room is newly renovated. It uses light -colored tones. It feels very warm, the layout is more reasonable, and it is relatively spacious.There are many clothes with a lot of clothes. The waiters can consider the actual needs of the guests and increase the hanger at any time. The meals of the hotel are distinctive. When you have been to different floors, you are satisfied with the details.If you improve it in some places, you can be comparable to the local four, five -star hotels. If a small hook is placed in the bathroom, you can hang it."
1,成熟型酒店，房间、服务都还不错，商务房间，配液晶屏电脑，上网速度也很快。特别是没有一般经济型酒店的隔音差的问题。位置属于市中心，去各个地方都不远。不足：一出电梯，有一股怪味，是夏天潮气？好在房间里面没有。早餐地点太挤，品种一般。总的来讲，浙江饭店还不错，房间价格稍贵。如果便宜100元，就很有竞争力了。,"Mature hotels, rooms and services are not bad. Business rooms, liquid -equipped crystal screens, and the Internet speed is also fast.In particular, there is no problem of sound insulation difference in general economy hotels.The location belongs to the city center, not far from all places.Insufficient: Once the elevator has a strange smell, is it a summer tide?Fortunately, there is no in the room.The breakfast location is too crowded and the variety is average.Generally speaking, Zhejiang Hotel is not bad, and the room price is slightly expensive.If it is 100 yuan cheaper, it will be very competitive."
1,碰上酒店做活动，加了40元给升级到行政房。房间还不错，比较新。服务员是实习生，不熟练但态度认真。前台态度也不错。不过房间有些状况。到半夜无奈要求换房，后来也同意了。总体感觉还是不错的。酒店地理位置也不错，如果价格再便宜些就完美了。,"When I met the hotel to do activities, I added 40 yuan to upgrade to the administrative house.The room is pretty good and relatively new.The waiter is an intern and is unfamiliar but serious.The front desk is also good.But there are some conditions in the room.In the middle of the night, I was helplessly asked to change the house, and I later agreed.Overall feels good.The hotel's geographical location is also good, if the price is cheaper, it will be perfect."
1,在中旅行十年首次住到服如此到位很好的酒店很仔注重主的住客提供服主管郝先生更是切感上比五星的酒店更佳力的推大家住超乎你能想像的好服人住中所有的酒店是最好的,"For the first time in China, I have lived in such a well -known hotel for the first time. The hotel, who is so good in in place, is very much focused on the Lord's residents who provide the service director, Mr. Hao, is even better than the five -star hotel.All hotels in people are the best"
1,不错的酒店，服务很好，总台主管不仅帮我们做了免费升级，还亲自带我们上房间。房间很大，也很舒服，有很大的液晶显示屏，并且有免费饮料和小点心。刚进房间不久就有服务员泡来咖啡，尤其是离开的时候，服务员还帮我们拿了些饮料路上喝，并且还准备了两份报纸。总之来说，服务意识很强，让人感觉很贴心。很满意！唯一有点美中不足的是，有一间房电视信号不是很稳定，不是很清楚，希望能加以改善。下次还会选择入住这里。,"Good hotels, the service is very good. The head of the main station not only helped us to upgrade for free, but also took us to the room in person.The room is large, very comfortable, with a large LCD display, and free drinks and snacks.Soon after entering the room, the waiter made coffee, especially when he left, the waiter also helped us take some drinks to drink, and also prepared two newspapers.In short, the service awareness is strong and people feel very intimate.very satisfied!The only thing that is a bit beautiful is that a TV signal is not very stable, not very clear, and hopes to improve.I will choose to stay here next time."
1,住的是大床房，和先前筒子们介绍的情况差不多，会免费升级一下房间，有两瓶免费的可乐送。对该酒店服务总体评价也就中规中矩四个字吧，不过，的确评到五星是有点过头了。四星差不多了。当然，性价比而言，还算可以，毕竟花的不是标准五星的价。对该店算是有意见的话，那就是实在老了点，虽然看得出花过点功夫重新装修，但偶还是不够喜欢。另外，早餐也算基本满意吧，品种数量还可以，味道soso啦。软件方面还可以，要地图有免费地图送上门，草鞋托也算有点小意思，基本功还算到位。,"I live in a large bed room, which is similar to the situation introduced by the previous tube. It will upgrade the room for free. There are two bottles of free cola.The overall evaluation of the hotel's service is four words, but the five -star is a bit overwhelming.Four stars are almost the same.Of course, cost -effectiveness is okay. After all, it is not the price of the standard five -star.If you have an opinion on the store, that is, it is really old. Although you can see that spending a little effort to renovate, I still do n’t like it.In addition, breakfast is basically satisfactory, the number of varieties is okay, the taste is soso.The software is also okay. The map has a free map to send it to the door. The straw shoes holder is a bit little, and the basic skills are in place."
1,"客人已经住了好几次了.觉得挺不错的,希望继续保持...","The guests have lived several times. I feel pretty good, I hope to keep it ..."
1,酒店在大佛寺景点对面，高速下来很容易找到。酒店贵宾楼大床房房间大，干净，窗外景色不佳。有电脑但是每天35元，可以用自己的本本免费上。自助早餐在四星酒店中算是很好的，食物种类多，而且新鲜可口。服务员的态度也很好，早餐结束时，会先来问客人，然后再撤。前台办理退房速度一般。,"The hotel is opposite to the attraction of the Great Buddha Temple, and it is easy to find at the high speed.The hotel VIP's large bed room is large, clean, and the scenery outside the window is not good.There is a computer but 35 yuan a day, you can use your own book for free.Buffet breakfast is very good in the four -star hotel, there are many types of food, and fresh and delicious.The waiter's attitude is also very good. At the end of the breakfast, you will ask the guests first, and then withdraw.The front desk is average to check out."
1,"酒店的服务员服务很规范,早餐品种丰富。紧挨路边，周边环境有点吵，很早就有大卡车鸣笛。可能是住得太高的缘故(住顶楼6楼),晚上洗澡洗到一半没有热水了,过了约1分钟才慢慢来水.这在冬天是较难忍受的.","The hotel's waiter service is very standardized, and the breakfast variety is rich.The surrounding environment was a bit noisy, and there were big truck whistles.It may be because it lives too high (living on the 6th floor of the top floor). Bathing in the evening is not hot water, and it takes about 1 minute to slowly take the water. This is more difficult to bear in winter."
1,海景不错，属于在威海最好的吧。服务也还可以，但也没留下特深刻的印象。房间内的设施还不错，只是七成新吧，跟蓝天酒店比还差些。早餐我觉得不比三十八的好多少，可是却要六十八元。房间的隔音很差，我隔壁入住了几个人，开始唱歌，后来打牌，我听得很清楚。,"The sea view is good, it belongs to the best in Weihai.The service is okay, but I did not leave a deep impression.The facilities in the room are not bad, just 70 % new, which is worse than the Blue Sky Hotel.I don't think it ’s better to breakfast than 38, but it costs 68 yuan.The sound insulation in the room was very poor. I stayed in a few people next door and started singing. Later, I played cards. I heard it clearly."
1,挺不错的，房间很敞亮，没有压抑感，看上去很干净，只是洗澡的地方有点小，不过水很大。,"It's pretty good, the room is very bright, there is no sense of depression, it looks clean, but the place where the bath is a bit small, but the water is very large."
1,酒店不错，只是电视机小了一点，下次还会入住。,"The hotel is good, but the TV is a little smaller and will stay in the next time."
1,"总体来说还不错，就是卫生间设施差了点,要什么没什么.还有就是办理会员卡好象要价太贵了.至少我所知的格林豪泰是免费办理的.","Generally speaking, it is not bad, that is, the bathroom facilities are a bit worse. There is nothing to do. Also, it seems that the price of the membership card seems to be too expensive. At least I know Green Haotai is handled free of charge."
1,"去芜湖吃外甥的喜酒,10人,订了24~26日5间标房.住前看了点评,心有余悸.不过去住了之后觉得比想象要好.在这样的城市,这个价钱住得应该还算不错的.缺点,住4楼,窗前有一大平台,窗外景色不好.我爱好摄影,有点遗憾.","Go to Wuhu to eat nephew's wedding wine, 10 people, ordered 5 monster houses for 24 to 26. I read the review before living, but I have a lot of heart.Good. Disadvantages, living on the 4th floor, there is a large platform in front of the window, the scenery outside the window is not good. I love photography, a bit regrettable."
1,就算是在上海也是非常好的酒店哦，虽然价格高，不过个人感觉对得起这个价格，这次非常遗憾，来黄山什么都没有看到，下次肯定会再来，而且下次肯定也是住北海啦！！！！,"Even in Shanghai, it is a very good hotel. Although the price is high, I feel that it is worthy of this price. This time, it is a pity that I did n’t see anything in Huangshan. I will definitely come again next time, and I will definitely live in Beihai next time!IntersectionIntersectionIntersection"
1,预定的曙光别墅间，入住后发现房间很小，好像还很潮湿，最烦心的是发现了老鼠。后来加了钱换了饭店里的标间。在饭店里用的晚餐，味道蛮好的，就是价格小贵，可毕竟是在山上呀,"In the booked dawn villa, after checking in, I found that the room was very small. It seemed to be very humid. The most annoying thing was that the mice were found.Later, I added money to change the standard room in the hotel.The dinner used in the hotel, the taste is pretty good, that is, the price is small, but after all, it is on the mountain."
1,在经历过了汤口宾馆和西海饭店的待遇后，国脉无疑是一个惊喜。房间宽敞整洁，起码能保证睡一个好觉。放在其他城市，可能国脉还够不上四星级，但如果西海饭店之流都能算四星级的话，国脉真的算是性价比超高了。地理位置也好，价钱也便宜，是此次黄山之行最满意的酒店。,"After experiencing the treatment of the Tangkou Hotel and the West Sea Hotel, Guai Mai is undoubtedly a surprise.The room is spacious and tidy, and at least it can ensure that sleeping is good.In other cities, the national pulse may not be four -star, but if the flow of the West Sea Hotel can be counted as a four -star, the national pulse is really cost -effective.The geographical location and the price are cheap. It is the most satisfactory hotel in Huangshan."
1,距拱北关口近，标准间太小，豪华大床不错，服务好早餐不好太草率了其他不,"Near Gongbei Pass, the standard room is too small, the luxurious big bed is good, the service is good, the breakfast is not good, too grass, no other"
1,"服务很好，设施也蛮不错的，但房间隔音实在太差了。宾馆反馈2007年12月28日：首先非常感谢您选择东方大酒店,也非常感谢您给我们提出了宝贵的意见,酒店近期楼顶正在加层建造西餐厅,施工初期会有一些噪音工段,同时我们对工程施工时间有明确的规定,正常休息时间内是不允许施工的;再次对您表示诚挚的歉意,东方大酒店在不久后又将会以全新的形象迎接您的再次光临!","The service is very good and the facilities are pretty good, but the room sound insulation is too bad.Hotel feedback on December 28, 2007: First of all, thank you very much for choosing the Oriental Hotel, and I also thank you very much to put forward valuable opinions. The hotel is built in the next floor of the hotel in the near future. There will be some noise segments at the beginning of the construction. At the same timeWe have clear stipulation on the construction time of the project, and the construction is not allowed during the normal break; sincere apology for you again, the Oriental Hotel will soon meet you again with a new image!"
1,"在洛阳的酒店中还是不错的,餐厅也可以,服务也不错.","It is still good in the hotel in Luoyang, the restaurant can be good, and the service is good."
1,酒店的设施是很不错的，房间大，设施新，床和被子都是很新的。洗手间也是干、湿分离。服务员态度也是很好，出入都会打招呼。就是餐厅大堂中，适合2－3人吃饭的桌子太少了。还有就是房价在衢州应该属于偏高了。,"The hotel's facilities are very good. The room is large, the facilities are new, and the beds and quilts are very new.The toilet is also separated and wet.The waiter's attitude is also very good, and they will say hello to and from.That is, there are too few tables suitable for 2-3 people to eat in the restaurant lobby.Also, house prices should be high in Luzhou."
1,态度不错，就是服务差点，其它的没什么了~~~~~~补充点评2008年4月4日：服务人员说话态度极其不好，说是携程安排的问题和他们没关系~,"The attitude is good, that is, the service is almost, nothing else ~~~~~~ Supplementary comment on April 4, 2008: The service staff spoke extremely badly, saying that the problem arranged by Ctrip has nothing to do with them ~"
1,饭店的前台非常服务周到、快速有效率，服务态度也好，有五星级水准！在这要表扬一下！,"The front desk of the hotel is very thoughtful, fast and efficient, and the service attitude is good. There are five -star level!Praise it here!"
1,酒店房间算不错，大床很舒适。晚上睡的很香，酒店环境不到四星标准，但又比三星高。地点很好，价钱适中。,"The hotel room is good, and the big bed is very comfortable.I slept very fragrant at night. The hotel environment was less than four -star standards, but higher than Samsung.The location is very good and the price is moderate."
1,"酒店的性价比很高.我特别要感谢早餐厅的服务员,8月2日早晨我吃完早餐将小包留在椅子上,很快服务员将包送到总台.很感谢!要表扬.在走廊上遇到服务员,他们总微笑地与你打招呼.总之,对大世界酒店的服务很满意!","The hotel's cost performance is very high. I would like to thank the waiter in the breakfast room. On the morning of August 2, I finished the breakfast and left the small bag on the chair. Soon the waiter sent the bag to the main station. Thank you very much! To praise, in the corridor, in the corridor.When they meet the waiter, they always say hello to you with a smile. In short, they are satisfied with the service of the Great World Hotel!"
1,很不错的酒店：服务员彬彬有礼，大方亲切。机场接机路上就办好了入住手续；再次入住时提前做好了夜床，调热了室温，号称预前服务。餐饮的质量也算好。向会员推荐！,"Very good hotel: waiter is polite, generous and kind.After receiving the airport, the check -in procedures were completed; the night bed was done in advance when I moved in again, and the room temperature was adjusted.The quality of catering is also good.Recommend to members!"
1,服务很好，按服务中心按钮，提出自己的需求，很快就有人对应。不足是：房间有些小，房子有些旧,"The service is very good. Press the service center button to put forward their own needs, and someone will correspond to it soon.The disadvantage is: the room is small, the house is a little old"
1,房间比较宽敞，大堂和5星级的差距较大。电梯的速度快，尤其到高层。,"The room is relatively spacious, and the gap between the lobby and the 5 -star.The elevator is fast, especially to high -level."
1,房间设施比较陈旧，空调声音也比较大游泳池对高级房的住客收费，而且和外面收费一样高，觉得难以接受游泳池水太深跟里面的服务员说了也没人理早餐一般,"The room facilities are relatively old, and the sound of air conditioning is also relatively large to charge guests in senior houses, and as high as outside, I feel difficult to accept the swimming pool water too deeply to the waiter inside."
1,酒店服务不错，环境也还比较好！特别是好像是48楼那个旋转餐厅满有特色，至少我觉得住这个酒店还满满意！,"The hotel service is good, and the environment is better!Especially it seems that the rotating restaurant on the 48th floor is full of characteristics, at least I think staying in this hotel is satisfied!"
1,服务还可以，房间好，888888888888888888888888,"The service is okay, the room is good, 888888888888888888888"
1,作为一家五星级的酒店，各项设施陈旧，房间面积显然没有达到五星的标准。酒店checkin的速度极慢无比。晚上11点左右到达的，等了15分钟。房价太贵，除了地段的因素比较好，实在达不到五星级的酒店水平。早餐按ctrip的价格还算可以。房间的卫生间不错，水压很大水温舒适，也非常大没有局促感。建议大家可以考虑不远的粤海。,"As a five -star hotel, various facilities are old, and the room area obviously does not meet the five -star standard.The hotel's Checkin speed is extremely slow.It arrived at around 11 pm and waited for 15 minutes.House prices are too expensive, except for the factors that are better, it does not reach the level of five -star hotels.Breakfast is okay at the price of CTRIP.The bathroom in the room is good, the water pressure is very comfortable and comfortable, and it is very not cramped.It is recommended that you consider not far from Guangdong."
1,整体上感觉还不错，下次还会住这里，忘了是在几楼的火锅了，推荐一下,"I feel pretty good as a whole, I will live here next time, I forgot to be on the hot pot on the few floors, I recommend it"
1,设施有点老化了，但毕竟是闹中取静的地方！洗漱用的东东配的挺齐全的！,"The facilities are a bit aging, but after all, it is a place where you are quiet!The stuff for washing is quite complete!"
1,总的来说还是不错的。针对国情其间的价格，还是一家性价比较比较高的酒店了。但如果没有车，不推荐住这家酒店。我们是一路问过去的。路标还算可以。定制的是园景房面对着游泳池，虽然晚到了还是下去小游了一会。感觉不错。但想要提提的是前台的服务，真的不能算是四星。评个三星也是免为其难了。checkout的时候把我晾在一边足足有20分钟，在其他客人问题全部解决完以后居然依然不理我，还是我主动再提及房号，对方居然说我没跟他们说。而我明明在十分钟前就已听到查房那边电话说明已经检查完毕。这个需要改善。,"Overall it is good.For the price of the country, it is still a relatively cost -effective hotel.But if there is no car, it is not recommended to live in this hotel.We asked the past all the way.The road signs are okay.Customized the garden view room facing the swimming pool, although it was late, I still swim for a while.It feels good.But what I want to mention is the front desk service, it really cannot be regarded as four stars.It is also difficult to comment on Samsung.When checkout, I dried me on the side for 20 minutes. After all other guest problems were solved, I still ignored me. I took the initiative to mention the room number. The other party said that I didn't tell them.And I obviously heard the inspection of the inspection in the inspection inspection ten minutes ago.This needs to be improved."
1,第二次住，在北京，398元的房间，已经很不错了。没处吃早饭，酒店早饭要100多，吃不起。单人间很小很小，光是住一两晚上还形。房间挺干净的。,"Living for the second time, in Beijing, a room of 398 yuan is already very good.There is nowhere to eat breakfast. The hotel has more than 100 breakfast and can't afford it.Single rooms are very small, and they live in shape for one or two nights alone.The room is very clean."
1,我订的是430元的大床间，房间大小和设施都不错，卫生间里仅设淋浴房很实用，是我所欣赏的。早餐也还不错，中西都能兼顾。缺点：酒店餐厅晚8点就打烊，为了催还在就餐的客人就把灯熄了一半，暗暗的让人像在酒吧里吃饭，感觉这样的服务不够四星级；酒店没有停车场，停车就在大门口那一小块豆腐干似的地方，而且对住店客人也收费，不方便驾车族；酒店给了我们两个靠近电梯间的房间，一晚上电梯上下停靠的叮当声此起彼伏，让人无法入睡。我遇到过多次酒店给携程客人安排的房间相对不理想，但愿这次不是。酒店对面以卖千张包出名的那个店家这次我因为日程紧没能去，下次一定要去尝尝。下了高速在傍晚驶过南太湖大桥，黄昏的日光和着新亮起的灯光，浸染了大桥和沿途的新城区，很漂亮。第一次去湖州虽然匆忙但留下了极好的印象，计划下次去度假，还会入住国际（希望下次电梯铃声有改进），不过在湖州消费不比上海，携程这个房价不是很有竞争力。关于近年携程的房价没有竞争力已是众口微词，携程相当于旅行社，应该可以拿到比散客好得多的价格，在这方面是否应该对众多忠实用户有所回应？,"I booked a large bed of 430 yuan. The size and facilities in the room are good. It is very practical to set up a shower room in the bathroom and I admire it.Breakfast is also good, China and the West can take care of them.Disadvantages: The hotel and restaurant closed at 8pm. In order to urge the guests who were still dining, the lights were turned off by half. The secret portrait was eaten in the bar.The small piece of tofu is like dried tofu in front of the gate, and it is also charged to the guests of the store, which is not convenient to drive the car. The hotel gave us two rooms near the elevator.Falling asleep.I have encountered the room that the hotel arranged for Ctrip guests many times is relatively unsatisfactory. I hope this time is not.Opposite the hotel, the store, who is famous for selling thousands of bags, can't go because of the schedule. I must try it next time.After the high speed drove across the South Lake Bridge in the evening, the sunlight at dusk and the bright lights were immersed in the bridge and the new city along the way, which was very beautiful.Although I hurried to Huzhou for the first time, I left an excellent impression. I plan to go to the international for my next vacation (I hope that the next elevator ringtone will be improved), but consumption in Huzhou is not compared to Shanghai.force.There is no competitiveness in Ctrip's house prices in recent years. Ctrip is equivalent to travel agencies. It should be a much better price than scattered customers. Should I respond to many loyal households in this regard?"
1,房间有点小，398元的高级间，挺干净的，在北京，算是性价比高的了，就是没有早餐。周围吃饭地方少。单人间很小，单人床靠墙放，另外一般450mm宽。毛巾，浴巾看上去很干净。,"The room is a bit small, 398 yuan senior room, very clean, in Beijing, it is cost -effective, but there is no breakfast.There are few places to eat around.Single rooms are very small, single beds are placed against the wall, and generally 450mm wide.Towels, bath towels look clean."
1,我觉得酒店很好，房间很干净，而且包括一些卫浴设施也不错，想的很周到。是个不错的酒店，价钱通过携程也还可以接受，我会推荐朋友入住的。,"I think the hotel is very good, the room is clean, and some bathroom facilities are also good, and they think very thoughtfully.It is a good hotel, and the price can be accepted through Ctrip. I recommend friends to stay."
1,5月1日小假，在湖州国际大酒店入住，感觉不错，性价比还是蛮高的，特别是处在湖州最热闹的购物区，可以领略小城市五一假期市民的过节方式，也可以静心挑选湖州的特产丝绸和毛笔，因为专卖店就在酒店隔壁。常常区游玩青山绿水，这次来了个纯购物，别有情趣。酒店的服务也不错。下次有需要还会入住。,"On May 1st, staying in the International Hotel in Huzhou, it feels good, and the cost -effective is still quite high. Especially in the most lively shopping area of Huzhou, you can appreciate the citizens of the citizens of the May 1st holiday in the small city.Huzhou's specialty silk and brushes, because the specialty store is next to the hotel.I often play green mountains and green water.The hotel's service is also good.I will stay in the next time."
1,"服务尚可,房间大小适中,但被服及设施颇为陈旧.宾馆反馈2008年1月14日：感谢您对我们服务的认可,其他方面我们也会努力.欢迎您再次光临!","The service is acceptable, the size of the room is moderate, but the service and facilities are quite old. Hotel feedback on January 14, 2008: Thank you for your recognition of our service. We will also work hard in other aspects. Welcome to come again!"
1,10月初回黑龙江的时候住了一晚，我所有的评价都是基于齐齐哈尔本地的情况做的，我觉得没办法和北京、上海等大城市的同级别酒店比较。周边环境还不错，楼下基本随时有出租车等着，附近还有商场和超市。服务很好，主动热情，雨伞忘服务台了，很主动的提醒我。没有骚扰电话。稍微有点噪音，走廊的服务台的电话声偶尔能听到。没带电脑，网络情况不知道。因为火车时间的问题，本来打算延迟一小时退房，服务台主动给延长了2个小时。中央空调也还好，不知道冬天会怎么样，淋浴热水很好。,"I lived for one night when I returned to Heilongjiang in early October. All my evaluations were based on the local situation of Qiqihar. I don't think there is no way to compare hotels in the same level in Beijing, Shanghai and other cities.The surrounding environment is not bad. Basically, there are taxis and wait for the downstairs, and there are also malls and supermarkets nearby.The service is very good, the initiative is enthusiastic, the umbrella forgot to the service desk, and actively remind me.No harassment call.A little noise, the phone call of the service desk of the corridor can occasionally hear.No computer, the network situation is not known.Because of the problem of train time, it was originally intended to delay for an hour to check out, and the service desk took the initiative to extend it for 2 hours.The central air conditioner is also okay. I don't know what will happen in winter. The shower is very hot."
1,就是隔音比较差，房间外人说话一清二楚。其他都可以，在赣州都敢有什么奢求了,"The sound insulation is relatively poor, and the outsiders of the room are talking clearly.Everything else can be, dare to have any extravagance in Ganzhou"
1,基本设施可以，服务热情。早餐一般，但有江西特色。我感到的问题在墙壁和门的隔音效果，不太好。,"Basic facilities are available, and the service is enthusiastic.Breakfast is average, but has the characteristics of Jiangxi.The problem I feel is not very good in the sound insulation effect of the walls and doors."
1,"雨夜凌晨住进这家店,感觉上很难找,住的公寓楼也较难找,房间虽拥挤但功能也算完备,感觉酒店的机场接送服务很好,虽然一路上被数次颠醒!呵呵","It was difficult to find in the rainy night in the early morning of the rainy night, and it was difficult to find the apartment building. Although the room was crowded, the function was complete. I felt that the hotel's airport shuttle service was very good, although it was awakened several times along the way!hehe"
1,酒店员工服务不错，地理位置优越，早餐也很好。但是酒店房间内部设施较为陈旧，房屋面积也较小，与新建经济性酒店相比优势不大，未体现出四星级的水准。目前周边地区正在进行拆迁建设，楼下晚上就有施工情况，好在我在屋内未听到施工声音。总体上讲，性价比一般。,"The hotel employee service is good, the geographical location is superior, and the breakfast is also good.However, the internal facilities of the hotel rooms are relatively old and the house area is small. Compared with the newly -built economic hotels, there is not much advantage, and the level of four -star level is not reflected.The surrounding area is undergoing demolition and construction, and there is construction at night downstairs. Fortunately, I did not hear the construction sound in the house.Generally speaking, the cost -effective is average."
1,"单人间的价格物超所值.早餐不错.服务也好,很人性化.呵呵,第一次碰到卫生间马桶里撒花瓣的宾馆.不过酒店的洗浴中心,美容美发都在装修中不能使用.预定时没有提到.","The price of a single room is worth it. Breakfast is good. Well service, very humane. Oh, the first time you encounter a hotel in the bathroom toilet. However, the hotel's bathing center, beauty hairdressers cannot be used in decoration.Not mentioned at the reservation."
1,服务好，结账快，门口有好出租车。最重要的，早餐真好。单人间价格合理，但标间一个人住不太合适。,"The service is good, the checkout is fast, there is a good taxi at the door.The most important thing is that breakfast is nice.The price of a single person is reasonable, but it is not appropriate to live alone."
1,仅住了一天，单人房，感觉还满意。服务不错，早餐不错，结账也很快。去不远的西关人家吃了顿晚饭，驴肉锅仔，便宜又实惠。房间稍小了一点，书桌上放了电脑稍显拥挤。,"I lived in just one day, and I felt satisfied.The service is good, the breakfast is good, and the checkout is fast.I went to the Xiguan family not far away for dinner, donkey meat pot, cheap and affordable.The room was a little smaller, and the computer was slightly crowded on the desk."
1,"在保定,应该说是最好的酒店了,那里的餐厅给酒店加分不少.","In Baoding, it should be said that it is the best hotel. The restaurant there is a lot of points to the hotel."
1,7栋的房间很不错，虽然可能比不上其他的更高级的房间。服务人员的服务质量很好，至少我来长春几次中是服务最好的。宾馆周围环境非常好，很安静。在其他的季节可能会感受到鸟语花香。晚上休息很好，没有骚扰电话。房间可以上网，速度一般。不过我们的房间网络好像有点问题，来了一个网络技术人员，但是水平一般。,"The 7 rooms are very good, although it may not be compared to other more advanced rooms.The service personnel's service quality is very good. At least I come to Changchun a few times is the best service.The environment around the hotel is very good and quiet.You may feel the flavor of birds in other seasons.The rest was very good at night and there was no harassment call.The room can access the Internet and the speed is average.However, our room network seems to have a problem. There is a network technician, but the level is average."
1,位置很好，在中山广场和卓展广场附近，有超市，但是酒店房间较小，设施老旧，有很大味道，早餐还好。,"The location is very good. Near Zhongshan Square and Zhuoshan Square, there are supermarkets, but the hotel rooms are small, the facilities are old, and it has a lot of flavor. Breakfast is okay."
1,"房间太陈旧,服务还可以,毕竟整个长春的宾馆业都不太先进","The room is too old, and the service is okay. After all, the hotel industry in Changchun is not very advanced."
1,第一次入住该酒店，总体看还不错，房间给升了级，房间感觉挺温馨的，入住,"The first time I stayed in the hotel, the overall view is not bad. The room has been promoted. The room feels very warm."
1,总体感觉充其量四星吧，根本达不到五星。尤其是二楼的西餐厅的饭菜实在做的不敢恭维，根本不像西餐，口味也有待提高，品种也少。环境有点乱哄哄，唯一的优势可能是便宜。,"Overall feels that we can measure four stars, and you can't reach five stars at all.In particular, the food on the second floor of the Western restaurant is really not complimented. It is not like Western food at all. The taste needs to be improved and there are few varieties.The environment is a bit chaotic, and the only advantage may be cheap."
1,08年4月初住过一夜。总体感觉不错，特别是对着钟山的那一面，隔壁是南京博物馆，也有许多好东西看。就是楼下什么淮扬菜的餐厅贵了点，菜也一般。还想说一句，就是来了几次南京，感觉都是那么好！补充点评2008年4月27日：记得说下缺点，就是上网要钱！作为五星级酒店，没必要那么小气吧？,"Live overnight in early April 2008.Overall feels good, especially to the side of Zhongshan, next door is the Nanjing Museum, and there are many good things to watch.That is, the restaurant restaurant downstairs is a bit expensive, and the vegetables are average.I also want to say that there are several times when Nanjing came, it feels so good!Supplementary comment on April 27, 2008: Remember to say that the disadvantage is to ask for money online!As a five -star hotel, there is no need to be so stingy?"
1,我住的是单人间，房间有点小，不过设施还是很完备的。酒店的地点比较满意，服务水平也还算不错。,"I live in a single room, and the room is a bit small, but the facilities are still complete.The hotel's location is relatively satisfactory and the service level is pretty good."
1,设施不算新，但是挺温馨的，位置很不错，卫生也好,"The facilities are not new, but it is very warm, the location is very good, and the hygiene is good"
1,这是第三次点评，纯粹是为了拿积分。没什么可以多说了，服务不错。,"This is the third comment, purely to get points.There is nothing to say, the service is good."
1,不错的酒店。一直很喜欢。但现在酒店需要改进一下：1，早餐，我住这个酒店N次了，但每次的早餐都一样，现在我连每个餐盘的位置都能记住。2，相对目前的市场，商务单间还是小了点，这个会影响后续的入住。,"Good hotel.I always like it.But now the hotel needs to be improved: 1. Breakfast, I live in this hotel N times, but each breakfast is the same. Now I can remember the location of each dinner plate.2. Relative to the current market, the business single room is still a bit small, which will affect subsequent check -in."
1,只能说非常好！性价比超级高！酒店的装潢和所处的地理位置非常的棒，附属的设施也很齐备，服务也非常的周到，忍不住改变行程多住了几天，虽然离闹市区远了一点，但中山陵的环境真是没的说！唯一的缺点就是第一天没注意开了几分钟的窗子，飞进来的蚊子多了点，酒店没好的应对措施。以后只要去南京就住这里啦！,"It can only be said to be very good!The cost -effective is super high!The decoration of the hotel and the geographical location are great, the affiliated facilities are also very complete, and the service is very thoughtful. I can't help but change the schedule for a few more days.It's really not said!The only disadvantage was that I did n’t pay attention to the window for a few minutes on the first day. There were more mosquitoes flying in, and the hotel did not respond well.As long as you go to Nanjing in the future, you will live here!"
1,服务很好，环境也不错，很舒服，餐厅也很舒服，很温馨。,"The service is very good, the environment is good, very comfortable, the restaurant is very comfortable and warm."
1,喜来登饭店确实不错，是标准的五星级饭店。由于工作原因，我经常要晚上22点入住酒店。喜来登接受客户的信用卡担保，保留房间。非常好！喜来登的位置不错，就在天府广场的北侧，绝对的市中心。旁边有个体育场。周边的购物场所较少，必须去人民广场，或者春熙路购物街。住喜来登，可以在市区转转，看看成都的景色。如果想方便出城，那么还是住南二环的凯宾斯基好了，那里靠近机场高速。喜来登是Starwood成员，可以积累分数。早餐也非常好吃。房间的环境、设备都非常好。服务态度非常好。我以后还会选择喜来登。入住喜来登之前的一天，我住在锦江宾馆。锦江宾馆的官僚风气太严重了。我列举一下锦江饭店的问题：1、不接受信用卡担保。这完全不符合五星级标准，更不符合国际标准。如果客人22点入住，怎么办？2、早餐9点30分就结束了。一般的饭店都是10点结束。3、服务员的态度差劲，好像国营企业的服务员。4、网速太慢了。我实在想不明白：为什么锦江宾馆不接受信用卡担保。这严重影响了客人的利益。建议大家抵制锦江宾馆这种不负责人的饭店。,"Sheraton Hotel is really good, it is a standard five -star hotel.Due to work, I often stay at the hotel at 22 pm.Sheraton accepts the customer's credit card guarantee and retains the room.very good!The position of Sheraton is good, just on the north side of Tianfu Square, absolutely in the city center.There is a stadium next to it.There are fewer shopping venues in the surrounding area. You must go to People's Square, or Chunxi Road Shopping Street.Living in Xilain, you can turn around in the urban area to see the scenery of Chengdu.If you want to facilitate leaving the city, then the Kobezki who lives in the South Second Ring Road is better, where the airport high -speed is near the airport.Sheraton is a member of Starwood and can accumulate scores.Breakfast is also very delicious.The environment and equipment of the room are very good.The service was great.I will choose Sheraton in the future.One day before I was in Sheraton, I lived in Jinjiang Hotel.The bureaucratic atmosphere of Jinjiang Hotel is too serious.Let me list the question of Jinjiang Hotel: 1. Do not accept credit card guarantees.This does not meet the five -star standards at all, and it does not meet international standards.What should I do if the guest enters at 22 o'clock?2. Breakfast ends at 9:30.The general restaurant ends at 10 o'clock.3. The waiter's attitude is poor, it seems to be the waiter of a state -owned enterprise.4. The network speed is too slow.I really don't understand: why does Jinjiang Hotel not accept credit card guarantee.This seriously affects the interests of guests.It is recommended that you resist restaurants like Jinjiang Hotel."
1,"春节酒店特价,当即退了""如家"",转投喜来登.高级房只有三星级标准,太小了.换了豪华间,才有点五星的样子.不知道五星的客房标准是怎么设定的.床和床上用品是""喜来登""的特色,羽绒枕还是那么舒服!!服务上,这家有点逊色,特别是行李员,我背个大包也不接接手;前台还行,换房很有效率.看在特价的份上,不计较了.要是平时价,不值的.","The Spring Festival hotel special offer, immediately retired from ""Rujia"", switched to Sheraton. Advanced houses only have three -star standards, too small. After changing the luxury room, it looks like a five -star. I don't know how the five -star guest room standard is set. The bedThe bedding on the bed is the characteristic of ""Sheraton"", and the down pillow is still so comfortable! In terms of service, this one is a bit inferior, especially the luggage staff, I do n’t take over the big bag; the front desk is okay, the change of the house is very efficient.Looking at the special offer, it is not worth it. If the normal price, it is not worth it."
1,春节期间入住，性价比高，还不错，但是不知道平时多少钱，在成都知名度高，住着比较有面子，但是房间太小了，而且显得旧，可能和当初的设计有关系，门口都是单行道不是很方便，如果价钱还是这么可人的话，下次还会选择。,"Checking in during the Spring Festival, cost -effective, good, but I do n’t know how much money is usually. It is well -known in Chengdu and has a face -to -face, but the room is too small and looks old. It may have something to do with the original design.The Tao is not very convenient. If the price is still so pleasant, you will choose next time."
1,房子还好，地理位置也还不错，但是不值得这样的价位。同样的水平，徐汇区的华亭宾馆才600多元，这里却要1000元。,"The house is okay and the geographical location is not bad, but it is not worth such a price.At the same level, Huating Hotel in Xuhui District is only more than 600 yuan, but it costs 1,000 yuan here."
1,"上网收费太贵,每天40元.交通还是很便利,离地铁站很近.","The online charging is too expensive, 40 yuan per day. The traffic is still very convenient, and it is very close to the subway station."
1,总的感觉还可以，很安静，房间也好。靠近民族村和海埂公园，晚上可以去滇池边坐坐，听听潮汐，非常的享受。唯一不好的就是晚上打车出去不方便，不过前台也有准备，可以帮你叫出租车，提前说一声就行。,"The general feeling is okay, very quiet, and the room is fine.Close to the ethnic village and Haiyu Park, you can sit next to Dianchi to listen to the tide and enjoy it very much.The only bad thing is that it is inconvenient to take a taxi at night, but there are also preparations at the front desk. You can call you a taxi for you. Just say it in advance."
1,酒店虽小，但很温馨，飞机晚点半夜12点到，在南京路下车一拐就看到了，没有想象中的难度。特别是交通特别方便，出门就是地铁，走一点就是庙街。这个价钱住在这样的地方真的太好了。以后有机会还会住。,"Although the hotel is small, it is very warm. The plane arrived at 12 o'clock in the middle of the night. I saw it when I got off at Nanjing Road.Especially the transportation is particularly convenient. Going out is the subway.It is really good to live in such a place.There will be a chance to live in the future."
1,房间挺舒适，酒店整体设计和环境都不错。前台的服务也很热情,"The room is very comfortable, and the overall design and environment of the hotel are good.The service at the front desk is also very enthusiastic"
1,在烟台红虹口大酒店旁边还有虹口宾馆，和虹口商务酒店，虹口大酒店是三个当中最好的，我入住的是虹口大酒店面海标间（400），还有两间面海商务间（430），干净、风景也不错，直面大海。美中不足的就是好像刚装修过（房间中的一袋竹炭就是证明），味道比较大。综合感觉比较满意。,"There is also Hongkou Hotel next to Honghongkou Hotel, Yantai, and Hongkou Business Hotel. The Hongkou Hotel is the best of the three of them.Between (430), clean and good scenery, facing the sea.The shortcomings are as if they have just renovated (a bag of bamboo charcoal in the room is proof), which tastes more taste.The comprehensive feel is more satisfied."
1,"门面太小,房间也小,连出租车司机都不熟悉,有待改进哦","The facade is too small, the room is small, and even the taxi driver is not familiar with it, it has to be improved"
1,"1．前台很有礼貌,对客户的合理要求能有很快的回应.2．不错的酒店.3．会向朋友推荐.","1.The front desk is very polite, and the reasonable requirements of customers can respond quickly.Good hotel.3.I will recommend to friends."
1,和同事出差北京，事先通过查询后，选择了中船宾馆，于是在携程网上订了中船宾馆5月17日-20日的两间房。当日飞机晚点了3个小时，因担心未能按预定时间入住宾馆，因此到北京后打电话给宾馆总台，请求保留房间。总台服务员热情的回复说会保留，于是心安了些。中船宾馆在月坛北街靠近三里河东路约100米向北的月坛北小街50米处，位置蛮幽静的，半夜在客房里不受外面道路人车声音的影响，适合休息。我入住的是大床间，房内总面积约4.5米3米＝13.5平方米左右，其中：卫生间约1.5米2米＝3平方米（约一张床大），睡房约2.8米3米＝8.4平方米。睡房内地板有点象木地板，有一张1.5米宽的大床、一个木衣柜、一张床头小柜，1圆桌2座椅、一张长木桌（含方凳），长木桌上配备有彩电、台灯，圆桌上配备有电烧水壶和4个杯子、茉莉花茶。房内装有可自己调节的空调。最满意的，一是房间内基本没有许多宾馆常闻到的霉味，气味是好的；二是枕头、被子、床单凳床上用品很整洁、干净，明显应该是新添置的用品。卫生间也较干净，全天有热水供应，就是隔音效果略微差点，隔壁房间客人开关卫生间的水龙头，有明显的水响声传过来。每天服务员及时清理房间，举止规范、文明。总体评价，房间作为个人休息是比较满意的。宾馆一楼总台旁边设有餐厅，每天早餐为自助餐，收费10元（可打入房费里），一般有油条、炸面饼、包子、馒头、花卷、煮鸡蛋、茶叶蛋、煎荷包蛋、粟米粥、绿豆粥、豆浆、牛奶、凉拌菜、咸菜、腐乳等菜色供应，还是蛮丰富的，比较抵值。从宾馆出门，可以很方便地打到出租车。宾馆东边不远处是著名的金融街，西边不远处是钓鱼台国宾馆，打的从月坛北街向东去西单约12元车费，我有天晚上从西单徒步走回宾馆，花了约1小时，大家若没事可以去四处转转瞧瞧，方便。宾馆周围有些小吃点、排挡等饮食摊店，吃东西十分方便，出宾馆后往北走200多米有个24小时营业的便利店，可以随时买到很多适合消费的生活用品。,"After traveling with colleagues in Beijing, after the inquiry, I chose the CSSC Hotel, so I booked two rooms from May 17th to 20th on Ctrip.On the same day, the plane was 3 hours later, and because he was worried that he could not stay at the hotel at the scheduled time, he called the hotel head station after arriving at Beijing and asked for the preserved room.The waiter's enthusiastic reply said that he would keep it, so he was more at ease.The China Shipyard Hotel is 50 meters north of Yuenan North Street, about 100 meters near Sanli Hedong Road on Yuenan North Street. The location is quite quiet. In the middle of the night, it is not affected by the sound of the roadman outside the road in the guest room. It is suitable for rest.I stay in a large bed. The total area of the room is about 4.5 meters, 3 meters = 13.5 square meters. Among them, the bathroom is about 1.5 meters 2 meters = 3 square meters (about one bed large), the bedroom is about 2.8 meters, 3 meters, 3 meters, 3 meters.= 8.4 square meters.The mainland floor of the bedroom is a bit like wooden floor, with a 1.5 -meter -wide bed, a wooden closet, a small bedside cabinet, a round table 2 seats, a long wooden table (including square stool).Lottery, table lamps, round tables are equipped with electric kettles and 4 cups, jasmine tea.The room is equipped with an air conditioner that can be adjusted by itself.The most satisfactory thing is that there are basically no mold smells in the rooms in the room. The smell is good; the second is that the pillows, quilts, and sheets and stools are very clean and clean. Obviously, it should be newly added supplies.The bathroom is also relatively clean. There is hot water supply throughout the day, that is, the sound insulation effect is slightly slightly worse. The faucet of the guests in the bathroom next door has obvious sounds of water.The waiter cleans the room in time every day, standardized and civilized.Overall evaluation, the room as a personal rest is relatively satisfactory.There is a restaurant next to the head station on the first floor of the hotel. The breakfast is buffet every day, and the fee is 10 yuan (you can enter the room fee). Generally, there are fritters, fried noodles, buns, steamed buns, flower rolls, boiled eggs, tea eggs, fried poached eggs, frying eggs, frying poly eggs, frying eggs, frying eggs.Corn porridge, mung bean porridge, soy milk, milk, cold dishes, pickles, bean curd and other dishes are still quite rich, which is more worthy.When you go out from the hotel, you can easily hit a taxi.Not far from the east side of the hotel is the famous financial street. Not far from the west is the Diaoyutai State Hotel. The fare from Yuenan North Street to the east to the west is about 12 yuan.About 1 hour, if you have nothing to do, you can go around and look at it, which is convenient.There are some snacks, gear and other food stalls around the hotel. It is very convenient to eat. After leaving the hotel, you can walk north to more than 200 meters. There is a 24 -hour convenience store. You can buy a lot of daily necessities suitable for consumption at any time."
1,第三次入住中船宾馆了，这里几乎成了自己去京的定点住宿地。房间布置朴实干净，卫生间虽然不大，但是也很清洁。很喜欢带木质扶手的楼梯，感觉走走去房间挺随意的。最近一次入住，窗帘的滑道非常光滑；卫生间的花洒出水量大，洗澡很痛快。最主要是的是房间一点异味没有，不像有的宾馆有那么潮气味。所以休息很安心。服务质量还不错，不过最后一次在入住时前台小姐有点冷淡没有一点暖色，我看墙上挂着“中央机关指定接待宾馆”但是你毕竟是一个服务行业，我们老百姓入住也该微笑服务不是。,"The third time I stayed at the China Shipyard Hotel, and it almost became a fixed place to go to Beijing.The room is simple and clean. Although the bathroom is not large, it is also very clean.I like stairs with wooden armrests very much, and I feel like walking around the room is random.The last time I stayed, the slide of the curtains was very smooth; the shower in the bathroom was large, and the bath was very happy.The main thing is that there is no odor in the room. Unlike some hotels, it is so tide.So resting is very secure.The quality of service is not bad, but the last lady at the front desk was a bit cold and not warm at the last time I checked in. I watched the ""designated reception hotel in the central government"" on the wall, but after all, you are a service industry."
1,闹中取静，交通方便，价格实惠，服务基本到位，房间设施虽稍显简陋，但值得推荐。,"Taking quietness, convenient transportation, affordable price, and basically the service. Although the room facilities are slightly simple, it is worth recommending."
1,"单人间有一点点小，但基本够用。已经有宽带上网了，但网速偏慢。南面靠里的房间比较安静，西头北面的晚上会有车辆经过的声音传过来。早上6点多有""按摩""电话过来，^_^；不想被打扰的话拔掉电话插头吧补充点评2007年7月31日：信用卡都可以用了","There is a little bit of a single room, but it is basically enough.There are already broadband access, but the speed of the Internet is slow.The room in the south is relatively quieter, and the sound of vehicles passed by the north to the north will be passed.At 6 o'clock in the morning, there are ""massage"" calls,^_^; if you do n’t want to be disturbed, unplug the phone plug.

1,酒店有南欧风：小白门，乳黄墙，铁艺壁灯，藤家具，浴室的百叶门打开可以看见阳台外的风景。风习习的吹动通往露台的白色窗帘，简直是《情书》的翻版。灯光空调都是自动感应式的，很先进。淡季去，人很少。2000余平的的温泉游泳池里几乎每什么人。泡在温泉敷着面膜也不怕吓到其他人。只是房间里有挥之不去的气味，大概也是不常有人来加之潮湿的关系吧。早餐一般。,"The hotel has southern European wind: small white door, milk yellow wall, iron wall lamp, rattan furniture, and the louvers of the bathroom to see the scenery outside the balcony.The white curtains of the blowing to the terrace are the replica of ""Love Letter"".The lights and air conditioners are automatic induction, which is very advanced.There are few people in the off -season.Almost every person in the hot spring pool of more than 2,000 flat.It is not afraid of scaring others in the hot spring to apply the mask.It's just that there is a lingering smell in the room, and it is probably not often the relationship between people.Breakfast is average."
1,整体感觉房间设施很陈旧墙面和地毯都很脏，而且有不少划痕和窟窿不过好象整个贵阳的建筑都很破旧卫生间很干净毛巾洗漱用品都很齐全电视收到的台很多而且排列比较有序有网的房间很少而且还要收费很不方便出门右手边过天桥再往右过一个拐角总共也就300米不到有一个网吧24小时的服务很周到用语规范亲切自然双手递交房卡有问题响应时间及时早餐10元还8错有粥还有热牛奶种类还算不少起码能让人吃饱,"Overall feels that the room facilities are very old walls and carpets are dirty, and there are many scratches and holes, but it seems that the whole construction of Guiyang is very dilapidated toilet.There are very few rooms with an orderly network, and it is inconvenient to charge it. It ’s inconvenient to go out and cross the overpass on the right hand and pass the corner to the right. A total of less than 300 meters, which is less than a Internet cafe. The 24 -hour service is very thoughtful.There are problems with time to respond to timely breakfast 10 yuan. There are 8 wrong porridge or hot milk types."
1,我原本想订卫兰轩或是湾景国际宾馆的，但是都没房了，所以才选了珀丽的。还好没有让我失望。我订的时候也只有豪华客房了，HKD791/天的价格在香港还算是比较便宜的了，我和JF住了两天。酒店没有那么难找，虽然在铜锣湾我们问了几个香港人，他们都不知道珀丽酒店，还好从铜锣湾地铁站的F出口出来，我就望到酒店高楼上的LOGO了，所以找酒店没有花很多功夫。不过酒店周围有很多天桥，JF着拖行李箱爬台阶可累坏了。酒店态度还可以，香港人都很有礼貌的，前台办理的速度也不慢。前台说我们去的这几天正遇上香港某展会，所以豪华客房都住满了，免费给我们升级到行政房----真是很划算！房间在30楼，风景不错，可以看到海景和山。旁边的居民楼都很高，若不是我们的房间升级到28楼以上的行政房的话，这么好的景色就都被居民楼挡住了。房间确实很小，我是大床房，房间里放了一张大床后就放不下其它东西了。不过设备较齐全，电视机是液晶的。80元的自助餐还是比较贵，而且订了就不能退的，就是不吃也是要扣钱的。如果出去吃早茶，二个人一共才八九十元。酒店位置还是可以的，闹中取静，步行到铜锣湾SOGO和时代广场所在的最热闹的商业区也不到十分钟。坐公交车、坐地铁都很方便。要提醒大家的是，酒店入住要付押金的，而且付押金不能用银联信用卡（但结账时可以用银联），只能用VISA或万事达卡。我们是用港币付的押金，住两天付了3000元的押金。总的来说还是可以的，不过跟内地的酒店相比，应该不够四星的标准，如果价格能再便宜点，下次我还会考虑选择该酒店入住的。,"I originally wanted to book Wei Lanxuan or Bay Jing International Hotel, but I had no house, so I chose Perry.Fortunately, I didn't disappoint me.I only had luxury rooms when I booked. The price of HKD791/day was relatively cheap in Hong Kong. I lived with JF for two days.The hotel is not so difficult to find. Although we asked a few Hong Kong people in Causeway Bay, they did not know the Perry Hotel. Fortunately, it was exported from the F of the Causeway Bay Subway Station.There is no effort to spend a lot of effort.However, there are many flyover around the hotel. JF is exhausted with a dragging suitcase climbing steps.The hotel attitude is okay. Hong Kong people are very polite, and the speed of the front desk is not slow.The front desk says that we have met a Hong Kong exhibition in the past few days, so the luxury rooms are full, and it is very cost-effective to upgrade us to the administrative house for free!The room is on the 30th floor. The scenery is good. You can see the sea view and mountain.The residential buildings next to each other are very high. If it is not for our room to upgrade to an administrative house above the 28th floor, such a good scenery will be blocked by the residential building.The room is really small. I am a big bed room. I ca n’t put any other things after putting a large bed in the room.However, the equipment is relatively complete, and the TV is LCD.The 80 yuan buffet is still more expensive, and it cannot be retired after ordering.If you go out to eat morning tea, the two are only 80 yuan in total.The location of the hotel is still okay. Take quiet in trouble and walk to SOGO in Causeway Bay and the most lively business district where Times Square is in less than ten minutes.It is convenient to take a bus and the subway.It should be reminded that the hotel is paying for a deposit, and the deposit cannot be paid with UnionPay credit cards (but UnionPay can be used at checkout), and can only be used with VISA or Mastercard.We paid a deposit paid by Hong Kong dollars and paid a deposit of 3,000 yuan for two days.In general, it is okay, but compared with the hotel in the Mainland, it should not be enough for four -star standards. If the price can be cheaper, next time I will consider choosing the hotel to stay."
1,"地段不错,房间虽小但干净,适合商务活动.","The location is good, although the room is small but clean, suitable for business activities."
1,标准间环境不怎么的，楼层低、有蚊子。商务间还可以，大床房1,"The standard room environment is not good, with low floors and mosquitoes.The business room is okay, the big bed room 1"
1,"对于自驾游,这家酒店很合适，我们是住2号楼顶层,风景及服务都很好，下次去威海还住这家酒店!","For self -driving tour, this hotel is very suitable. We are the top floor of Building 2, and the scenery and service are very good. Next time I go to Weihai to live in this hotel!"
1,地角-虽然打车去哪都不贵但是前不着村后不着店步行太冷了不过早上吃饭还是很方便客房很烂~似乎是后改造的跟北京的洲际没法比人家那个是闪闪发亮这个是暗淡无光还很阴冷~安排的朝北的房子朋友先洗澡结果说淋浴的下水道堵了里面全是头发恶心无比地砖也是脏渍斑驳的里面配套的毛巾什么的根本就不全浴巾和浴袍各只有一条我宁愿加点钱住别家真不知道5星是怎么得来的,"Embers-although it is not expensive to get a taxi, it is not too cold to walk before the village, but it is still very convenient to eat in the morning. It seems that the intercontinental in Beijing is not as bright as the people in Beijing.It is dark and light, and it is very cold ~ The northern friends who have been arranged to the north are bathing. As a result, the sewer of the shower is blocked. The nausea is all nauseous.There is only one I would rather add some money to live in my home. I really don’t know how 5 stars come."
1,洲际酒店，携程的价格确实有竞争力。应该是沈阳最便宜的五星级酒店。1）地理位置：位于商业街太原街附近，交通方便，但门口老是堵车，建议打车的话在酒店对面下，然后过马路。2）房间：很小，但可以看到街景的不错。3)健身中心居然不给拍照，其他同类酒店没此规定4）礼宾部门口服务不好，可能因为沈阳冬天太冷，人都不出来迎接客人。5）最糟糕的一点是：叫礼宾部打辆出租车去机场，上车前还问酒店的人是否打表收费，确认后上车，结果到了机场竟开口喊价，50元的车费司机喊100！！当时因赶飞机的原因没有追究，事后投诉洲际，到现在仍未解决。相当失望！,"In intercontinental hotels, Ctrip's price is indeed competitive.It should be the cheapest five -star hotel in Shenyang.1) Geographical location: It is located near Taiyuan Street, Commercial Street. It is convenient for transportation, but there is always a traffic jam at the door. It is recommended to take a taxi under the hotel, and then cross the road.2) Room: very small, but you can see the street view.3) The fitness center does not take pictures. Other similar hotels do not have this regulation. 4) The service at the court department is not good. It may be because Shenyang winter is too cold, and no one will come out to welcome the guests.5) The worst point is: Calling a taxi for a taxi to the airport. Before getting on the bus, the people who asked the hotel would be charged. After confirming, they got on the car.Shout 100!IntersectionAt that time, it was not investigated due to the reasons for catching an aircraft. The complaints of intercontinental afterwards have not yet been resolved.Quite disappointed!"
1,由于位置关系，一些时间不太好打到车，当然这不是酒店的错。,"Due to the location, some time is not easy to hit the car, of course, this is not the hotel's fault."
1,房间设施陈旧，屋子里全是霉味。网络收费为每分钟1元，每天100元，简直是抢。顶层餐厅非常棒，黄浦江美景尽收眼底，漂亮。。,"The room facilities are old, and the room is all moldy.The network charging is 1 yuan per minute and 100 yuan per day, which is simply grabbing.The top restaurant is very good.Essence"
1,地理位置超好，步行至外滩仅需4分钟，真不愧是黄金地段中的黄金。房间很大，很干净，对房内设施超满意，上网速度就像飞一样。晚上很安静，在寂静中欣赏窗外黄浦江的景色真是一种说不出的享受，建议第一次来上海的朋友选择江景房试试。早餐不错，丰盛，食品质量高，可选样式超多。晚餐是单点的，如果选择靠近窗户的位置用餐那真的是梦幻，比较适合家庭，情侣用餐或洽谈生意。三十一楼酒吧，是我所去过最高，景色最特别，服务最到位的酒吧，多了我不说，自己去体会就什么都知道了，两个字形容“梦幻”。酒店的总台和礼宾服务周到热情，真不愧是国际管理集团旗下的酒店。无论在哪方面的服务真的很周到细心，如果以后还有机会到上海，我很愿意再度住在这里。,"The geographical location is super good. It only takes 4 minutes to walk to the Bund. It is indeed the gold in the golden area.The room is very large and clean. It is super satisfied with the facilities in the room. The speed of the Internet is like flying.It is very quiet at night. It is really an indescribable enjoyment to enjoying the scenery of the Huangpu River outside the window. It is recommended that friends who come to Shanghai for the first time choose Jiangjingfang to try it.Breakfast is good, rich, high in food quality, and many optional styles.Dinner is single. If you choose to eat near the window, it is really dreamy. It is more suitable for families. Couples eat or negotiate business.The bar of the 31st floor is the bar I have been the highest, the most special, and the most in place. If I do n’t say more, I will know everything. The two words describe “dream”.The hotel's head station and Libin service are full of enthusiasm, which is indeed a hotel under the International Management Group.No matter which service service is really thoughtful, if I have the opportunity to go to Shanghai in the future, I am willing to live here again."
1,酒店超值，不用300元住标间，房间很干净舒服，前台服务员态度很好，酒店管理水平很高，还可免费延住到2点。,"The hotel is value -for -money. It does not need 300 yuan to live in the standard room. The room is very clean and comfortable. The front desk waiter has a good attitude. The hotel management level is very high, and it can be extended to 2 points for free."
1,因为是新客房，房间设施方面就还不错，客房服务也非常好，不过酒店服务就差一点，西餐厅的餐点也不太好，早餐还行，地理位置还不错，属于市中心的位置，只是停车不方便，下次还会考虑入住。,"Because it is a new room, the room facilities are not bad, and the guest room service is very good, but the hotel service is a bit worse. The meal of the western restaurant is not very good. The breakfast is okay.It is just inconvenient to park, and you will consider check -in next time."
1,总的来说很不错，环境很好，特别是早餐，很好，很有竞争力。我过年这几天综合比较几个四星级酒店的早餐，还是他家的最好。,"Generally speaking, the environment is very good, especially breakfast, very good and competitive.I have compared the breakfast of a few four -star hotels in the past few days, which is still the best in his family."
1,朋友前一阶段入住的。感觉很好，对这个城市的环境也有很高的评价。,"A friend moved in the previous stage.It feels good, and it also has a high evaluation of the environment of this city."
1,非常不错，服务很好，位于市中心区，交通方便，不过价格也高！,"Very good, good service, located in the city center, convenient transportation, but the price is high!"
1,房间很好，位置离地铁站很近。服务也很好。价钱公道。大厅经理，副理都很好。,"The room is very good, and the location is close to the subway station.The service is also very good.fair price.The hall manager and deputy manager are very good."
1,7月1日，2日入住酒店的豪华海景房，是看了携程的点评后预定的，直面大海，果然很不错。尤其是酒店配套的康乐设施很多，很干净的游泳池，保龄球、高尔夫练习场对住店客人打八折，酒店服务人员态度也很好，儿子特别中意这家酒店，称以后来威海还要入住。就是自助早餐品种较少。,"On July 1, the luxurious sea view room of the hotel on the 2nd was booked after watching Ctrip's review. It faced the sea, and it was really good.Especially the hotel has a lot of recreational facilities. It is very clean swimming pool. The bowling ball and golf training ground are 20 % off. The hotel service staff also has a good attitude. The son is particularly affordable to this hotel, saying that he will stay in Weihai in the future.There are few buffet breakfast varieties."
1,羽绒被子，枕头，毛巾够厚有四星的感觉，也很干净。洗澡不错。但房间装修一般。早餐不错，就是贵了。总体感觉偏贵。,"The down quilt, the pillow, the towel is thick enough, it feels clean.Bathing is good.But the room decoration is average.Breakfast is good, it is expensive.Overall feels expensive."
1,第一次住在这里儿，我针对大家的意见，特别关注了一下，感觉如下吧！1、标准间虽然有点旧但很干净，被子盖得很舒服，也很暖和，卫生间也蛮大的，因是在商业中心离很多还算很近。2、酒店服务还算可以，没有像这里说的那样，入住时，退房时也挺快的，总的来说我很满意。3、早餐也还可以，环境也不错，有点江南的感觉；菜品种品也不少，挺可口。4、可能是在市或者离火车站的距离很近，稍微有点“热闹”，来找我办事的人不方便停车，但还好这里有地下停车场。总体来说，我感觉很不错，值得推荐！！！,"I lived here for the first time, I paid special attention to everyone's opinions, and I felt as follows!1. Although the standard room is a bit old, it is very clean. The quilt is very comfortable and warm, and the bathroom is quite large, because it is quite close to many business centers.2. The hotel service is okay. It is not as fast as here, and it is very fast when checking out. In general, I am very satisfied.3. Breakfast is also okay, the environment is also good, it feels a bit in Jiangnan; there are many varieties, which are very delicious.4. It may be that the distance between the city or the train station is very close. It is a bit ""lively"". It is not convenient for people who come to work to do business, but fortunately, there is an underground parking lot here.Overall, I feel very good, worth recommending!IntersectionIntersection"
1,打开电视后有对入住客人的欢迎词在屏幕滚动，感到比较温馨。房间比较干净，卫生间设施较完备，酒店附近交通比较方便。,"After turning on the TV, the welcome words of the guests rolled on the screen and felt warm.The room is relatively clean, the bathroom facilities are more complete, and the traffic near the hotel is more convenient."
1,优点：大堂和客房部的服务非常好，很热情（因为没有冰箱特地帮我们从别出弄来了冰块）特色大床房送茶香枕、一些杂志比较有意思地理位置不错，周围有家乐福等购物广场，交通也算方便送的早餐很棒，自助餐非常丰盛，中西式都有，加菜速度很快缺点：隔音极差，晚上被隔壁的客人说话吵醒最近酒店在装修，早上6:30就开工，完全睡不着了没有小冰箱电视没有卫星频道设施如马桶、毛巾稍有陈旧，不过还行,"Advantages: The service of the lobby and the guest room department is very good, very enthusiastic (because there is no refrigerator to help us from the ice cubes from the ice cubes), the characteristic large bed rooms to send tea pillows, some magazines are more interesting and geographical, there are Carrefour, etc.Shopping squares, transportation is also convenient for breakfast, buffets are very rich, Chinese and Western style, fast disadvantages: poor sound insulation, wake up by guests next door to wake up. Recently, the hotel is renovating.Starting, I ca n’t sleep at all. There are no small refrigerators. There are no satellite channel facilities such as toilets and towels."
1,"偶住的是特色大床房,是第二次入住这家店了.要表扬一下,有了不少改进,看得出酒店还是很用心在经营的.特色大床房里有免费的书籍,靠,有7\8种,还放了一枕茶园的茶香枕,女朋友很喜欢,味道很好闻,还有免费的碟片和DVD租借,只要押200大洋,有不少大片可以挑.总台的MM服务很热情,人也漂亮,登记的时候问晚上有什么地方好逛,马上介绍了东林广场,夜景确实挺美,旁边的家乐福超市和保利广场可以SHOPPING,帮女朋友买了条裙子,顺便搞了点夜宵,嘿嘿,这个夜晚不错.","Occasionally, I live in a big bedroom, which is the second time I stayed in this store. To praise, there have been many improvements, and I can see that the hotel is still in business. There are free books in the characteristic big bedrooms.Damn, there are 7 \ 8 types, and a tea pillow of a tea garden is also placed. The girlfriend likes it very much, the taste is very good, and there are free discs and DVD rental.The MM service of the main station is very enthusiastic and people are beautiful. When registering, ask where there is any place to visit at night. I immediately introduced Donglin Plaza. The night scene is really beautiful. The Carrefour Supermarket and Poly Plaza next to it can be taken.I had a skirt, and I had some supper by the way, hey, this night is good."
1,设施陈旧，感觉不想05年装修过的样子。卫生间也较一般。不过三星也就这样了。床太短，我不算很高吧。稍微往下躺了些脚居然悬空在床外。床头柜有个小收音机很有特色，商务房有电脑，网速也很不错。我住的是靠角落的房间感觉噪音不算很大。,"The facilities are old and do not want to be decorated in 2005.The bathroom is also average.But Samsung is the same.The bed is too short, I am not very high.Lying down a little down, he hung outside the bed.The bedside table has a small radio very distinctive, the business house has a computer, and the network speed is also very good.I live in the corner room that I feel that the noise is not great."
1,"1号刚去过.酒店很旧海景别墅是木板地很响,白天房间很晒空调又不太制冷.到处是蚊子.餐厅好难吃.服务员太度很好.看海很美,离海很进就是沙滩很不好太脏比三亚差太多","I just visited No. 1. The hotel is very old sea view villas are wooden plates. The room is very sunny during the day and is not very refrigerated. Mosquitoes are everywhere. The restaurant is so good. The waiter is too good. It is beautiful to see the sea.Entry is that the beach is not good, too dirty than Sanya"
1,我住的是复试海景套房，阳台就可以看见大海，晚上躺在床上耳边就有海浪声，感觉不错，服务员态度很好，缺点就是这里交通不方便，出门的话需要前台叫车，酒店设施就一般了,I live in the re -test seascape suite. You can see the sea in the balcony. There is a wave of waves in the bed at night. It feels good. The waiter attitude is very good. The disadvantage is that the traffic here is inconvenient.Average
1,房间虽小，但很干净的！有点家的感觉，以后还会住！,"Although the room is small, it is very clean!I feel a bit home, I will live in the future!"
1,订的商务大床房，整体还可以，里面设施虽简单但比较人性化；酒店服务人员态度很好，很热情，就是早餐不是很好吃的。,"The large -scale business bed room is okay as a whole. Although the facilities are simple but more humane; the hotel service staff attitude is very good and enthusiastic, that is, breakfast is not delicious."
1,目前为止，是我第一家还想下次去的酒店。无论是环境还是服务，都能让我感受到5星级的服务，尽管我去的时候是春节，一部分餐饮关闭，但是服务生快速的应答到位的服务还是让人感到贴心。,"So far, it is my first hotel I want to go next time.Whether it is the environment or service, I can feel the 5 -star service. Although I am going to the Spring Festival, some catering is closed, but the waiter's quickly responding to the service is still intimate."
1,我是自己开车去的酒店，这个酒店如果是晚上入住根本看不到酒店入口处，我费尽周折边打电话咨询酒店边让车上的人仔细辨认，结果还是绕错很多地方好不容易才开到酒店大门口，那天正好下小雨，门口保安只有一人跑来，我在酒店门口依然看不到车库入口，要求保安带路，于是他安排一个管理车库的工人引路，那工人带我们到车库后一听说我们是入住客人不能向他交停车费，他立刻一溜烟不见人影，害得我们找电梯口回酒店找了半天！！！这种情况也许以前很难体现出来也许平时也不觉得怎样过分，但这几件事集中起来就反映了该酒店的管理薄弱的一方面，最重要的是我觉得作为一个好评如潮的酒店更不应该了！当然事后当晚值班经理的及时道歉和升级房间等等补偿行为也体现了该酒店管理层对客人的重视，体现了酒店有错及时改进的诚恳态度！而且第二天还通过携程要向我电话道歉！我也确实感到该酒店能有如此态度很难能可贵了！本来我不想点评此次事情，但后来觉得也不妨通过我的客观褒贬让大家看到该酒店的真实品质！也许我下次还会考虑入住该酒店，只是仍然希望酒店今后多积极发现不足，免得以后入住该酒店的客人那么麻烦同时也影响自己的声誉！,"I am a hotel where I drive. If this hotel is not at the entrance of the hotel at all at night, I will make every time I call to consult the hotel to let the people on the car carefully identify.When I arrived at the entrance of the hotel, it happened to be raining that day. Only one person at the door of the door came. I still couldn't see the entrance of the garage at the entrance of the hotel and asked the security guard to bring the road. ThereforeI heard that we were not allowed to pay a parking fee to him. He immediately did not see the shame, which made us find the elevator port back to the hotel for a long time!IntersectionIntersectionThis situation may be difficult to reflect in the past may not feel too much, but these things are concentrated reflecting the weak aspect of the hotel's management. The most important thing is that I think as a well -known hotel.It shouldn't be!Of course, compensation for the timely apology and upgrading of the room of the duty manager after the evening also reflects the attention of the hotel management to the guests, and reflects the sincere attitude of the hotel's wrong time to improve!And the next day, I would call me to apologize to me the next day!I really feel that the hotel can have such an attitude is valuable!I didn't want to comment on the incident, but later I felt that I might as well let everyone see the real quality of the hotel through my objective praise!Maybe I will consider staying at the hotel next time, but I still hope that the hotel will actively find out in the future. It will not be troublesome to stay in the hotel in the future and affect their reputation!"
1,"环境服务都不错,除了价格贵,其他的没什么可挑剔的了","The environmental services are good, except for the expensive price, there are nothing to be discerning."
1,酒店房间算不错，大床很舒适。晚上睡的很香，但房间提供的电脑不能用，大堂环境不到四星标准，但又比三星高一点。补充点评2008年7月20日：酒店房间算不错，大床很舒适。晚上睡的很香，但房间提供的电脑不能用，酒店环境不到四星标准，但又比三星高一点。,"The hotel room is good, and the big bed is very comfortable.I slept very fragrant at night, but the computers provided by the room cannot be used. The lobby environment is less than four -star standard, but a little higher than Samsung.Supplementary comment on July 20, 2008: The hotel room is good, and the big bed is very comfortable.I slept very fragrant at night, but the computer provided by the room cannot be used. The hotel environment is less than four -star standard, but a little higher than Samsung."
1,首先是服务很好，南方的服务水准普遍比北方高，让人宾至如归的感觉，电梯口有个小妹询问去的楼层，以为是电梯迎宾，可接着推荐去娱乐楼层，这给住客不好的印象。硬件很普通，也就三星水准。早餐很一般，携程30元也没有特别便宜。,"The first is that the service is very good. The service level of the south is generally higher than that of the north. It makes people feel like a home. There is a little girl asking the floor of the elevator. I think it is an elevator welcome.Good impression.The hardware is very ordinary, which is the Samsung level.Breakfast is very average, and Ctrip 30 yuan is not particularly cheap."
1,"我住过南京所有的五星酒店,选来选去还是这家(曾经的香格里拉).无论是硬件设施还是服务,都很无可挑剔...如果说缺点,就是房价很贵了,呵呵,但愿携程能谈下更优惠的房价啊.",May Ctrip be able to talk about more favorable housing prices.
1,交通相当便利，既是优点也是缺点，住在十几楼还是有点吵。其它的都还可以吧，四星级嘛。,"The transportation is quite convenient, which is both advantages and disadvantages, and it is still a bit noisy to live on the dozen floors.Everything else is okay, four -star."
1,房间很小，有点像招待所.............四星...............,"The room is very small, a bit like a guest house ........... Four stars ..............."
1,酒店所处位置不错，只是搭乘德士比较不便，早餐品种虽然不多，但相当实惠可口。补充点评2008年1月3日：酒店服务态度热情周到，入住时，由于没有本人所预定的房型，酒店主动免费给予升级，火车站就在咫尺之遥，周围商店餐馆林立，十分方便，下次到徐州公干还会再次入住。,"The hotel is in a good location, but it is inconvenient to take Delta. Although there are not many breakfast varieties, it is quite affordable.Supplementary comment on January 3, 2008: The hotel service attitude is enthusiastic and thoughtful. During the stay, because there is no room type that I have booked, the hotel actively upgrades freely. The railway station is at hand.Gonggan will stay again in Xuzhou."
1,我喜欢这个酒店，因为那里有笑容！因为方便！因为价格合理！还有登州路56号的青岛啤酒！到芜湖，经常因为仓促而订不到国信。一大憾事！,"I like this hotel because there is a smile there!Because it is convenient!Because the price is reasonable!There is also Qingdao Beer at No. 56 Dengzhou Road!In Wuhu, Guoxin often cannot be ordered because of hasty.A big regret!"
1,"技术区里唯一的四星级酒店,外观不起眼,但服务感觉很不错,尤其","The only four -star hotel in the technology zone, the appearance is inconspicuous, but the service feels very good, especially"
1,"这是物有所值的三星级酒店,设施齐全包括洗浴间小毛巾/吹风机等,房屋装修新.服务态度好如前台微笑服务好.位于市中心但是临街道而喧闹,房间隔音效果不好.早餐一般.补充点评2007年9月4日：房屋价格适中,但是协程预定没有价格优势,该酒店前台价格与协程一样.","This is a three -star hotel with a valuable thing. The facilities are all included in the bathroom towel/hair dryer. The house decoration is new. The service attitude is as good as the front desk with a good smile service.. Breakfast is average. Supplementary reviews September 4, 2007: The price of the house is moderate, but the coroutine is scheduled to have a price advantage. The price of the hotel's front desk is the same as the coroutine."
1,可能是住的时间很长，有一个月，所以服务还是很不错的，住在15楼，晚上还是比较安静的，虽然是临街的房间，早餐没有太大的变化。,"It may be long time to live, one month, so the service is still very good. Living on the 15th floor, it is still quiet at night. Although it is a street room, breakfast has not changed much."
1,房间设施陈旧，沙发大概是50年代的，卫生间很小。早餐种类挺多，旋转餐厅不错，交通方便。,"The room facilities are old. The sofa is about the 1950s, and the bathroom is very small.There are many types of breakfast, the rotating restaurant is good, and the traffic is convenient."
1,房间里有电脑，虽然房间的条件略显简陋，但环境、服务还有饭菜都还是很不错的。如果下次去无锡，我还是会选择这里的。,"There are computers in the room. Although the conditions of the room are slightly humble, the environment, service and food are still very good.If you go to Wuxi next time, I will still choose here."
1,房间整洁，有电脑可以打游戏和上网:-)空调声音有点大，此外一切都好。室内所有收费项目上面都有价签，很公道!我的手机充电器插头制式不一样，房间服务先后送来充电器和装换器，很有效率。自助早餐也不错的。就是临近苏锡路老城区，周边有点乱。,"The room is clean, and there are computers to play games and Internet :-) The sound of air-conditioning is a bit loud, in addition, everything is good.All the toll items indoors are available on the price, which is fair! My mobile phone charger plug -in system is different. The room service has been sent to the charger and a replacement, which is very efficient.Buffet breakfast is also good.It is approaching the old town of Suxixi Road, and the surroundings are a bit messy."
1,宾馆本身还是很不错的，餐厅的服务相当到位，就是宾馆位置不太好，周围不太好,The hotel itself is still very good. The service of the restaurant is quite in place.
1,上个周末去无锡，看了诸位网友的推荐，住的友谊，总体感觉不错。总体情况基本上前面的网友们都说到了，酒店的周边环境一般，当然和风景区不能比，也不能算嘈杂，一般的市区非繁华地段大抵如此。好在酒店弯在里面，所以基本上没什么影响。酒店边上有可的便利，稍远一点有乐购，交通也很方便。房间床比较硬，卫生间比较小，电脑病毒比较厉害，不过总体来说瑕不掩瑜。我们住的2号楼商务房，房间大而且干净，卫生间也很干净。酒店的服务态度非常好，check-in和check-out的速度也很快，特别值得一提的是中餐厅的菜很不错，至少很对我们的胃口，听边上的一位当地人说这边的无锡菜很地道。是一家性价比很高的酒店。,"I went to Wuxi last weekend and read the recommendations of all netizens. The friendship I lived in generally felt good.The overall situation basically said that the surrounding environment of the hotel is average. Of course, it is not comparable to the scenic area, nor can it be regarded as noisy. Generally, this is probably the same.Fortunately, the hotel is curved inside, so it basically has no effect.There are conveniences on the side of the hotel, there are a little bit farther, and the transportation is also very convenient.The room bed is relatively hard, the bathroom is relatively small, and the computer virus is relatively powerful, but in general, the flaws are not covered.We lived in Building 2 business house, the room was large and clean, and the bathroom was very clean.The hotel's service attitude is very good. The speed of Check-in and Check-out is also very fast. It is particularly worth mentioning that the Chinese restaurant's dishes are very good, at least for our appetite.The side Wuxi cuisine is authentic.It is a cost -effective hotel."
1,"服务:整体勉强有4星级水平问题:硬件水平偏低,房间隔音效果差,门薄墙薄,结账时间偏长,早餐质量偏低,不过在该地段,也没有比这家更好地宾馆供选择.","Service: The overall problem of barely has 4 -star level: the hardware level is low, the room's sound insulation effect is poor, the door thin wall, the checkout time is long, and the quality of the breakfast is low, but in this area, there is no better place in this hotel.for selection."
1,"游泳池在装修，没有事先通知，这点很不好,否则我就不订了","The swimming pool is renovating and not notified in advance. This is very bad, otherwise I will not order"
1,很好的酒店，为我司尊贵客户预订，周末入住行政楼层，28楼行政楼层落地窗户，朝南房间视野很好，可以俯瞰延安西路高架，由于是顶层，高架的隔音也很好！硬件设施很好，符合四星级标准！美中不足是行政楼层房间有些狭小，空间略显不足！另外，还有一点就是隔音不是很好，我们入住的客户有严重失眠，常被门外的脚步声和喧哗声惊醒！有待改进！总之非常值得推荐入住！,"A good hotel, booking for our noble customers, staying in the administrative floor on the weekend, the on -site window on the 28th floor, the vision of the south room is very good, and you can overlook the elevated of Yan'an West Road. Because it is the top floor, the sound insulation is also very good!The hardware facilities are very good, which meets the four -star standard!The disadvantage of the United States and China is a small room in the administrative floor, and the space is slightly insufficient!In addition, there is another point that the sound insulation is not very good. The customers we stay in are seriously insomnia and are often awakened by footsteps and noise outside the door!Room for improvement!In short, it is very worthy of recommending check -in!"
1,不错的酒店，早餐也好，客房比较舒适，还是比较满意的一次预订宾馆反馈2008年8月8日：感谢您对本酒店的支持！我们将一如既往地保持5星级的餐饮和服务标准，欢迎您再次下榻，衷心祝您身体健康，工作顺利!,"Good hotel, breakfast, the guest room is more comfortable, or a more satisfying hotel reservation hotel feedback on August 8, 2008: Thank you for your support to this hotel!We will continue to maintain a 5 -star catering and service standard.

1,"周末经携程推荐订了该酒店,从无锡火车站打的起步价就到了,貌似酒店就在无锡市中心,地理位置绝对是赞!车上听司机说原来就是以前的无锡喜来登酒店,想来应该不错.登记入住一切顺利,速度很快.前台的MM感觉也是训练有素.大堂虽然不大但是感觉挺温馨,房间非常干净整洁,中归中矩的5星级摆设,看的出日常的保养还是做的不错现在周末酒店搞活动,500多的价格还送了两个早餐,感觉还是物超所值的,下次周末再来无锡,这家酒店决定是不二选择!宾馆反馈2008年8月8日：感谢您对本酒店的支持！最近酒店有新的客房周末促销推出，我们将一如既往地保持5星级的服务标准，欢迎您再次下榻，衷心祝您身体健康，工作顺利!","The hotel is recommended by Ctrip recommended on the weekend. The starting price of the Wuxi Railway Station has arrived. It seems that the hotel is in the center of Wuxi City. The geographical location is definitely praise! Listening to the driver on the car said that it was the former Wuxi Xilandeng Hotel. It should be good to come. It should be good. Register to stay at all smoothly, and the speed is very fast. The MM at the front desk feels well -trained. Although the lobby is not large, it feels very warm, the room is very clean and tidy, and the 5 -star furnishings in the middle of the middle.Good to do well now, the hotel is engaged in activities on the weekend, and the price of more than 500 also gave two breakfast. It feels worthwhile. Next weekend will come again in Wuxi. This hotel decides to be the best choice!

1,虽然换了招牌，基本属于换汤不换药．下次应该不会再住了，性价比一般般啦宾馆反馈2008年8月8日：感谢您对本酒店的支持！最近酒店有新的客房周末促销推出，我们将一如既往地保持5星级的服务标准，欢迎您再次下榻，衷心祝您身体健康，工作顺利!,"Although changing the signboard, it basically belongs to the soup and does not change the medicine.It should not be lived again next time, cost -effective, the hotel feedback on August 8, 2008: Thank you for your support to this hotel!Recently, the hotel has a new guest room promotion on weekend promotion.

1,处于无锡商业街附近，离火车站很近。非常方便。附近的美食店也可步行到达。很方便。房间中规中矩，纯木色装修，很舒服。绿色地毯个人不喜欢，不过也是很多星级酒店的首选。通过携程预定，可以免费上网（50元/天）比较惊喜。另有二个饮料赠送。开心。洗浴小包装味道很好。很喜欢。拖鞋也很漂亮。服务好，行动快。最有意思的是，进门的灯是找不到开关的，打电话询问，回答说，那个灯是应急灯，是关不了的。只能用总电源开关关掉，如果您一定要关闭的话，我们可以让工程部去帮您把灯泡卸下来。可爱死了。笑坏我了。大堂比较小。不过电梯很快。早餐品种还可以，中日西式，日式的味噌汤竟然还可以自己加料，很喜欢。不知不觉写了这么多，总之一句评价：中规中矩，五星标准。位置便利，商务可选。宾馆反馈2008年8月8日：感谢您对本酒店的支持！最近酒店有新的客房周末促销推出，我们将一如既往地保持5星级的服务标准，欢迎您再次下榻，衷心祝您身体健康，工作顺利!,"It is near Wuxi Commercial Street and is very close to the railway station.Very convenient.Nearby food shops can also be reached.very convenient.The room is quite satisfactory, and the pure wood is decorated, which is very comfortable.Green carpet personally does not like it, but it is also the first choice for many star hotels.Through Ctrip's reservation, you can access the Internet for free (50 yuan/day).There are two other beverages gifts.happy.Bathing small packaging tastes good.like very much.Slippers are also beautiful.Good service and fast action.The most interesting thing is that the lights entering the door cannot be found. Calling and asking, answering that the light is an emergency light, which cannot be turned on.You can only use the total power switch. If you must turn off, we can let the engineering department help you unload the bulb.That's so cute.I smiled me.The lobby is relatively small.But the elevator is fast.Breakfast varieties are okay. Sino -Japanese and Western style, Japanese -style miso soup can still be added by itself, I like it very much.I have written so much unknowingly.It is convenient to location and is available in business.Hotel feedback on August 8, 2008: Thank you for your support to this hotel!Recently, the hotel has a new guest room promotion on weekend promotion. We will continue to maintain a 5 -star service standard. Welcome to stay again. I sincerely wish you good health and work smoothly!"
1,因为之前查看了携程的点评，所以对这家酒店的期望值并不高。但入住以后总体来说感觉还可以，虽说照五星级还有差距，但在吉林应该可以接受。酒店周围好像没什么合适的饭店，最后还是在酒店吃了巴西烤肉自助，比其他地方贵些88元/位，水平一般。还有一个就是卫生间确实小。,"Because I checked the reviews of Ctrip before, the expectations of this hotel were not high.However, after staying, it feels okay. Although there is still a gap in the five -star, it should be acceptable in Jilin.There seems to be no suitable restaurant around the hotel. Finally, I ate Brazilian barbecue buffet at the hotel, which is 88 yuan/person more expensive than other places.Another is that the bathroom is really small."
1,比较老的饭店，房间等设施也比较老，服务还是可以的,"The older restaurants, rooms and other facilities are relatively old, and the service is okay"
1,酒店位置、房间都很不错，价格也比较合适，推荐大家去住,"The hotel location and room are very good, and the price is more appropriate. It is recommended that everyone live"
1,酒店的位置很好，刚重新装修过，所以设施还过得去，我订的房型里面还有电脑，网速不错。只是浴缸里放的垫子竟然还有黑印，让人感觉很不好。早餐很丰富，不过好像重庆的酒店早餐都很雷同。总体感觉不错！,"The location of the hotel is very good. I have just renovated, so the facilities are still available. There are computers in the room type I ordered, and the network speed is good.It's just that the cushion in the bathtub is still black, which makes people feel bad.Breakfast is rich, but it seems that the hotel's hotel breakfast is very similar.It feels good overall!"
1,我和家人于5月7日开始入住天府阳光酒店，虽然有一点小误会，但通过携程的沟通很快的得到了解决，对于酒店积极的态度和后来细致入微的服务深感满意。值得一提的是，5月12日地震当天酒店的应急措施及对客人的负责，点点滴滴感受到酒店的温暖。有机会一定要再次入住此酒店，并推荐所有的朋友入住此酒店！,"My family and I started staying at Tianfu Sunshine Hotel on May 7. Although there were a little misunderstanding, it was quickly resolved through Ctrip's communication. I was very satisfied with the hotel's positive attitude and later meticulous services.It is worth mentioning that the hotel's emergency measures on the day of the earthquake and the responsibility of the guests felt the warmth of the hotel.If you have a chance, you must stay in this hotel again and recommend all friends to stay in this hotel!"
1,去年10月去九寨沟时住过，感觉很好！今年再和同事去，觉得服务差了。宾馆反馈2008年5月27日：希望客人对我们的服务提出宝贵的意见和建议，做的不够好的地方，我们很乐意接受客人的批评,"I lived when I went to Jiuzhaigou last October and felt very good!This year, I went with colleagues and felt that the service was poor.Hotel feedback on May 27, 2008: I hope the guests put forward valuable opinions and suggestions on our services. If we do not do well, we are happy to accept the criticism of the guests"
1,天府阳光的价格比较合理。硬件也不错。服务员态度都很好我入住的时候，大堂在装修。这家饭店是涉外的，很多外边缺点在于：早餐比较简陋，不是很好吃,"The price of Tianfu Sunshine is more reasonable.Hardware is also good.When the waiter is very good, when I check in, the lobby is renovating.This restaurant is foreign -related. Many of the disadvantages outside are: breakfast is relatively simple, not delicious"
1,总的来说还可以.几点不足：1）卫生间有臭味；2）打的不方便，要走过桥到大街上招呼3）中餐厅菜偏贵,"In general, it is okay. What time is short: 1) the bathroom has odor; 2) It is inconvenient to fight, and you have to walk across the bridge to the streets to say hello 3) Chinese restaurant dishes are expensive"
1,酒店住宿环境不错，前台服务很热情，房间可以看到长江和葛洲坝，就是卫生间的淋浴设施不太好用，总体而言还是不错的地方！,"The hotel accommodation environment is good, and the front desk service is very enthusiastic. The room can see the Yangtze River and Gezhouba, that is, the bathroom shower facilities are not easy to use. Generally speaking, it is still good!"
1,有停车场，房间干净、安静，各方面还算不错只是价格在肇庆来说还是偏高了些。上次我们在肇庆皇潮搞个活动，房间设施各方面比星湖大酒店最起码高一个级别只需260元。,"There is a parking lot, the room is clean and quiet, and the price is pretty good in all aspects. The price is still higher in Zhaoqing.Last time we worked at the Zhaoqing emperor, and the room facilities were at least 260 yuan higher than that of Xinghu Hotel in all aspects."
1,还不错，就是比较难找，因为长宁路太长了。打车的话，司机一般也找不到，浪费了很多时间。,"Not bad, it is more difficult to find, because Changning Road is too long.If you take a taxi, the driver is generally not found, and it is a waste of time."
1,酒店不错，服务人员都很好，比较有礼貌。干净，清静，交通也算方便。缺点是退房狂慢，花掉我半个小时...,"The hotel is good, the service staff are very good and polite.Clean, quiet, and convenient transportation.The disadvantage is that the check -out home is slow, spending me half an hour ..."
1,酒店很安静，位置不太好找，我在长宁路和遵义路口转了一圈也没看到，最后根据门牌才找到，1600弄。从中山公园地铁站下来后，往西沿长宁路右边走，先后经过中山路口（高架），然后再往前左手边一条路就是遵义路，不要拐过去，继续往前走（长宁路右手一直走），一条小巷，巷口挂了长宁路1600弄。酒店离地铁站，龙之梦购物中心非常近，逛街，吃饭，交通都很方便。物有所值！但与锦江之星的价格差实在太小，239和249，如果携程给的价格再能优惠点，那就非常好了！补充点评2008年4月1日：补充一下，锦江之星的会员价比携程低，只要224。如果有会员卡就不要在携程订了，会员卡需要158元买，经常住的话很划算的,"The hotel was very quiet and the location was not easy to find. I turned around at Changning Road and Zunyi Road and I didn't see it. Finally, I found it according to the house card.After getting down from Zhongshan Park Metro Station, walk to the right side of Changning Road west, pass through the Zhongshan intersection (elevated), and then go forward on the left hand side to Zunyi Road.), A small alley, the lanes were hung with 1600 Changning Road.The hotel is from the subway station. The Dragon Dream Shopping Center is very close. Shopping, eating, and transportation are very convenient.Value!But the price difference with Jinjiang Star is too small, 239 and 249. If the price given by Ctrip can be preferential, it is very good!Supplementary comment on April 1, 2008: In addition, the member price of Jinjiang Star is lower than that of Ctrip, as long as 224.If you have a member card, don’t bind it in Ctrip. The membership card needs 158 yuan to buy it. If you often live, it is very cost -effective"
1,房间宽敞，很干净，墙上挂着小型液晶电视机，卫生间没有浴缸只能淋浴，不过不成问题。长宁路是个大马路，但因为酒店位于弄堂里，所以环境比较安静。我比较喜欢锦江大厨，价廉味美，服务态度也还可以。229元的房价的确很有竞争力。网络速度有点问题，经常有中断或连接不上的情况。,"The room is spacious and clean. There are small LCD TVs hanging on the wall. There is no bathtub without a bathtub, but it is not a problem.Changning Road is a big road, but because the hotel is located in the hall, the environment is relatively quiet.I prefer chefs in Jinjiang, cheap and delicious, and the service attitude is okay.House prices of 229 yuan are indeed competitive.The speed of the network is a bit problematic, and there are often cases of interruption or cannot be connected."
1,作为经济型连锁酒店，我觉得锦江之星要比如家、莫泰等高出一筹。最明显的就是房间本身够宽敞，厕所也不局促，马桶还是加长型的呢。10元的早餐算丰富的。整个酒店的色泽和基调看着舒服，如家就土点。,"As a economy chain, I think the star of Jinjiang is as high as home and Motai.The most obvious is that the room itself is spacious, and the toilet is not cramped. The toilet is still extended.10 yuan breakfast is rich.The color and tone of the entire hotel look comfortable, as far as the home is soil."
1,"同样的房间有小有大，地理位置比较偏远。早饭不是自助餐形式的，采用的是套餐形式。不能够自己选择的，套餐之外的要自己购买的。这个很不方便，本人不是很喜欢。宾馆反馈2008年4月7日：非常感谢您光临我们酒店,也感谢您对我们酒店的关注和提出一些问题,酒店同一种房间大小都是一样的.关于同样的房间有小有大的问题,是在客人原订房型不足用或出现异常问题时,我们酒店为了保障预订客人的房间而给予客人免费升级入住所产生的情况.酒店早餐是套餐形式.共有8款固定中式茶点套餐供客人选用,套餐之外需增加其它点心客人需自已购买.给您造成不便我们深表歉意!欢迎您的再次光临我们酒店!","The same room is small and large, and the geographical location is relatively remote.Breakfast is not a buffet form, the form of package is used.If you can't choose yourself, you must buy it yourself.This is inconvenient, I don't like it very much.Hotel feedback on April 7, 2008: Thank you very much for coming to our hotel, and thank you for your attention and raising some problems with our hotel. The same room size of the hotel is the same. There are small problems in the same room.It is when the guest originally booked a room type or abnormal problem, our hotel gives guests to the guests to upgrade the residence for free to upgrade the residence in order to ensure that the room of the guests is reserved.In addition to the package, other snack guests need to buy themselves. It causes you to apologize for inconvenience! Welcome to our hotel again!"
1,住了几次，这次还特意带了朋友一起去入住，结果，酒店的早餐让我们太失望了，越来越差啊，九点去的时候吃的东西都没有什么了，以后我是不会再来了。,"I lived a few times, and this time I took my friends to stay together. As a result, the breakfast in the hotel made us too disappointed, and it was worse and worse. There was nothing to eat when I went at nine o'clock.Will come again."
1,不错的酒店，挺实惠的，符合合适的市场定位，石家庄里还挺方便,"Good hotel, very affordable, in line with the right market positioning, Shijiazhuang is quite convenient"
1,"位置离我们单位很近,从价格来说,性价比很高.我要的大床房,168元,前台服务员态度很好,房间硬件一般,但是想想价格也就这样了.还算干净,就是床垫子太硬.BTW:没有骚扰电话,这个很好补充点评2008年3月4日：对了,这里能够免费上网,刚好上网加班一晚,很不错","The location is very close to our unit. In terms of price, the cost performance is very high. The big bed room I want, 168 yuan, the front desk waiter is very good, the room hardware is average, but the price is like this.The mattress is too hard .btw: No harassment call, this is a good supplement comment on March 4, 2008: By the way, here can be free to surf the Internet, just work online for one night, very good"
1,连着住了两次燕山，感觉整体环境还可以，只是房间里的配置比其他城市的四星宾馆差不少！竟然连吹风机都没有！卫生间里分别有淋浴间和浴盆，这点设计比较善解人意！,"I lived in Yanshan twice in a row, and I felt that the overall environment was okay, but the configuration in the room was much worse than the four -star hotels in other cities!There is no hair dryer!There are shower rooms and bathtubs in the bathroom. This design is more unsatisfactory!"
1,房间大，细节不好，住过上海新梅万豪，三亚万豪，这个万豪最差。把我订房的携程积分都弄丢了，呵呵，携程问过我好几次，很烦。最后还是没用。补充点评2008年4月10日：是的，空调也不好调节，弄了几遍都不合适，早餐那个简单，简单得过分了。,"The room is large and the details are not good. I have lived in Shanghai Xinmei Marriott, Sanya Marriott. This Marriott is the worst.I lost all the Ctrip points I reorganized. Hehe, Ctrip asked me several times, it was annoying.In the end, it is useless.Supplementary comment on April 10, 2008: Yes, the air conditioner is not easy to adjust. It is not appropriate to get it a few times. The breakfast is simple and simple."
1,总体来说各项指标符合万豪的水准，况且遇上特价期，价格非常有吸引力，套房浴室的冲浪浴缸非常舒服，在外面玩了一天回来享受一下泡泡浴，既能缓解疲劳，还能滋润干燥的肌肤，当然泡泡浴露自带！地点稍微有点偏，打的有的司机不知道在哪，得告诉在航天桥才明白。游泳池不是在酒店内，是酒店借用旁边一个健身中心的，条件一般，开放时间倒是挺长的。房内大瓶的依云矿泉水只卖48，这个价格相比其他五星级酒店消费水平真的不贵哦！,"Generally speaking, various indicators are in line with the level of Marriott. Moreover, the price is very attractive when encountering a special period. The surfing bathroom in the suit room is very comfortable. After playing outside for a day, I can enjoy the bubble bath.Moisturizing and dry skin, of course, bubble baths with your own!The location was a bit biased. Some drivers who played did not know where they were, and they had to tell the Aerospace Bridge to understand.The swimming pool is not in the hotel, but the hotel borrows a fitness center next to it. The conditions are average, and the open hours are quite long.The large bottle of Yiyun mineral water in the room is only sold for 48. This price is really not expensive than other five -star hotels!"
1,不亏了Marriott的名字。这才是真正的5星级宾馆：舒适的房间，一流的服务。就是地方偏些，出租车司机不知道。我会再住这家,"Do not lose the name of Marriott.This is the real 5 -star hotel: comfortable room, first -class service.It ’s a bit more place, and the taxi driver does n’t know.I will live again"
1,订的商务房，虽然很小装修陈旧，但是家具倒是很有古都特色，早餐一般，但却是25楼的旋转餐厅用餐，看楼下的牡丹广场很不错，可惜洛阳的天老是阴霾,"Although the business houses are small, the furniture is very old -fashioned. The breakfast is average, but it is a rotating restaurant on the 25th floor. It is very good to see the peony square downstairs. Unfortunately"
1,入住这个酒店有一点需要注意的，不要选朝西三环的房间，否则还是可以听得到立交桥上的噪声,"You need to pay attention to staying in this hotel. Don't choose a room facing the West Third Ring Road, otherwise you can still hear the noise on the overpass."
1,"总的来说比较满意，服务好，热情周到，因我们带了小孩，在我们出去玩好回来后，帮我们换了家庭房，房间干净、温馨。房间比较小，不过按这价钱，性价比还是满好的。因为酒店位置较好，离天安门10几分钟路程，离天坛也比较近。酒店东边的前门大街,正在拆了重建。如坐地铁，到前门站后，从到大栅栏那个出口走出地铁站，然后过隧道向南，一是往左一点直接走进胡同，往南一直走，看到门头牌子写着“大栅栏”，然后走进“大栅栏”，就是“粮食店街”，再5分钟就到了。二是往南沿着“煤市街”走，走到看见“云居胡同”就拐进去走到底。如坐汽车，则在“大栅栏”下，望前一点看见“云居胡同”就拐进去。如出去玩，可以走到前门乘地铁，或从“云居胡同”出去到“煤市街”、前门做公交，几乎能到北京各景点，很方便的。","Generally speaking, good service, good service, and passionate. Because we brought children, after we went out to play well, we helped us change the family room. The room was clean and warm.The room is relatively small, but at this price, the price is still good.Because the hotel location is good, it is more than 10 minutes away from Tiananmen, and it is closer to the altar.Qianmen Avenue on the east side of the hotel is removing and rebuilding.If you take the subway, go out of the subway station from the exit of Dasairan from the front door station, and then cross the tunnel to the south. One is to go straight into the alley to the left.""Then walk into"" Dasai Bo "", which is"" Grain Store Street "", and it will arrive in 5 minutes.The second is to walk south along the ""Coal City Street"", and when you see the ""Yunju Hutong"", turn in and go to the end.If you take a car, you will turn in before you see the ""Yunju Hutong"" before you see the ""Yunju Hutong"".If you go out to play, you can go to the front door and take the subway, or go out from the ""Yunju Hutong"" to the ""Coal City Street"" and the front door to make a bus, which can almost go to various attractions in Beijing, which is very convenient."
1,住的比较多，周围吃喝玩购物都方便建议携程以后要给个好折扣,"Live a lot, it is convenient for eating, drinking, and shopping around it. It is recommended that Ctrip will give a good discount in the future"
1,通过朋友介绍住了苏州南林饭店，一进酒店大堂感觉就很好，酒店的行李员、前台服务员、大堂经理都很热情，有种宾至如归的感觉，房间也很有特色，背景墙上有金色字体的诗词，我住的是朝南的景观房，感觉真的很好，一出门就是娱乐酒吧一条街、美食一条街，出门很方便，下次来苏州我还会选择南林的，我也会介绍我的朋友入住南林饭店！,"I lived in the Suzhou Nanlin Hotel through my friends. It feels good to enter the hotel lobby as soon as I entered the hotel lobby.The poetry of the font, I live in the landscape room facing south, it feels really good. When I go out, I will be a street, food and food. It is very convenient to go out. I will choose Nanlin when I come to Suzhou next time.I will introduce my friends to stay at the Nanlin Hotel!"
1,"酒店环境还可以,就是办理入住手续很慢,帮朋友定的,说是房间可以.","The hotel environment is OK, that is, it is very slow to check in, help friends, say that the room is fine."
1,"十一的时候去的洛阳,就住在这家酒店,总的感觉呢,地理位置不错门口就有去龙门石窟的公交车1元一位很方便(我打车去的也只花了30元)前台接待很热情,但缺点是房间实在是小,四星级这么小的房间有点说不过去,但房间里有电脑这点还不错.","When I went to Luoyang in the eleven, I lived in this hotel. The general feeling, the geographical location is very convenient at the door of the door. It is convenient to go to Longmen Grottoes.The front desk reception is very enthusiastic, but the disadvantage is that the room is really small. The four -star room is a bit uncomfortable, but there is a computer in the room. This is not bad."
1,"订的是商务楼,房间设施,周边环境都抵的上5星级的标准,而且在闹市中是一个闹中取静的地方,出门就是十全街和凤凰街.而且在酒店中还有一些文物保护单位,在酒店里面转转也是满不错的.","The business building, room facilities, and the surrounding environment are all worth the 5 -star standard, and in the downtown market, there is a place where you are in trouble.Cultural relics protection unit is full of good turns in the hotel."
1,花园式的酒店，里面矗立着小洋房，很幽静，里地铁也近，出行很方便.,The garden -style hotel is standing with small houses. It is very quiet. The subway is also near. It is convenient to travel.
1,安亭路是很小的一条马路，酒店也算是闹中取静了，花园洋房非常有特色。,"Anting Road is a small road. The hotel is also quiet, and the garden house is very distinctive."
1,环境非常的好，服务也非常的热情、周到下次还会住！,"The environment is very good, the service is also very enthusiastic, and you will live next time!"
1,酒店的环境不错，属于闹中取静。但是房间有点小，早餐太贵了，品种也不多。不过交通还算方便，离地铁不远。,"The hotel's environment is good, and it belongs to the noise.But the room is a bit small, breakfast is too expensive, and there are not many varieties.However, transportation is convenient, not far from the subway."
1,"服务热情,环境也不错,喜欢,就是周围商家不多,吃饭的地方少.宾馆反馈2008年4月15日：感谢您对我们服务的肯定，期待您的再次光临。","The service is enthusiastic, the environment is also good, I like it, there are not many surrounding businesses, and there are few places to eat. Hotel feedback on April 15, 2008: Thank you for your affirmation of our service and look forward to your visit again."
1,"日本客人去苏州新区指定要住的酒店,外观很不错,很气派;室内环境也算对得起这个价钱.还不错.宾馆反馈2008年4月15日：感谢您对我们的肯定，您的鼓励是我们服务的动力，期待您及您客人再次的光临！","Japanese guests go to Suzhou New District to designate the hotel they want to stay. The appearance is very good and very elegant; the indoor environment is also worthy of this price. Not bad. Hotel feedback on April 15, 2008: Thank you for your affirmation. Your encouragement is us.The motivation of service, look forward to you and your guests again!"
1,"在苏州总习惯住这家酒店,也感觉到酒店很用心,每次住总会有一些意外的惊喜,在这边忍不住要夸一下,上次住的时候曾提出房内要多二个枕头,这次没提,没想到一进房就发现床上多了二个枕头,不错,真是不错!","I always feel that the hotel is very attentive in Suzhou, and I also feel that there will be some unexpected surprises every time I live.Pillow, I didn't mention it this time. I didn't expect to find two pillows on the bed as soon as I entered the room."
1,1.前台服务人员很有礼貌与热情。2.定的是大床房，房间空间和格局不错，就是地毯有点脏，冰箱的声音晚上有点吵。3.地点对于晚上想泡酒吧的游客很适合。4.酒店周边很多不错的小饭店。5.这个价位，姑苏的信价比不错。下次还要住这里。,"1. The front desk service staff is very polite and enthusiastic.2. The large bed room is determined. The room space and structure are good, that is, the carpet is a bit dirty, and the sound of the refrigerator is a bit noisy at night.3. The location is very suitable for tourists who want to soak bars at night.4. Many good small hotels around the hotel.5. At this price, Gusu's letter is good.I will live here next time."
1,第一次入住这里，觉得整体上像是住在花园里面。不过感觉苏州的整体风格也是如此。免费升级到了一个稍大的房间。很干净。260包括一个早餐的确是不贵。就是早餐的种类少了点，不过这个价位也就不挑什么了。觉得美中不足的就是宾馆居然没有免费的矿泉水送。。。补充点评2008年8月3日：在这里补充说明一下，260包括一份早餐是房费232+早餐28。提前5天不能取消订单不能修改订单才有232这个价位。现在好像Ctrip没有了。。。宾馆反馈2008年8月6日：感谢两位尊贵的客户给予我们的点评，我们会继续努力并按照您提出的意见积极改进。在此，提醒大家，我店参加携程提前5天预订，打9折的活动，截止日是2008年8月31日。我们真诚的欢迎您们的下次光临!,"The first time I stayed here, I felt like living in the garden as a whole.But it feels like the overall style of Suzhou.Free upgrade to a slightly larger room.Very clean.260 includes a breakfast is indeed not expensive.That is, there are fewer types of breakfast, but this price does not pick anything.Those who feel that are not enough is that the hotel does not have free mineral water.EssenceEssenceSupplementary comment on August 3, 2008: Here is a supplementary explanation that 260 includes a breakfast for a house fee 232+ breakfast 28.It is not 232 to cancel the order or modify the order for 5 days in advance.It seems that Ctrip is gone now.EssenceEssenceHotel feedback on August 6, 2008: Thanks to the comments that two distinguished customers gave us, we will continue to work hard and actively improve according to your opinions.Here, I remind everyone that our store participated in Ctrip's booking 5 days in advance and a 10 % discount on August 31, 2008.We sincerely welcome your next visit!"
1,地理位置不错，闹中取静。房间比较干净，布局合理。但是隔音效果太差了，有住简易客栈的感觉。临水的房间风景不错，很舒适。楼道的地毯比较脏，跟其他装修不和谐。补充点评2008年7月27日：本人是7月18日入住该酒店大床房，价格为338元。,"The geographical location is good, and the noise is quiet.The room is relatively clean and the layout is reasonable.But the sound insulation effect is too bad, and it feels like living in a simple inn.The scenery of Linshui's room is good and comfortable.The carpet on the corridor is relatively dirty and is not harmonious with other decoration.Supplementary review July 27, 2008: I stayed in the hotel's large bed room on July 18 with a price of 338 yuan."
1,这是一个闹中取静的酒店，环境幽雅，交通方便，房间设施处处体现了环保、简约的理念。整体来说，应该是麻雀虽小，五脏俱全！很喜欢！携程的价格给的很公道，个人认为物超所值！比我以往住过的价格高的酒店，更适合游者！如果下次去，还要住那里！补充点评2008年7月25日：我知道很多人一般都不相信文字的点评。不过没关系，我在我的空间一篇关于“苏州住宿样板”的文章中，上传了一张实地的照片。看看就知道，值不值得住这样的酒店了！地址是：,"This is a quiet hotel in trouble. The environment is elegant and convenient to transport. The room facilities reflect the concept of environmental protection and simplicity.Overall, it should be that the sparrows are small, all the internal organs!like very much!The price of Ctrip is very fair, and I personally think it is worthwhile!Hotels that have been higher than I have lived in the past are more suitable for tourists!If you go next time, live there!Supplementary review July 25, 2008: I know that many people generally do not believe in the comment.But it doesn't matter, I uploaded a photo of a field in my space about ""Suzhou accommodation model"".If you look at it, it is not worth living in a hotel!address is:"
1,性价比很高。虽然是没有挂牌按照四星标准建造，但是非常不错。房间很大设备齐全。酒店所处位置交通便利，离成都热闹繁华地带近。同行的几个同事的评价都很高。,"The cost performance is very high.Although it is not listed in accordance with the four -star standard, it is very good.The room is large and complete.The hotel is convenient for transportation, closer to the lively and prosperous area of Chengdu.The evaluation of several colleagues of the peers is very high."
1,"在成都糖酒会期间入住该酒店,很感动在全城酒店出奇紧张的情况下酒店为我把房间升级成了豪华间,且酒店服务很到位,没有发现楼下朋友说的那些情况.房间由于是豪华间,所以感觉很赞,很干净,完全有4star标准.总之,即使是糖酒会期间的488,也比上海的酒店性价比高太多了.PS,酒店出门右边斜对面就是春熙路步行街,交通很方便.","Checking into the hotel during the Chengdu Sugar and Wine Club, I was very moved to the hotel to upgrade the room into a luxurious room for me when the hotel was surprisingly nervous, and the hotel service was in place.It is a luxury room, so it feels very good, very clean, there are 4STAR standards. In short, even 488 during the sugar and wine club is much higher than the hotel in Shanghai.Pedestrian street, transportation is very convenient."
1,因在道大，到中裕住了天，一天是免升的套，一天是豪。施可以，就是冰箱面西可消。最近施工，早上略吵。交通算方便。,"Because of the Daolian, I lived in Zhongyu, a day -free set, and one day.Apply, the refrigerator can be disappeared west.Recent construction, a little noisy in the morning.It is convenient for traffic."
1,地点看上去不错，在北京西客站对面，但出行十分不便，周边没有地铁，门口出租车倒是挺多，但就是不带你，除非你上去就跑一百元以上，如果只是起步价，一边凉快去，他说他有事，要不就是马上回家吃饭不顺路。周边环境很差，一天到晚人如潮涌，附近超市、商场的东西赚的都是过路客的钱，价格狂贵。好在四周饭店挺多，肯德基、永和豆浆，加州牛肉面等一应俱全，还算方便。酒店服务不行，携程订的房间，注明上午8点左右入住，但一直没有空房，等到下午一点才入住，还是个残疾人专用房，房间还行，挺大，可以免费宽带上网。结帐时，前台都是实习生，业务不熟练，速度不快，差点误了火车。另外，我一同事先行离店，竟然多刷四千元，等人走后，酒店发现差错，态度还不错，联系上本人退还差价。,"The location looks good, opposite Beijing West Passenger Station, but travel is very inconvenient. There is no subway around, and there are quite a lot of taxis at the door, but you do n’t take you more than one hundred yuan.Go, he said that he had something to do, or he would go home immediately to eat.The surrounding environment is very poor, and the night is like a tide. The things in the nearby supermarkets and shopping malls make money by passers -by, and the price is expensive.Fortunately, there are a lot of restaurants around, and KFC, Yonghe Soy Milk, California Beef Noodles, etc. are all convenient, which is convenient.The hotel service does not work. The room booked in the Ctrip indicates that it is staying at around 8 am, but there is no empty room. It is not until one o'clock in the afternoon. It is still a dedicated room for the disabled. The room is still there.At the checkout, the front desk was an intern. The business was unfamiliar and the speed was not fast.In addition, I left the store together in advance, and even brushed 4,000 yuan. After the people left, the hotel found that it was wrong. The attitude was not bad."
1,"不错,还有果盘送,交通方便,网速快些就好了.","Yes, there are fruit disks, convenient transportation, just fast internet speed."
1,"酒店前面就是温泉公园,环境还算ok.我下午3点左右到酒店,在前台等check-in时等了十多分钟才有服务员替我办手续.不过,退房时就很快.房间也算整洁,但洗手间的毛巾有一点点油烟味似的.自助早餐只是一般.最喜欢的是晚上大堂有人弹钢琴,很好听.","The hotel in front of the hotel is the hot spring park, the environment is OK. I arrived at the hotel at about 3 pm, and waited for more than ten minutes to wait for the check-in at the front desk before the waiter to do the procedures for me. However, the room was fast. The room was also fast.Considering, but the towels in the bathroom are a little bit of oil fume. The buffet breakfast is just average. The favorite is that someone played the piano in the lobby at night, which sounds good."
1,因为决定匆忙，我是通过电话预订的金源饭店，携程的客服很耐心，这里先谢谢一下！:)金源饭店环境很好，就在温泉公园的旁边，有空的话还可以去散散步；大堂装修的不错，那天去大概有3对新人在那里举行婚礼，都笑得好幸福（羡慕ING）；前台CHEKIN速度很快，还没有5分钟我就拿到了房卡；一到房间就有服务生送上当天的报纸，和福州市区的地图；房间里的设施也很人性化，有音乐，还有drinkingwater，我的外国老公说在中国其他酒店他还没见过（赞一下！）；那天小小泡了一下澡，非常舒服，浴缸很干净，泡澡水还是天然的温泉水。总的来说，金源饭店让我们在福州的旅行非常愉快，下次还会再定这家酒店！,"Because I was in a hurry, I was booking by the Jinyuan Hotel by phone. Ctrip's customer service was very patient. Thank you here first!:) Jinyuan Hotel's environment is very good, just next to the Hot Spring Park, you can go for a walk if you have time; the lobby decoration is good. On that day, there were about 3 new couples where the wedding was there.); The front desk chewin is fast, and I get the room card without 5 minutes. As soon as I arrived, the waiter sent the newspaper of the day and the map in Fuzhou City.And Drinkingwater, my foreign husband said that he hadn't seen it in other hotels in China (like it!); I took a bath that day, very comfortable, the bathtub was very clean, and the bath water was still a natural hot spring water.In general, the Jinyuan Hotel allows us to travel in Fuzhou very well, and we will make another hotel next time!"
1,房间还不错，就是小了点。客房服务员还满负责任。早餐好贵。,"The room is not bad, but it is a little small.The guest room waiters are also responsible.Breakfast is so expensive."
1,"08.2.9入住该酒店,我觉得酒店其他方面都很好,唯一欠缺的是气派的大堂总是充满了油烟味.","08.2.9 Checking into the hotel, I think the hotels are very good. The only lack of the lobby is always full of oil fume flavor."
1,是一相不的酒店，性比可以。房大也乾，下次到福州再入住此酒店。,"It is a non -phase hotel, which is okay.The house is also dry, and next time I go to Fuzhou, stay in this hotel."
1,"卫生间蛮宽敞，有淋浴房，也有浴缸，是分开的。就是晚上到的时候，听到一帮子人在西餐厅吼卡拉ok,实在是太不雅了,也太扫兴了。","The bathroom is quite spacious, with shower rooms and bathtubs, which are separated.When I arrived at night, I heard a group of people roaring the roar in the western restaurant."
1,一家三口入住两天，很满意的一家宾馆。房间宽敞舒服，硬件设施不错。宾馆内部环境也是园林设计，不错。服务较好，前台速度可以，行李生和免费电瓶车司机非常有礼貌。另外，地段很好，出门就可以兜马路，就在市中心。这次带了宝宝，下次会试一下宾馆的SPA。另外，推荐入住蒋家别墅房，我们虽然没住，但参观过了，也进去看过一间正在打扫的房间，很不错，就是白天会有很多人来参观。,"The family of three stayed for two days, a very satisfying hotel.The room is spacious and comfortable, and the hardware facilities are good.The internal environment of the hotel is also a garden design, which is good.The service is good, the front desk speed is okay, and the driver of luggage and free battery car is very polite.In addition, the location is very good, you can go to the road when you go out, just in the center of the city.I brought the baby this time, and I will try the SPA of the hotel next time.In addition, I recommend staying in the Jiang family villa room. Although we have not lived, we have visited and went in to see a room that is cleaning. It is very good, but many people will visit during the day."
1,这是济南我最喜欢的酒店，服务好，房间干净整洁，卫生间的淋浴设施也很好，不像有的皇冠假日或者洲际的喷头那么老式~已经是第4次住了，下回还会选这家！,"This is my favorite hotel in Jinan. The service is good, the room is clean and tidy, and the shower facilities in the bathroom are also very good. Unlike some crown holidays or intercontinental nozzles, it is the fourth time.this home!"
1,游泳池和洗浴中心在一起，感觉怪怪。不如郑州的皇冠，中国特色十分浓烈的东西还是跟西方连锁酒店的品牌分开好,"The swimming pool and bathing center are together, and it feels weird.Not as good as Zhengzhou's crown, things with very strong Chinese characteristics are still separated from the brand of Western chain hotels."
1,整体上比较满意但是房间没有想象中的理想没有同样是五星级的济南索菲特的房间好,"Overall is more satisfied, but the ideal of the room has no imagination."
1,济南最好的酒店，服务也不错，难得是还有印度厨师！,"The best hotel in Jinan, the service is also good, it is rare to have Indian chefs!"
1,服务很好，尤其是宾馆的客户经理，服务尤其的好，为客人想的很周全，在此点名表扬不太好，房间也不错，下次去还住这里。,"The service is very good, especially the customer manager of the hotel, the service is particularly good, and the thoughts for the guests are very thorough. The praise of this name is not very good, and the room is also good. I will live here next time."
1,在兰州应该算非常好的酒店了，还调了一个带电脑的房间，呵呵,"It should be a very good hotel in Lanzhou, and I also transferred a room with a computer, haha"
1,非常好。位置繁华，挨着中信大厦（暂时是广州最高的楼），房间很舒服，服务也非常好。价格也相对便宜。下次还会去。,"very good.The location is prosperous, next to CITIC Building (temporarily the highest building in Guangzhou). The room is very comfortable and the service is very good.The price is relatively cheap.I will go next time."
1,酒店各方面都很好，尤其是前台服务员英语都不错。CHECKIN、CHECKOUT的速度很快。,"The hotels are very good in all aspects, especially the front desk waiters are good English.Checkin, Checkout is fast."
1,酒店没有想象中和介绍中的那么好。1188的房间很嘈杂，1楼的阳台走出去感觉像是住在大街边。房间也不大。后来换了行政房，也不是很满意。虽然房间大很多，可是其他物品感觉都不好。,"The hotel is not as good as the introduction.The room of 1188 was noisy. The balcony on the first floor went out and felt like living on the street.The room is not large.Later, I changed the administrative house, and I was not very satisfied.Although the room is much larger, other items feel bad."
1,住了不下七八次，是虹桥迎宾馆的老住户了。每次得到的服务说实话都很不错，有时还有免费升级，让人感到亲切舒心。但是这次入住，因为各种原因而颇为有些扫兴，希望酒店能考虑改进。1）可能是季节价格的原因，这次好像房价上升比较显著。后面又有公司的制定的规矩，所以只好预定最低的普通房。没想到普通房的设备比预想要差，比如书桌和电视不相对，淋浴要和浴缸在一起而不是单独的淋浴房，窗外景色较差。如果是这个价格住这样的酒店就稍感不值得。2）最后一天房间的空调坏了，把房间弄得像桑拿房（毫不夸张）。最后换了一个房间，却是比原来更差的双床房。想起以前经常能获得免费的升级，所以这次也就不特别计较了。只是稍稍失去自己长期以来对酒店的好感，很是可惜。宾馆反馈2008年4月9日：首先感谢您一直以来对我宾馆的支持和您中肯的意见。我们非常抱歉在您的入住期间，由于空调问题所给您带来的不愉快。其实对于老住客，我宾馆一直是给予特别的关注和安排的。对于您下次的到来，我们一定予以更进一步的关注。随着上海整体客源市场情况的变化，在全力提升我宾馆各项细节化服务的前提下，我宾馆的价格体系确有所调整。但是目前每周五、六、日还是有周末促销价格推出，尤其是行政房在推出优惠价格的情况下，仍予以宾客享受诸如：免费使用下午茶、根据宾馆入住率可延长退房时间至下午16：00、免费使用指定会议室两小时、入住首日赠送欢迎鲜花水果等一系列优惠政策。建议您可关心一下我宾馆推出的各类优惠促销活动，再根据自身的要求有针对性地选择性价比最高的产品。希望您能够一如既往地支持我宾馆，我们也将以更出色的服务来回报您。,"I have stayed seven or eight times, and it is an old resident of Hongqiao Welcome Hotel.To be honest, the service you get is very good, and sometimes it is free to upgrade, which makes people feel kind and comfortable.However, this time I stayed with some reasons, and I hope the hotel can consider improvement.1) It may be the reason for the seasonal price. This time, it seems that house prices have risen significantly.Later, there is the company's formulation rules, so I have to book the lowest ordinary house.I did not expect that the equipment of ordinary rooms was worse than expected. For example, the desk and TV were not relative. The shower should be with the bathtub rather than a separate shower room. The scenery outside the window was poor.It is not worth it if it is a hotel at this price.2) The air conditioner in the room on the last day was broken, making the room like a sauna (no exaggeration).In the end, I changed a room, but it was worse than the original double bed.Thinking of free upgrades, so I did not care about this time.It is a pity that it is a pity that I have lost my long -term favor for the hotel for a long time.Hotel feedback on April 9, 2008: First of all, thank you for your support for our hotel and your opinions.We are very sorry for your unpleasantness due to the air conditioning problem.In fact, for old residents, my hotel has always given special attention and arrangement.We will definitely pay more attention to your next arrival.With the changes in the market situation of the overall customer source of Shanghai, the price system of our hotel has indeed been adjusted on the premise that the detailed service of our hotel has been fully improved.However, there are still weekend promotion prices every Friday, Saturday, and Sundays, especially when the preferential price of administrative housing is still enjoys guests such as: free afternoon tea, according to the hotel's occupancy rate16:00, a series of preferential policies such as the designated conference room for two hours, and the first day of staying in the stay. Welcome flowers and fruits.It is recommended that you care about the various preferential promotions launched by our hotel, and then have the most targeted and cost -effective products according to your own requirements.I hope you can support our hotel as always, and we will also return you with better services."
1,这个酒店是我们不少同事出差上海的首选，非常不错。,"This hotel is the first choice for many of our colleagues to travel in Shanghai, which is very good."
1,大堂门口外管理停车的保安不尊重客人，一辆市府领导的车停在对面，那一长条的车位就不准停车。更重要的事出言不逊，“这地方是你社会车辆能停的吗？”真让我在美国同事（懂汉语）面前觉得丢中国人的脸！,"The security guards who manage parking outside the lobby do not respect the guests. The car leader of a city government is parked across the opposite side, and the long parking space is not allowed to park.What's more important is not to say, ""Can this place be stopped by your social vehicle?"" It really made me feel like a Chinese face in front of American colleagues (understand Chinese)!"
1,此酒店地理位置不错，旁边的太湖广场相对比较热闹，对于爱购物的朋友是个好住处，大院里空气相对较好，不愧为花园酒店，不过房间空间感觉不够，我们住的大床宽度也只有1.5M，总体感觉还是不错。,"This hotel has a good geographical location, and the Taihu Plaza next to it is relatively lively. It is a good residence for friends who love shopping. The air in the courtyard is relatively good. It is indeed a garden hotel. However1.5m, the overall feeling is still good."
1,服务很好，房间比较温馨，还有篮球场，可惜玩的人比较少，比较安静，适合休息。,"The service is very good, the room is relatively warm, and there are basketball courts. Unfortunately, there are fewer people playing, relatively quiet, suitable for rest."
1,酒店里的工作人员很热情大方、每次走过，工作人员都会投上微笑并说您好，让人心情不错。,"The staff in the hotel is very enthusiastic and generous. Every time I go, the staff will throw a smile and say hello, which makes people feel good."
1,酒店楼前的院子环境不错。房间不太大，但还比较干净，每日赠送水果。出酒店不远有大超市，用餐购物都方便。早餐食物种类不是很多，但也还说得过去。总体感觉还不错。,"The yard environment in front of the hotel is good.The room is not too big, but it is relatively clean.There are not far supermarkets out of the hotel, and it is convenient for meals.There are not many types of breakfast foods, but they can also be said.feels pretty good in general."
1,"酒店坐落的位置很好,闲暇在湖边散步很是惬意.酒店的前厅部人员很热情,去了酒店几次，感觉都不错。","The hotel is located very well, and it is very pleasant to take a walk by the lake. The front hall of the hotel is very enthusiastic and went to the hotel several times. It feels good."
1,比较适合国内客。一楼餐厅风格上有点南洋的味道,More suitable for domestic customers.The style of the restaurant on the first floor is a bit of Nanyang taste
1,"6月在云南经贸宾馆住了两天豪华房,是淡季.用了酒店接机服务和早餐.接机的小姐非常乐心的介绍了昆明和宾馆周围环境.早餐很丰富.房间很干净.服务很好.离市中心很近.","In June, I stayed at the Yunnan Economic and Trade Hotel for two days of luxury rooms. It was the off -season. The hotel pick -up service and breakfast. The lady who took over the aircraft was very happy to introduce the surrounding environment of the Kunming and hotel. The breakfast is very rich. The room is very clean. The service is very clean.Very good. Very close to the city center."
1,去了该酒店几次，感觉都不错。特别是现在还有洗衣免费及赠送中午自助餐的活动，感觉是实惠。另外，总台的几个MM也长的不错哦。,"I went to the hotel several times and felt good.Especially now there are free laundry and gifts for noon buffets, it feels affordable.In addition, several MMs in the main station are also good."
1,酒店在老市中心，交通方便，房间干净。但开办时间较早，与其他四星相比，硬件略差，周围特色饭店较少。,"The hotel is in the center of the old city, with convenient transportation and clean room.However, the opening time was earlier. Compared with other four -star, the hardware was slightly worse, and there were fewer specialty restaurants around."
1,"国庆节期间入住,这儿价格算比较实惠的,只是房间稍微有些陈旧,不能算四星,三星差不多","Checking in during the National Day, the price is relatively affordable here, but the room is slightly old and can not be counted as four stars. Samsung is almost the same."
1,入住鸿鑫感觉非常好，印象最深的就是服务生非常热情、尽职；酒店位置也不错，出门走3、4分钟就是购物一条街，两边都是商场。酒店房间的环境也不错，我住的是豪华标准间，比较宽敞，也很干净、整洁。总之，下次去乌还会住那。在这想对携程提一点的是，我在前台问了一下，豪华标准间打折后的价钱是260元/天，普通标准间的价钱是200元/天，而通过携程定豪华和普通标准间的价钱都是200/天，也就是说普通标准间通不通过携程预定都是一样的价钱，这个就有点说不过去了，希望携程再接再厉，努力为会员提供更大的实惠。,"Hongxin feels very good, and the most impressive is that the waiter is very enthusiastic and due to diligence; the hotel location is also good. When you go out for 3 or 4 minutes, you are shopping for a street, and both sides are shopping malls.The environment of the hotel room is also good. I live in the luxury standard room. It is relatively spacious and clean.In short, I will live there next time I go to Wu.What I want to mention Ctrip here is that I asked at the front desk. The price after discounting the luxury standard room was 260 yuan/day, and the price of the ordinary standard room was 200 yuan/day.The price is 200/day, which means that ordinary standards are the same price without Ctrip's scheduled. This is a bit unreasonable. I hope Ctrip will continue to work hard and work hard to provide members with greater benefits."
1,早餐差，房间没有了免费的咖啡，电视节目少。,"Breakfast is poor, there are no free coffee in the room, and there are few TV shows."
1,440的江景商务标间面积很大，顶棚的灯很亮，看松花江一览无余。报业大厦也终于开通了免费宽带服务，只不过下层朋友说的免费套套已经不提供了。,"The area of the 440 Jiangjing business is very large, and the lights of the ceiling are very bright.The newspaper building has finally opened a free broadband service, but the free sets that lower friends said are no longer provided."
1,性价比还不错，位置很好，就在古镇入口处不远，开车去不要入旅游停车场，跟拦车的人直接说去周庄宾馆。电吹风要打电话要才有。,The price is good and the location is very good. It is not far from the entrance of the ancient town. Do n’t enter the travel parking lot at driving. He directly goes to Zhouzhuang Hotel with the car.The hair dryer must be called.
1,"不错的酒店,性价比可以.交通方便,公司很多客人选择这里.","Good hotel, the price is good. The transportation is convenient. Many customers of the company choose here."
1,酒店从外面看上去有点旧了，内部装潢比较温馨，但也显得有点老了。相对酒店的位置和四星的评级来说价格偏高。服务比较人性化，态度比较好。酒店对面是地铁世纪大道站，后面一片空地好像是要建商业配套，以后肯定会添些人气的。,"The hotel looks a little old from the outside, the interior decoration is relatively warm, but it seems a bit old.Compared with the hotel's location and four -star rating, the price is high.The service is more user -friendly and has a better attitude.Opposite the hotel is the Metro Century Avenue Station. The latter open space seems to be a business facilities, and it will definitely add some popularity in the future."
1,酒店服务很好。入住那晚由于南方大雪，飞机晚了10个小时，打电话给携程被告知必须用心用卡担保，可是当时在机场无法做网银呀。致电给酒店，爽快的答应给留房，比起携程的服务人员强多了！,"The hotel service is very good.On the night of staying in the southern snow, the plane was 10 hours later. I called Ctrip to be told that they had to use cards to guarantee it with my heart, but I couldn't make online banking at the airport at that time.Call for the hotel and quickly promise to stay in the house, which is much stronger than Ctrip's service staff!"
1,客人说总体感觉还不错下次来上海应该还会选择这里,"The guest said that the overall feeling is not bad. Next time I come to Shanghai, I should choose here"
1,非常好的服务，不愧是四星以及Marrito连锁酒店。服务很专业,"Very good service, deserves four -star and Marrito chain.Very professional service"
1,"国产的5星级酒店,地理位置相当不错,只是价格和房价不符,1000多的豪华间房","Domestic 5 -star hotels, the geographical location is quite good, but the price does not match the house price, more than 1,000 luxury rooms"
1,酒店大堂环境不错358的房价还是物有所值，办理入住很快很顺利，让我心情级差的是前台结帐时服务员的傲慢和冷漠态度让人不敢恭维！可能这位小姐心情不是很好对我即是叹气又不耐烦，可是在与老外交谈时态度可以同5星饭店比较一下了。不过这位小姐的形象想进5星还是有点难度哦。,"The hotel's lobby environment is good at 358 house prices, and it is still worth the money. The handling of staying quickly and very smoothly. What makes me feel bad in my mood is that the pride and indifference of the waiter at the front desk will not dare to compliment!Maybe this lady is not in a good mood to sigh and impatient, but when talking to foreigners, she can compare it with the 5 -star restaurant.However, it is a bit difficult to enter 5 stars."
1,很好的一家酒店，适合商务、旅游入住，临近中环线，交通便利，酒店环境我很喜欢，大堂挺气派，房间内的铁艺家具也很有风格，很典雅。酒店服务和其他网友说的一样非常到位，房价也很合理，餐饮确实不错，值得向大家推荐。,"A good hotel is suitable for business and traveling. It is near the Central Ring Road. It is convenient for transportation. I like the hotel environment. The lobby is quite elegant. The iron furniture in the room is also very stylish and elegant.Hotel services are as well as other netizens, and house prices are also very reasonable. The catering is really good and it is worth recommending to everyone."
1,"其实不错啦，可能我住的酒店也比较少，至少在我住的酒店当中这个是不错的，可惜的是电视机实在是太大了。。。如果资金充裕可以考虑换背投的。。。还有房间的地毯可以换的颜色比较好点的。。。服务还是很不错的！！！这点肯定宾馆反馈2008年5月15日：感谢您的光临和点评,我们会认真考虑设备设施的改造问题.","In fact, it is not bad. Maybe there are relatively few hotels I live in. At least in the hotel where I live, this is good. Unfortunately, the TV is too big.EssenceEssenceIf there is abundant funds, you can consider changing the back.EssenceEssenceThere are also better colors that can be replaced by the carpet in the room.EssenceEssenceThe service is still very good!IntersectionIntersectionThis is definitely the hotel's feedback on May 15, 2008: Thank you for your visit and review. We will seriously consider the transformation of equipment and facilities."
1,地理位置不错，离天宁寺很近，就是门面小车库小，停车不方便，服务不错，房间干净，游泳池适合小孩，早餐也不错，作为四星性价比还是高的,"The geographical location is good, it is very close to Tianning Temple, that is, the small garage is small, the parking is not convenient, the service is good, the room is clean, the swimming pool is suitable for children, and breakfast is good."
1,"酒店位置出行比较方便.中西早餐很丰盛,但收市时间9:30早了一点.豪华单间的房间还算不错,空间和设施摆设也合理.但房间部分设施稍显陈旧.补充点评2008年2月29日：补充一下,在房间内提供的网络连接线如同摆设,很短,根本用不上.由于我入往时间太晚,不想打扰服务员过来更换,只有搬出了自己出差常备的网络连接线使用了.","The hotel location is more convenient. The breakfast of China and the West is very rich, but the market reception time is a little bit earlier. The room in the luxury single room is pretty good, and the space and facilities are also reasonable. HoweverOn the 29th: Add it, the network connection cable provided in the room is like a furnishings, which is very short, and it is not used at all. Because I enter the time too late, I don’t want to disturb the waiter to replace it.It's."
1,酒店位置较方便。服务较周到。房间稍显陈旧。房间价格还算合理。,The hotel is more convenient.The service is more thoughtful.The room is slightly old.The price of the room is quite reasonable.
1,郑州长城饭店，是我迄今为止住过的酒店里，服务生态度最好的一家。总是在不经意间，获得问候，感觉非常好。,The Great Wall Hotel in Zhengzhou is the best service ecosystem in the hotel I have lived so far.Always inadvertently get greetings and feel very good.
1,"上周六和老公在那里订的婚,并且住了一晚,总体来说很不错,朋友们也觉得满意,主要说下早餐吧,早餐真的好好,中西早餐几乎都全了,想吃什么都行,环境也不错,服务相当的好呢!","Last Saturday's marriage with her husband, and lived for one night. Generally speaking, friends are also very satisfied. The main thing to say is breakfast. The breakfast is really good.It's okay, the environment is also good, the service is quite good!"
1,酒店的硬件和软件设施都可以．交通也方便．二楼的餐厅挺好吃的，不过价格不便宜．早餐也还还可以．,"Both the hotel's hardware and software facilities can be.Transportation is also convenient.The restaurant on the second floor is delicious, but the price is not cheap.Breakfast is okay."
1,简单来讲，房间还好吧，大过万达假日。不过当时冰雪节比较贵，觉得没那么划算。平时哈尔滨这个烂城市的房价普遍在400左右而已！,"Simply put, the room is okay, greater than Wanda holiday.However, the ice and snow festival was more expensive at the time, and it was not so cost -effective.The housing prices of this rotten city in Harbin usually around 400!"
1,春节期间去住了3个晚上。第一天前台给安排在2305（大床），房间在同层是最小的。第二天在我的要求下换了。总的感觉硬件一般，较旧，显得房价偏贵。房间地毯不少斑迹。酒店位置不错。服务很好，早餐也还可以。,"I lived in 3 nights during the Spring Festival.On the first day, the front desk was arranged at 2305 (big bed), and the room was the smallest in the same floor.The next day was changed at my request.The general sense of hardware is average, older, and it seems that house prices are expensive.There are many spots in room carpets.The hotel location is good.The service is very good, and breakfast is ok."
1,"服务比较热情,设施比较完备,遗憾的是房间隔音效果不好,另外上海菜餐厅只是把菜量上海化了,但味道还是很厚重","The service is more enthusiastic and the facilities are relatively complete. Unfortunately, the sound insulation effect of the room is not good. In addition, the Shanghai cuisine restaurant just puts the vegetables in Shanghai, but the taste is still very heavy."
1,感觉可以。属于哪种既无惊喜，也不失望的哪种。我订的十三楼，较安静，但冷水上不来，没办法洗澡。,"It feels okay.What kind of no surprise and disappointment.The thirteenth floor I booked is relatively quiet, but cold water does not come, and there is no way to take a bath."
1,这次来广州，真的很庆幸，幸好提前在携程订好了房间。本来携程帮我在新世界酒店订的是标准双人房，可是由于开什么美博会，这家酒店生意特别好，标准房和商务房都住满了。由于酒店前台咨询我是一个人入住，便给我免费升级为豪华大床房，比我订的房间高档很多，感觉很满意。特别是前台人员，服务周到。总体来说这家酒店很不错。规模虽不算大，但酒店地理位置好，管理也很到位。特别是服务的素质很高，服务很细心。让我住得满意。我认为是我们出门在外住店的理想选择。,"I was really fortunate to come to Guangzhou this time. Fortunately, I booked the room in Ctrip in advance.Originally, Ctrip helped me order a standard double room at the New World Hotel, but because of what US Expo, the hotel's business was particularly good, and the standard houses and business houses were full.Since the hotel's front desk consults me as a person, I will upgrade to me to a luxurious large bed room for free. It is much higher than I booked a room and I feel very satisfactory.Especially the front desk personnel, the service is thoughtful.Generally speaking, this hotel is very good.Although the scale is not large, the hotel has good geographical location and management.Especially the quality of the service is very high, and the service is very careful.Let me live with satisfaction.I think it is the ideal choice for us to go out in a foreign store."
1,"在金桥开发区/碧云小区附近,走外环去浦东机场很方便.携程的价格很高,房间有点小,早餐很一般.","Near the Jinqiao Development Zone/Biyun Community, it is convenient to walk to Pudong Airport to the outer ring. Ctrip's price is very high, the room is a bit small, and breakfast is very average."
1,春节期间预定，房间硬件设施很好，早餐也比较丰盛，服务态度等各方面符合酒店星级标准，除了地段在浦东外，可能不适合外出观光，商务或访亲时入住是非常好的选择。,"During the Spring Festival, the room's hardware facilities are very good, breakfast is relatively abundant, and the service attitude is in line with the hotel star standards. Except for the location in Pudong, it may not be suitable for going out to tourism. It is a very good choice for business or visiting."
1,其它都可以但本次提供的房间不好窗户离墙只有几公分，应事先和客人打个招呼说明一下，否则很郁闷。,"Others can be available but only a few cm away from the walls provided this time. You should say hello to the guests in advance, otherwise it will be very depressed."
1,不错的酒店.离市中心稍远.但,Good hotel. It is a little farther away from the city center. But
1,在义乌临时改变行程，因此凌晨给携程打的电话，印象中大家对此酒店评价不错，于是预定了。第二天在GPRS的指引下，来到酒店，虽然走了点弯路，总体还算方便找到。红星剧场不是影院，是表演的，只是初三到的时候没有演出。以下是自己的感觉，先说优点：1、车停到地下车库，有人来登记车牌，住宿免费停车。赞一声，感觉有安全感；2、预定的是大床房，那床真的是超级大，一家三口睡上绰绰有余。CHECKIN/OUT很快，服务很好；3、热水出水量大，洗澡舒服！排气很好！4、免费上网，虽然网速不算太快，但还是可以的。再说缺点：1、房间的空调严重有问题，据服务生说：高层的好些，底层的，特别是朝北的，是很冷！这几天杭州很冷，原本想早点回到酒店可以暖和一下，但是还是不可以脱外套。想调高层的，回答到高层只有双床的，没有大床的！不爽！晚上只能再上盖二条毯子！也在想如果是夏天的话，9楼的冷空调会不会很热呢？？2、携程上说含双早，可是酒店说不含早！已经向携程投诉了，回答说春节不含早！不爽！这应该算在酒店上还是携程上呢？看来大家以后预定的时候，还要留个心！3、预定的时候说是无烟房，原本以为会特意除烟一下的，结果总台只是通知拿走烟缸！哈哈，和大家点评的时候感觉完全不同！4、车库不能直接上房间，要通过大堂！不方便但安全。总之438的价格，如果不含早的话，自己感觉没有特别的优势。因为附近毕竟没有很多的小吃店。到河坊仿古街也要走15-20分钟。宾馆反馈2008年2月20日：首先感谢您的点评！我们认为以上您提到的优点都是我们应该做到的，因为我们酒店的服务宗旨就是“致力于殷勤服务，创造生活天堂”；对您提出的缺点例如空调问题、房间无烟处理等等，我们正在责成有关部门改进，相信下次您入住的时候能够看到我们的改进；我们还是希望您能够对我们多提宝贵意见，以帮助我们改进我们的服务，让我们能够更好的为客人服务。再次感谢您的点评和宝贵意见，欢迎您再次光临！,"In Yiwu temporarily changed the schedule, so I called Ctrip in the early morning. In the impression, everyone evaluated the hotel well, so they were booked.The next day, under the guidance of GPRS, I came to the hotel. Although I took some detours, it was generally easy to find.The Red Star Theater is not a theater, it is performed, but there is no performance when the third junior arrives.The following is your own feelings. First, the advantages: 1. The car is parked to the underground garage. Some people come to register the license plate and park free parking.A praise, feeling a sense of security; 2. The large bed is scheduled, the bed is really super big, and the family of three sleeps more than enough.Checkin/OUT is fast, the service is very good; 3. The amount of hot water is large, and the bath is comfortable!Very good exhaust!4. Free Internet access. Although the speed of the Internet is not too fast, it is still possible.Besides the disadvantages: 1. The air conditioner in the room is seriously problematic. According to the waiter: the high -level is better, the bottom, especially the north, it is very cold!In the past few days, Hangzhou is very cold. Originally, I wanted to return to the hotel early to warm, but I still ca n’t take off my jacket.If you want to adjust the high -level, you only have double beds to answer high -level, there are no big beds!accurate!You can only cover two blankets at night!I also wondered if it was summer, would the cold air conditioner on the 9th floor be very hot?Intersection2. Ctrip said that it contains Shuangzhou, but the hotel said that it does not include early!Already complained to Ctrip, and replied that the Spring Festival is not early!accurate!Should this be counted on the hotel or Ctrip?It seems that when you are booking in the future, you have to keep your heart!3. When you are booked, it is said that it is a smoke -free house. Originally thought it would deliberately remove the smoke, but the main station just notified to take away the pan!Haha, it feels completely different when reviewing with you!4. The garage cannot go directly to the room, through the lobby!Insufficient but safe.In short, the price of 438, if it does not contain early, does not feel special advantages.Because there are not many snack bars nearby.Go to Hefang Ancient Street for 15-20 minutes.Hotel feedback on February 20, 2008: First of all, thank you for your comments!We believe that the advantages you mentioned above are what we should do, because the purpose of our hotel's service is ""dedicated to service and creating a life paradise"";We are instructed to improve relevant departments. I believe that we can see our improvement next time you stay in; we still hope that you can give us more valuable opinions to help us improve our services and allow us to better serve our guests betterEssenceThank you again for your comments and valuable opinions, welcome you to come again!"
1,设施陈旧，衣柜的推拉门是坏的，电视机较小，碰巧酒店在对有线电视网路整改，所以只能收到4，5个频道，晕！房间隔音效果很差。优点是交通还算方便，到金街步行大约15分钟就到了。,"Old facilities, the sliding door of the wardrobe is bad, and the TV is small. It happens that the hotel is rectifying the cable TV network, so you can only receive 4,5 channels, dizzy!The sound sound of the room is very poor.The advantage is that transportation is pretty convenient, and it is about 15 minutes by walking in Golden Street."
1,老式四星级酒店，交通倒是很便利，我们自驾游沪杭高速下来没多少路就到了。我定的是490的豪华大床房，房间倒是挺大，但不知道为什么床比较短。就是比一般的大床要短，如果是1米8以上的男生估计就睡得比较不舒服了。酒店早饭品种还是比较多的。停车场也比较大，停车比较方便。顺便提一句，杭州的司机开车真是野蛮，想怎么开就怎么开，相比之下上海的私家车主自律性真的很好。,"The old four -star hotel is convenient for transportation. There is not much way to travel to Shanghai -Hangzhou high speed.I set a 490 luxury bed room. The room was quite large, but I don't know why the bed was relatively short.It is shorter than the average bed. If a boy of more than 1.8 meters is estimated to be uncomfortable.There are still many hotel breakfast varieties.The parking lot is also relatively large, and parking is more convenient.By the way, the driver of Hangzhou is really barbaric. If you want to drive, you can drive. In contrast, the private car owner of Shanghai is really good."
1,酒店还算不错，整体比较好。有两个缺点，1、网速不知为什么很慢，如果是比较大的文件就总发不出去，就更不用说下电影了。2、电视机总有些频道有干扰，反正我住宿期间没怎么看电视。以上两个缺点，找了服务员，也没解决。服务员只是说，大家都是一样的，统一的，也没有解决办法。不过因为工作方便，我下次还是会住在这家酒店的。,"The hotel is pretty good, and the overall is better.There are two shortcomings, 1. I do n’t know why the Internet speed is very slow. If it is a relatively large file, you ca n’t send it out, let alone the movie.2. There are always some channels for TVs. Anyway, I didn't watch TV during my accommodation.The above two shortcomings were found to find the waiter and did not solve it.The waiter just said that everyone is the same, unified, and there is no solution.However, because of the convenience of work, I will still live in this hotel next time."
1,还行宾馆的设施还是比较全的，服务也比较好，只是我住的那个房间看不到西湖，５５５５５５５５,"The facilities of the hotel are still relatively complete, and the service is better, but the room I live in the West Lake, 55555555555"
1,四星的酒店，虽然有点小小的老式，但是整体感觉还是很干净很漂亮的。早餐的价格也是同等中较为便宜的了，就是加床的价格有点小贵哦！,"Although the four -star hotel, although a little old -fashioned, the overall feeling is still very clean and beautiful.The price of breakfast is also cheaper, that is, the price of bed is a bit expensive!"
1,"大堂的服务员很热情,有宾至如归的感觉。入住的商务客房，除了有电脑，还有多功能传真机，可以在房间copy文件和发送，很方便。使用房间电脑会收使用费，不过上网是免费的，速度也很快。电脑工程师很专业和有效率，及时帮我排除了一些难题。地理位置极好，去会展中心很方便，不必太担心堵车。住的很愉快。","The waiter in the lobby is very enthusiastic and feels like a guest.In addition to the computer, there are also multi -function fax machines in addition to the computer, which can be COPY files and sending in the room, which is very convenient.The use of the room computer will collect us, but the Internet is free and the speed is fast.Computer engineers are very professional and efficient, and help me exclude some problems in time.The geographical location is very good. It is convenient to go to the convention and exhibition center. Don't worry too much about traffic jams.Live very well."
1,"这次是为国外来的同事定的,因为同事指定要王府井附近的宾馆,所以在携程上找了好多家相比较距离后才选了这家.以前没有去那边看过,预定后有些担心.可是同事入住后说,服务员态度很好,房间对照价格来说算是相匹配了,虽然在装修期间,但味道不是那么重.但是房间里的地毯上还是有一点烟味的,喷一些空气清新剂再开一天窗就好了.总的来说要逛王","This time it was set for colleagues from abroad. Because my colleagues designated the hotel near Wangfujing, I found a lot of distance from Ctrip to choose this one.However, my colleagues said that the waiter has a good attitude. The price of the room is matched with the price of the room. Although during the decoration, the taste is not so heavy. However, there is still a little smoke on the carpet in the room.Just open the window for another day. Generally speaking, you have to visit the king"
1,大堂没有其它酒店那么华丽，但房间还不错，而且交通比较便利．,"The lobby is not as gorgeous as other hotels, but the room is not bad, and the traffic is more convenient."
1,据说是当地最好的酒店，价格比较贵，房间很小，楼层不高，但是比较大，到房间的距离有点远，服务比较一般，早餐厅装修的比较有特色，早餐还可以。酒店标称是五星级，但是房间条件和服务达不到五星的水准，除了checkin的时候主动递上一块热毛巾比较有特色。,"It is said that it is the best local hotel. The price is relatively expensive, the room is small, the floor is not high, but the floor is relatively large. The distance from the room is a bit far. The service is relatively average. The breakfast room decoration is more distinctive. Breakfast is okay.The hotel nominal is a five -star level, but the room conditions and services cannot meet the level of five -star. Except for Checkin, it is more distinctive to actively hand in a hot towel."
1,"楼不高,但是转弯太多,方向感不强的人有时会转不清方向.邻近峙山公园,风景不错,早起也可以爬山.","The building is not high, but there are too many turns, and people with a strong sense of direction sometimes can't turn the direction. The neighboring Dakshan Park, the scenery is good, and you can climb the mountain early."
1,"环境不错,应该算CIXI那里比较好的酒店了.性价比也还可以.","The environment is good, it should be counted as a better hotel in CIXI. The cost -effectiveness is okay."
1,"算是市中心入住挺方便的,旁边就是公园和河畔,景色不错,算是个闹中取去静的去处!房间是时尚派的,印象最深的是床,惬意的很以至于躺上去就睡着了,晚餐是西式的自助餐,在夜色中的玻璃幕顶辉映下点点的灯光象星星一样,浪漫的象野外餐一样,到是一种享受吧...嘿嘿,个人认为比较小资一些.附近有很多特色的饭店,走着就可以去了,很是方便!","It is very convenient to stay in the city center. Next to the park and the river, the scenery is good. It is a place to take a quiet place in the trouble! The room is fashionable. The most impressive is the bed.Dinner is a western -style buffet. The lights of the glass on the night of the night reflected the lights like stars. Romantic is like a wild meal. It is a kind of enjoyment ... Hey, I personally think that there are more small bourges. There are many nearby. There are many nearby. There are many nearby. There are many nearby nearby. There are many nearby.Special restaurants, you can go, it is convenient!"
1,座落在华侨城，环境优美，房间也大，服务按５星级标准还应再提高,"Located in OCT, the environment is beautiful and the room is large. The service should be improved according to the 5 -star standard."
1,酒店的设施还是不错的，大堂的布置的比较气派有气氛，房间虽不算很豪华但各种设施很齐全。但可气的是原来看到订酒店有送１００元的餐饮消费券，但你不问就没有得送，因为有这项优惠，我们就去西餐厅夜宵，消费了近３００多元（东西超贵的）．而且走的时候，也没在系统上显示出来，有个大姐级的人物还斩钉截铁的地说自己是大堂经理，从来没有不知道这项，搞得好象是我在无理取闹一样。结果还是在我坚定的要求下，才去咨询其他人员，其他很多人都知道是有的，最后才免了１００元，浪费了我好多时间。,"The hotel's facilities are still good. The lobby is more atmospheric. Although the room is not very luxurious, various facilities are complete.But the angry thing was that I saw that there was a catering consumer coupon for 100 yuan to send a hotel, but if you didn't ask if you didn't ask, because of this offer, we went to the Western restaurant for supper and spent nearly 300 yuan (super expensive things are expensive.of).And when I left, I did not show it on the system. A big sister -level figure also said that I was a lobby manager. I never knew this. It seemed like I was making trouble unreasonably.As a result, at my firm request, I went to consult the other personnel. Many others knew that there were. In the end, it was free of 100 yuan, which was a waste of time."
1,交通还可以，打车的话，还算方便。房间稍小了些，看上去也比较旧了，同价位的酒店中，在北京不算是很好的。早餐惨不忍睹。。。。门童很热情，赞一个,"Traffic is okay. It is convenient to take a taxi.The room is slightly smaller and looks older. In the same price hotel, it is not very good in Beijing.Breakfast is terrible.EssenceEssenceEssenceMen -child is very enthusiastic, like one"
1,去常州基本上都是入住中油的，地段在市区交通比较方便，早饭，房间都很不错，以后还会继续入住。最近附近一条马路在施工，晚上可能有点吵,"Basically, I go to Changzhou to stay in CNPC. The location is more convenient in traffic in the urban area. Breakfast and rooms are very good. I will continue to stay in the future.A nearby road is under construction, and it may be a bit noisy at night"
1,服务态度很不错，呵呵，而且离我们去的地方非常近，非常方便，环境也很好，希望下次还可以住那里,"The service attitude is very good, haha, and it is very close to us, very convenient, and the environment is also very good. I hope that I can live there next time"
1,饭店环境不错，服务良好，门童主动尽职，早餐品种丰富，但房间设施比较陈旧，室内空气不流通有异味，结帐时才得到告知建行龙卡不能完成预受权，害的我第二个星期末预受还没取消。,"The restaurant environment is good, the service is good, the door children take the initiative to do their jobs, the breakfast variety is rich, but the room facilities are relatively old, and the indoor air does not circulate and smells. Only when the checkout can not be informed that the Dragon Card of the CCB can not complete the pre -acceptance. I hurt me at the end of the second week of the second week.Not canceled."
1,房间干净整洁，位置也好，就是缺少部电梯，有点遗憾,"The room is clean and tidy, and the location is good, but the lack of elevators is a bit regrettable."
1,房价干净，设施也挺齐全的。就是价格不算便宜。总的来说还不错,House prices are clean and facilities are quite complete.The price is not cheap.Overall is not bad
1,"房间不错,设施也过得去,感觉走廊的装修挺有特色,服务态度也不错.","The room is good, the facilities are too good, I feel that the corridor decoration is very distinctive, and the service attitude is good."
1,并没有所说的色情电话，服务态度还行。我很晚才到达酒店，然后想吃饭，酒店的餐点时间已经结束。然后我让服务员帮我买吃的，3菜1汤和1盒饭竟然要了我120。贵是贵，不过忍了，只是住一宿而已。希望服务员改进职业道德，不要乱砸人。,"There is no erotic phone call, and the service attitude is okay.I arrived at the hotel very late, and then wanted to eat, and the meal time in the hotel had ended.Then I asked the waiter to buy it for me. The 3 dishes, 1 soup and 1 box of lunch asked me 120.Expert is expensive, but tolerate, just stay.I hope that the waiter will improve professional ethics and not smash people."
1,接机服务不错，就是携程不含早餐不好，488的房间感觉也还可以。总体4分,"The pick -up service is good, that is, Ctrip does not include breakfast, and the room of 488 feels okay.4 points for overall"
1,"位置非常好,在新区和传统城区的交界处,虽然是老酒店了(五年以上),房间设施还是不错的,但我们入住的前两天一切OK,第三天就不整理房间了,要打电话才安排,是规定这样做吗?","The location is very good. At the junction of the new district and the traditional urban area, although it is an old hotel (more than five years), the room facilities are still good, but all the two days before we stayDo you just arrange this? Do you specify this?"
1,这是第三次住在富豪酒店了，房间不错，就是感觉有点贵了，这里的自助餐算是远近闻名了，本地的朋友也会拖家带口来吃，唯一的缺点就是标双和大床间只送1份早餐，1个人住还好，如果两个人住，还要多买份早餐券了，不划算。,"This is the third time I have lived in a rich hotel. The room is good. It feels a bit expensive. The buffet meals here are well -known. Local friends will also drag their families to eat.Only one breakfast is given, and one person lives well. If two people live, buy more breakfast coupons. It is not cost -effective."
1,宾馆新装修过，房间很干净，各种设施都完好。早餐品种较多，可选择余地较大。特别是服务人员的态度非常热情，无论走到哪里，服务人员都会主动问候，回答询问也十分细致详尽。宾馆里客运站极近，很方便。,"The hotel has been renovated, the rooms are clean, and various facilities are intact.There are many breakfast varieties, and there is a large room for choice.In particular, the attitude of the service staff is very enthusiastic. No matter where they go, the service staff will take the initiative to greet them, and the answer to inquiries is very detailed.The passenger station in the hotel is very close and convenient."
1,在这小城市还有这样干净的宾馆，不错！真的是3星硬件，4星服务。就是价格贵了点。但嵊州好像所有物价都贵，吃饭特贵。,"There are still such clean hotels in this small city, not bad!It is really a 3 -star hardware, 4 -star service.It's a bit expensive.However, Lizhou seems to be expensive at all prices, and it is expensive to eat."
1,"2008.4.5入住该酒店南楼大床间,总体感觉不错，符合三星标准。值得赞一下的是客房送餐很好，饭菜好吃，价格也不贵。不足：床垫太软，对于不喜欢睡软床的来说，可能不舒服。","2008.4.5 Checking into the big bed of the hotel's South Tower, the overall feeling is good, which meets the Samsung standard.It is worthwhile that the rooms are good for the room, the food is delicious, and the price is not expensive.Insufficient: The mattress is too soft, and it may be uncomfortable for those who don't like to sleep softly."
1,非常喜欢上海的FOURSEASONS酒店的工作人员素质相当高，什么都想在客人前面，不愧是五星级的酒店，各副其实。与上海许多非常著名的全球知名的五星级酒店相比，其服务与设施都算是很好的。一直在那边开会，会议室的布置相当到位，每次都想到客人想不到的细节。提供的食物也相当可口。在上海举办商务会议，FOURSEASONS一定是我的首选。另外，今年冬天入住的时候，发现酒店提供的沐浴及护肤产品是欧舒丹的呢,"I like the staff of the Fourseasons Hotel in Shanghai very high. The quality of the staff is quite high. I want to be in front of the guests. It is indeed a five -star hotel.Compared with many well -known global five -star hotels in Shanghai, its services and facilities are good.Meeting there, the layout of the conference room is quite in place, and every time I think of the details that the guests can't think of.The food provided is also quite delicious.To hold a business conference in Shanghai, FourSeasons must be my first choice.In addition, when I stayed in this winter, I found that the bathing and skin care products provided by the hotel were from L'Occitane."
1,"特别喜欢房间里的床，睡觉非常舒服。但酒店周围环境不好，特别是很难叫到车，足足等了1个多小时，耽误了不少时间。补充点评2007年11月9日：不喜欢酒店周围的环境,很乱很脏，但老外特别喜欢，据说有上海的特色吧。","I especially like the bed in the room and sleep very comfortably.However, the surrounding environment of the hotel is not good, especially it is difficult to call the car. After waiting for more than an hour, it delayed a lot of time.Supplementary comment on November 9, 2007: I don't like the environment around the hotel. It is messy and dirty, but foreigners particularly like it. It is said that it has the characteristics of Shanghai."
1,酒店细节做得不错，但房间不大，卫生挺好，前台服务还应加强,"The details of the hotel do well, but the room is not large, and the hygiene is very good. The front desk service should be strengthened."
1,通过携程预定该酒店保留到晚上6点的。但是下午3点多接到携程电话，居然说我给酒店打电话取消我的房间，问我有没有这回事。简直很气人！后来到酒店办理入住时，问了前台有没有这回事。他们居然回答的很干脆，有这个事情。酒店也太不负责了，为了自己的入住率就随意取消客人的预定。一点都不配万丽的作风和职业道德。另外，该酒店不能用民生银行信用卡做预授权，只能用中国银行和交通银行。这点很不方便的，请大家以后入住的时候请注意了。,"The hotel is reserved until 6 pm through Ctrip.But I received a Ctrip phone at more than 3 pm, and I actually said that I called the hotel to cancel my room and asked me if I was.It's so angry!Later, when I went to the hotel to check in, I asked if there was any case at the front desk.They actually answered very simply, there was this matter.The hotel is too irresponsible, and the guest's booking is canceled at will for their own occupancy rate.Not worthy of Wanli's style and professional ethics at all.In addition, the hotel cannot use the credit card of Minsheng Bank as pre -authorization, and can only use Bank of China and Bank of Communications.This is very inconvenient, please pay attention when you stay in in the future."
1,北京的酒店不愁客源，尤其是国展周围的。酒店交通因为靠近城铁外出比较方便，从机场过来的大巴在国展有停靠点。周围吃饭巨方便，房间隔音很差，隔壁说话听的很清楚。,"Hotels in Beijing do not worry about customers, especially around the National Exhibition.Because the hotel's transportation is more convenient to go out near the urban iron, the bus from the airport has a stop at the national exhibition.It is convenient to eat around, and the room sound insulation is very poor. The next door is clear."
1,出差去的，总体感觉还可以。距离北京展览馆距离很近，起步费。周围的最大优点是吃饭买东西方便，出门就有特色餐饮--蟹老宋，味道很好。燕丰商场--买东西方便，买水，买吃的都很价廉物美。天天在门口的渝乡人家吃早饭，很大众化的早餐，怀念那里的血糯米粥。。。。酒店服务员比较热情，打扫也比较勤快，卫生工作基本到位，还不错，热水充足，暖气好。也不吵，就是床垫有点旧，可以感觉到弹簧，不是特别舒服。我住的是数码间，提供电脑和上网服务，但是网速不敢恭维，经常掉线和死机，害得经常要重启电脑。比较气人。。。。,"If you go on a business trip, it feels okay.The distance from the Beijing Exhibition Hall is very close, the starting fee.The biggest advantage around is that it is convenient for eating and buying things. There are special catering when you go out-Crab Lao Song, which tastes good.Yanfeng Shopping Mall-It is convenient to buy things, buy water, and buy food is very good.Every day in Yuxiang at the door to eat breakfast, it is very popular for breakfast, and miss the blood glutinous rice porridge there.EssenceEssenceEssenceThe hotel waiter is more enthusiastic, cleaning is also diligent, health is basically in place, pretty good, sufficient hot water, good heating.It's not noisy, that is, the mattress is a bit old, you can feel the spring, not particularly comfortable.I live in a digital room, providing computers and Internet services, but the speed of the Internet is not dare to compliment. I often fall down and crash, and often restart the computer.More popular.EssenceEssenceEssence"
1,位置佳，酒店前面就是栈桥，早起运气好的可以在栈桥上看到电视塔上日出的景象。对面马路上是公交车站点，乘311专线可直达北九水（早上6:45，7:45，8:30从火车站发车，建议提前10分钟侯车，车程1.5小时）。服务令人满意，边看海景边吃早餐的感觉很好。因建于20世纪，装潢一般，但卫生设备是新换的科勒。隔音确实不理想，半夜可以听到隔壁的声音，建议在客人入住时发一张晚上保持安静的卡片。周围环境好一点的吃饭地方少，不过10元打辆车肯定能找到满意的餐厅。酒店走廊的小食品是孩子的最爱，不过大家自觉适量取用哦！,"The location is good. The trestle bridge in front of the hotel. If you get up early, you can see the sunrise on the tower on the tower.On the opposite road is the bus station. You can take the 311 dedicated line to the North Jiushui (6: 45, 7: 45, 8:30 at the train station. It is recommended to 10 minutes in advance, the car is 1.5 hours).The service is satisfactory. It feels good to eat breakfast while watching the sea view.Because it was built in the 20th century, the decoration was average, but the sanitary equipment was newly replaced Kohler.The sound insulation is really not ideal. You can hear the sound next door in the middle of the night. It is recommended to send a quiet card at night when the guest stays.The surrounding environment is better, but 10 yuan can find a satisfactory restaurant.The snack food in the hotel corridor is the favorite of children, but everyone consciously use it in moderation!"
1,服务态度亲切，设备较新！早餐每天更新，不错！,"The service attitude is cordial and the equipment is relatively new!Breakfast is updated every day, good!"
1,挺好的，就是说的是国贸店，可是离国贸的位置有些偏。,"It is good, that is, it is a national trade store, but the location of the trade is a bit biased."
1,"这个如家算是离SOHO现代城最近的一个了,打车一个起步就可以到SOHO现代城的地铁.出差去住了8天.预定的时候跟携程的工作人员说不要靠近电梯不要走廊尽头的,入住的时候果然给安排妥当.前台服务人员态度都很亲切.住进去发现宽带不能上网,要求换房,但是当天已经没有空房了.我也无所谓啦.等第二天有了空房,果然就给我换了一间...早上10块钱的早餐算是很丰盛了,炒菜也不错,很家常风味的那种.地下的保健中心可以叫足疗到房间里按摩.手法还算过的去.最后全开了餐饮发票里,回来可以报销了哈哈...总的来说,200多块钱的宾馆,这个如家算是性价比很高的了.","This home is the closest to the closest to SOHO Modern City. You can go to the subway in SOHO Modern City after a taxi. I lived in a business trip for 8 days. When I was booked, I told the staff of Ctrip.At the time of the arrangement, the attitude of the front desk service staff is very kind. I live in and find that the broadband cannot access the Internet and requires a house to change the house, but there is no empty room that day. I don't care. I have a empty room the next day, and I will change it for me to change me the next day.A room ... The breakfast of 10 yuan in the morning is very rich, and the stir -fry is also good. The kind of home -based health centers can be called enough to massage in the room.In the catering invoice, you can reimburse it when you come back haha ... In general, more than 200 yuan of hotels, this home is considered cost -effective."
1,个人酒店评价等级：很好；偏好；一般；偏差；很差福州美伦华美达大饭店――偏好详细:A-外观-4.0分B-服务-4.0分C-房间-4.0分D-早餐-4.0分备注：01.原本订的是高级房，免费升级到行政楼层，很满意；02.华美达的一贯风格，简约,"Personal hotel evaluation level: very good; preference; general; deviation; very poor Fuzhou Meilun Hua Mida Hotel-preference details: A-appearance-4.0 points B-service-4.0 points C-room-4.0 points D-breakfast- breakfast- breakfast- breakfast- breakfast- breakfast4.0 points Remarks: 01. The original is a high -end house, which is free to upgrade to the administrative floor, very satisfied; 02. Huameda's consistent style, simple"
1,酒店地理位置不错，服务也可以，但装修就比较旧了,"The hotel has a good geographical location and the service is okay, but the decoration is relatively old."
1,很满意，环境很好，晚间无一个骚扰电话，是我住过的唯一无骚扰电话的酒店，也许是新酒店的缘故吧！,"I am very satisfied, the environment is very good. There is no harassment phone call at night. It is the only hotel I have lived in a unwanted call. Maybe it ’s the new hotel!"
1,不过如果团体能拿到好价钱的话还是个不错的酒店,"But if the group can get a good price, it is still a good hotel"
1,"我是春节来的,总体感觉不错,整个酒店被树林包围着,空气清新,虽然有些旧,但是三星的标准还是有的,这里的服务不错,就是离市区稍远,但是打的还算方便,总台可以叫车,5分钟左右就可以到市区,个人意见同,下次有机会的话还住哪儿.","I came from the Spring Festival and felt good in general. The entire hotel was surrounded by the woods. The air was fresh. Although some old, the standards of Samsung were still there. The service here is good.The main station can be called a car, and you can go to the urban area in about 5 minutes. The personal opinion is the same."
1,"选择悦达国际的理由主要是看中它便利的交通,离火车站、汽车站打车15分钟，住的房间还比较干净、整洁，这个价位还算是很合理了，附近有个公园早晨可以步行去，对于早起的人比较适合的，总体还比较满意！","The reason for choosing Yueda International is to see its convenient transportation. It is 15 minutes to take a taxi from the railway station and the bus station.For those who get up early, they are more suitable, and they are generally satisfied!"
1,通过别人介绍在此住过两天，感觉总体服务很贴心，住的11楼的房间，床很舒适，因临时改变行程，打电话到总台帮我订了机票，服务效率很高，很快就送到房间，整体给我的感觉很好。,"I have lived here for two days through the introduction of others. I feel that the overall service is very intimate. The room on the 11th floor where I live in the bed is very comfortable. Due to the temporary change of the trip, I called the main station to help me book a ticket. The service efficiency is very high.Just send it to the room and give me a good feeling."
1,住的是豪华房，面积很大，设施还不错，可能靠马路，有些吵。餐厅的早餐品种很多，价格35元，物有所值。前台的服务很热情，退房后要赶车去上海，行李员一直将行李送到车站，服务让人满意！,"I live in a luxurious room with a large area and the facilities are not bad. It may rely on the road and noisy.There are many breakfast varieties in the restaurant, with a price of 35 yuan and worth it.The service at the front desk is very enthusiastic. After checking out, you have to drive to Shanghai. The luggage staff has always sent his luggage to the station. The service is satisfactory!"
1,"酒店位置还不错,离刘公岛码头和韩国城座的士大约8元钱;员工都很有礼貌,态度很好;早餐不错,中西结合,很多吃的;房间很干净,唯一遗憾的是设施旧了些,尤其被子,是由毯子外面罩了一层被套,不太象4星级的标准;很惨的是最后一天临走时,拿行李箱时,下面柜子的门自己倒下来,立即砸到腿上一条血路子.服务员只知道拿创口贴给我,我瘸着腿到大堂找他们的经理,才有人来帮忙处理伤口.要不服务还可以更高分.没住过其他酒店,下次来,还是想住这里","The hotel location is not bad. It is about 8 yuan from the scholars from Liu Gong Island Wharf and the Korean city seat; the employees are very polite and have a good attitude.The old, especially the quilt, was covered with a layer of quilt from the outside of the blanket, which is not like a 4 -star standard; it is very miserable that when the last day is leaving, when taking the suitcase, the door of the cabinet below fell down and smashed immediately.When I went to a bloody road on the leg, the waiter only knew that I had passed it to me. I lame with my legs to the lobby to find their managers, so that someone came to help deal with the wound. If the service is not served, I can still score.I still want to live here"
1,非常好的地理位置，住的是豪华海景房，打开窗户就可以看见栈桥和海景。记得很早以前也住过，现在重新装修了。总的来说比较满意，以后还会住,"Very good geographical location, living in a luxurious sea view room, you can see the trestle and sea view when you open the window.I remember living a long time ago, and now renovated again.Generally speaking, I will live in the future"
1,我也是通过比较携程的用户评论选择海景的，是第一次住。总体感觉很好，房间硬件一般但很干净，每天有水果、糖果赠送，第一天还送玩偶，小孩子很喜欢。特别要提的是酒店服务很周到，餐饮和包车的价格也很公道，我们在酒店吃了两次晚餐都非常的满意，人均消费在30元左右（含酒水的哦）。同去的朋友都很满意，下次去威海还会住海景的。补充点评2008年7月29日：这里的工作人员各个彬彬有礼，作为一家国有企业实在难能可贵。例如，我早餐后刚在大堂的沙发坐下，服务员立即给我送上茶水和毛巾；我们在二楼公共休息区打牌，服务员见天色将黑，就主动把灯打开......,"I also chose the sea view through comparative Ctrip's user comments. It was the first time to live.Overall feels good. The hardware of the room is average but very clean. There are fruits and candy gifts every day. On the first day, they also give up dolls. Children like it very much.In particular, the hotel service is very thoughtful, and the price of catering and chartered cars is also fair. We have been very satisfied with dinner at the hotel twice. The per capita consumption is about 30 yuan (including wine).Friends who go with them are very satisfied. Next time I go to Weihai, I will live in the sea view.Supplementary comment on July 29, 2008: The staff here are polite, and it is valuable as a state -owned enterprise.For example, I just sat down on the sofa on the lobby after breakfast, and the waiter immediately sent me tea and towels. We played cards on the public lounge area on the second floor. When the waiter saw the sky black, he took the initiative to turn on the light ..."
1,第一次入住瀛洲宾馆，感觉很好，古典园林的设计给人安静祥和的感觉。让我意想不到的是，前台还有会说韩语专门接待韩国客人的服务员。据前台小姐给我介绍很快就有韩餐要推出，而且都是请正宗的韩国厨师做的，价格也参照普通的韩国餐馆不会太贵。前台小姐还介绍说四月份要搞云贵菜美食节，云贵菜还真没机会吃过，这次没机会了，下次来的时候一定要大饱口福。,"The first time I stayed at the Chauzhou Hotel, I felt very good. The design of the classical garden gave people a quiet and peaceful feeling.What makes me unexpected is that the front desk is also a waiter who speaks Korean for Korean guests.According to the front desk, the front desk introduced me to Korean meals to be launched soon, and it was made by the authentic Korean chef. The price is not too expensive to refer to ordinary Korean restaurants.The lady at the front desk also introduced that in April, she had to engage in Yunnan Cai cuisine Food Festival. Yungui vegetables really had no chance to eat. There was no chance this time. When I came next time, I must be full."
1,酒店别具一格，很有一些园林风尚。服务非常到位，无论是门童还是前台乃至清洁女工，处处体现热情、周到和体贴，一家非常温馨的酒店。位置不错，交通便利，距机场18元（可能其他酒店也是这么多吧）。酒店略感有些旧，但一点也影响入住的心情。顺便说一下，因离店仓促，退房时将一项链遗忘房中，事隔一日，想起联系询问，已经由客房部为我保管，并快递与我，很是令人兴奋。,"The hotel is unique, and there are some garden fashion.The service is very in place. Whether it is a gate boy or a front desk or a clean female worker, it reflects enthusiasm, thoughtfulness and consideration everywhere. A very warm hotel.The location is good and the transportation is convenient. It is 18 yuan from the airport (there may be so many other hotels).The hotel is slightly old, but it also affects the mood of staying.By the way, because of the rush to leave the store, the chain was forgotten in the room when checking out. One day after the incident, I remembered contacting and inquiring. I have been kept by the guest room department for me and express delivery to me. It is very exciting."
1,"这是我经常住的酒店,主要原因是请我的客户来南京的,距离我公司很近,酒店本身还可以,价格涨了,但是酒店门脸不显著,不像是4星酒店.如果可以,加一点钱,就可以住中心大酒店了,很气派.距离国信200米","This is the hotel I often live in. The main reason is that I invite my customers to Nanjing. It is very close to our company. The hotel itself is OK.Add a little money, you can stay in the center of the center, very angry. 200 meters from Guoxin"
1,"这个酒店我客人说还不错,我自己没住过，但他是很满意的","My guest said this hotel is pretty good, I haven't lived myself, but he is very satisfied"
1,元旦时候入住的，一直没时间评价，房间很大，就是床单很硬，胳膊和背上都磨的很痛，不过住的还可以，希望把床单换掉,"I stayed in New Year's Day and had no time to evaluate. The room was very large, that is, the sheets were very hard, the arms and back were grinded very painful, but I still couldn't live. I hope to replace the sheets"
1,"位置不错,旁边就是家乐福.交通方便,房间特大,住起来也很舒服,早上阳光可以照到床上,自然醒.游泳池也不错.特别是酒店里的餐厅水准很高.唯一缺点,房内设施稍微老了点,不过我肯定会一直住这里,绝对超值.","The location is good, there is Carrefour next to it, the transportation is convenient, the room is very large, and it is very comfortable to live. The sun can be shown in the bed in the morning, and the swimming pool is also good. Especially the restaurant in the hotel is very high.It's a bit old, but I will definitely live here all the time, absolutely value."
1,同时订的两套房间，入住时间不同，最后拿到的房间也不同，很奇怪今晚酒店的房间怎么老是这样，当然都是升级到更高层次的房间。,"At the same time, the two rooms booked at the same time are different in check -in time, and the rooms they finally get are different. It is very strange that the hotel's room tonight is always like this. Of course, it is upgraded to a higher level of rooms."
1,房间还可以，还有我去的时候大堂摆了一个楼盘的销售模型，感觉有点不适合。,"The room is okay, and when I go, the lobby has a sales model of a real estate, it feels a bit unsuitable."
1,晚11时到前台，小姐笑容可掬的告诉我，我的预定携程并没有确认，不过可以为我安排。虚惊。这是黄金周出行第一站，27日金华。酒店大厅确如楼下所言，大而无当，亦不够明亮，由于到时较晚，行李员下班，我们是自己推车上了五楼，再下4楼（4楼的房间安排比较怪异）时，才匆匆跑来一个小保安，非常卖力地帮我们包大包小包全部搬到房间。家庭房的位置虽出入不便，但房间足够大，卧具柔软干净，设施齐全好用，对于自驾走南闯北的行走族来说足矣！而且酒店还是浙江省旅游局《自驾车旅游服务定点单位》。在此特别感谢27日晚值班的前台，就是她看到我们自己搬行李后马上冲到电梯口帮我们唤来了保安，还要感谢第二天的行李员，不但把行李车推到车前，还帮我把行李全部装好车。如果有机会我还会再住这家酒店。,"At 11 pm to the front desk, the lady told me with a smile that my scheduled Ctrip did not confirm, but could arrange for me.false alarm.This is the first stop of the Golden Week, Jinhua on the 27th.The hotel lobby is indeed as stated downstairs. It is large and unrivaled, and it is not bright enough. Because it was late, the luggage officer got off work. When we got on the fifth floor, we went down the 4th floor (the room on the 4th floor was weird).I hurriedly ran a small security guard, and helped our big bags to move all the bags to the room.Although the location of the family room is inconvenient, the room is large enough, the bedding is soft and clean, and the facilities are easy to use. It is enough for the walking people who drive to the north to the north!In addition, the hotel is also the Zhejiang Tourism Bureau ""Self -Driving Tourism Service Point Units"".I am especially grateful to the front desk on duty on the evening of the 27th. She immediately rushed to the elevator port to help us call for the security guard after seeing our own luggage.And help me install all the luggage.If I have a chance, I will live in this hotel again."
1,酒店服务态度，房间环境都不错，改了名字的原天鸿酒店现在听起来更好听了。,"The hotel service attitude and the room environment are good. Yuan Tianhong Hotel, who changed the name, sounds better now."
1,酒店地理位置不错，房间布置还可以。电视滥了点。厕所不太通畅。房价偏贵。,"The hotel has a good geographical location, and the room layout is okay.The TV is a little bit.The toilet is not very smooth.House prices are expensive."
1,之前来北京住过几家，燕山、文津、天虹等等天虹是我们同事最喜欢住的，房间不大，被褥都很柔软，早餐也还可以但是住过文津之后，觉得文津的服务态度更好一点，出酒店门的的时候门童可真热情,"I have come to Beijing a few before. Yanshan, Wenjin, Tianhong, etc. Tianhong is the favorite of our colleagues. The rooms are not large, the bedding is very soft, and the breakfast can also be available.The attitude is better, when the door is out of the hotel door"
1,酒店设施较好，地理位置靠近中关村，周边饮食餐饮很方便。自助早餐很丰富，但是价钱比较贵。这次正好赶上国际柔道比赛的代表团入住，酒店对普通住客的服务有所下降。酒店大堂秩序比较乱。补充点评2007年11月15日：携程定的酒店房间价格比较贵，我到北京后朋友说他定的价格比我便宜100元，而且还含早餐。希望携程网有所改进。不要每次我我们这些会员当成冤大头！！！,"The hotel facilities are good, the geographical location is close to Zhongguancun, and the surrounding diet and dining are convenient.Buffet breakfast is rich, but the price is more expensive.This time, the delegation of the International Judo competition was in place, and the hotel's service for ordinary residents declined.The lobby of the hotel is relatively chaotic.Supplementary comment on November 15, 2007: The price of the hotel in Ctrip is relatively expensive. After I arrived in Beijing, my friend said that the price he set was 100 yuan cheaper than me, and it also contained breakfast.I hope Ctrip.com will improve.Don't be a biggest head for me!IntersectionIntersection"
1,酒店不错，房间干净整齐，服务也还好。希望在硬件设施上能再多多加强，那就好了哦。,"The hotel is good, the room is clean and tidy, and the service is okay.I hope that it can be strengthened in hardware facilities, that's it."
1,"听朋友介绍选了这里,上周一位日本朋友住在这里,因为语言不通,酒店派专人帮他买船票并送他去码头坐船,非常人性化.我替BABA先生感谢一下!我订的是新装修的标准间,卫生间是半透明的，显得房间很亮,这好象是现在酒店装修的趋势吧~~淋浴有特点,我太太喜欢.总体来说是很满意的.这个酒店是机场巴士的出发站,机场的售票处也设在这里,订票和去机场都很方便。房间给送了果盘和夜间点心,服务员说只有携程的客人是赠送果盘的，不知道是真是假.反正有的吃就好.","I listened to my friends and chose here. Last week, a Japanese friend lived here. Because the language was not available, the hotel sent a person to help him buy a ticket ticket and sent him to the dock to take a boat.It is the standard room of the new decoration. The bathroom is translucent and looks very bright. This seems to be the trend of hotel decoration now ~~ Shower has characteristics. My wife likes it. Generally speakingAt the departure station of the airport bus, the airport ticket office is also located here, it is convenient to book tickets and go to the airport.The room gave the fruit plate and night snacks. The waiter said that only Ctrip's guests were given away the fruit plate. I don't know if it is true or not. Anyway, some eat it."
1,"入住豪华大床房,房间真的很大,沙发,写字台,阳台,的确没有想到是这么大的一间.这一点是我比较满意的.","Check in a luxurious large bed room, the room is really large, the sofa, writing table, balcony, I really did not expect to be such a big room. This is what I am more satisfied."
1,51还是选择了这里，因为贵的太贵，好的都定满了。在51小黄金288元的价格是属于便宜的，之前打电话去游记中有人写到的枫枫旅行社，一个私人开的小旅馆，要240元一晚，傻子都会选择星级宾馆。坐的K197，凌晨三点多出站，宾馆方已经派人来接。凌晨到宾馆，服务小姐很亲切，因为没有空房了，所以让我们在商务中心内上网休息。6点进房，看了一下，床单啦什么的蛮干净。我做好准备，已经带了睡袋。门口的保安很亲切，但是在走的时候，咨询他打的去火车站大概多少钱，估计他有私心了，说要四十。后来再问了前台小姐，说30元不到，并说如果不急可以在路口等5路车，3块一个人。所以评价下来，前台小姐是非常不错的。在那里用过一次晚餐，四个人，吃了80元。评价一下，菜色一般，量还可以蛮多。强烈建议千万别吃他们的糖醋排骨，那真的是骨头，没有一丁点的肉肉。服务员有点糨糊，我们点的酸辣土豆丝中份，上的是小份，价格算的是中份。我问了一下，马上少算4块钱，钱是小事，他们看起来很傻，但他们有点戆进不戆出。没有网上说的什么死不认账。免费的早餐也就那么回事，每天都基本一样，请一直住五星级宾馆的人不要拿五星的标准比啦，新鲜能吃饱就行。头一晚睡房间，觉得房间有股刚装修的味道，感觉很闷，后几天就习惯了。,"51 still chose here, because the expensive ones are too expensive, good is full.The price of 51 small gold 288 yuan is cheap. The Fengfeng Travel Agency written by someone in the travel notes, a privately opened small hotel, cost 240 yuan a night, and the fool will choose a star hotel.The K197 sitting at more than three am out of the station, and the hotel has sent someone to pick it up.I arrived at the hotel in the early morning, and the service lady was very kind. Because there was no empty room, let's rest in the business center.Enter the room at 6 o'clock, take a look, the bed sheet is quite clean.I am ready and I have brought a sleeping bag.The security guard at the door was very kind, but when he left, he consulted him about how much money he went to the train station. It is estimated that he had selfishness and said he wanted forty.Later, I asked the lady of the front desk again, saying that it was less than 30 yuan, and said that if I was not in a hurry, I could wait for 5 cars at the intersection.So after evaluating, the front desk lady is very good.After using dinner there, four people ate 80 yuan.Let's evaluate, the dishes are average, and the amount can be quite large.It is strongly recommended not to eat their sweet and sour pork ribs, it is really bone, without a little bit of flesh.The waiter is a bit confused. The hot and sour potato shreds we ordered are small parts, and the price is considered to be medium.I asked, and it was a trivial matter for 4 yuan. The money was small. They looked stupid, but they were a bit pumped.No one said on the Internet and do not recognize the account.The free breakfast is the same. It is basically the same every day. People who live in a five -star hotel should not take the standard of five -star. Just eat fresh and full.The first night of bedtime, I felt that the room had a just decorated taste, and I felt very stuffy. I was used to it in the next few days."
1,"房间很不错,还是套间,前台服务员很贴心,因楼层少怕吵,特意没有安排向马路的房间给我。酒店地理位置极佳,就在七星岩牌坊斜对面,旁边就是华侨大厦。总的来说很满意,另外楼层走廊真的好长,开眼界了。","The room is very good. It is still a suite. The front desk waiter is very intimate. Because the floor is scared and noisy, I have not arranged for me to the road in the road.The hotel has an excellent location, just opposite the Qixingyan Archway, next to the Overseas Chinese Building.Generally speaking, I am very satisfied. In addition, the floor corridor is really long and the eyes are open."
1,酒店在肇庆闹市区，但靠花园的房间很安静；酒店走廊超乎想象的长，96个房间在一条走廊里。套房超乎想象的进深，从门口到床约15米。七星岩像一个大公园，如果作为城市人群休息的场所很不错，不应收门票（60元），像西湖这样的景区都不收门票。鼎湖山的原始森林很好，特别是蝴蝶谷新开的那一部分，值得去走一走。酒店的饮食不错，但浴足不怎么样，虽然便宜，但水平实在差，技师不像受过准们训练的，没有手法，按不到穴位，环境也不清爽，总体感觉有些龌龊。,"The hotel is in the downtown area of Zhaoqing, but the room in the garden is very quiet; the hotel corridor is beyond imagination, and 96 rooms are in a corridor.The suite is beyond imagination, from the door to the bed for about 15 meters.Qixingyan is like a large park. If it is a place for urban people to rest, it is very good. Do not receive tickets (60 yuan). Scenic areas like West Lake will not receive tickets.The virgin forest of Dinghu Mountain is very good, especially the new part of the Butterfly Valley, it is worth walking.The hotel's diet is good, but the bath is not very good. Although it is cheap, the level is really poor. The technicians are not trained as aimed at. There is no way to press the acupuncture point. The environment is not refreshing."
1,"1.房间设施布置不错,电视机尺寸小了些,点播电影节目还要收费。2.房间墙壁隔音效果不佳,相互影响。3.只有免费的接机服务,不送机,望改进。","1. The room facilities are well -arranged, the TV size is smaller, and the movie show is charged.2. The wall insulation of the room is not good and affects each other.3. Only free pick -up services, do not send the aircraft, look at improvement."
1,地理环境不错，但对面一直在盖楼，门前的街道打车不方便。,"The geographical environment is good, but the opposite side has been built, and the streets in front of the door are inconvenient."
1,几乎是在凌晨才到的包头，包头也没有什么特别好的酒店，每次来了就是住在这家，所以也没有忒多的对比，感觉还行，下次还是得到这里来住,"It was almost in the early morning Baotou, and Baotou had no particularly good hotel. Every time I came, I lived in this house, so I did n’t have a lot of comparison. I feel that it ’s okay. I still get here to live here."
1,挂五星实在有些牵强。卫生间太小，还不如呼市国航四星的大，房间暖风给的太早，又没有冷风和换气，热的人实在难受，只得开着窗，开窗又太吵。早晨赶飞机结帐，必须等服务员查房，简直就是三星级服务，呼市的国航四星都不查房了，十几位客人在大厅里等，大家都很奇怪：这样的房间有什么可拿的？不知道他们查什么。唯一还行的就是410一天房价了，但当地人还是说太贵，等香格里拉开业，这里也就250了。,"Hanging five -star is a bit far -fetched.The bathroom is too small, it is not as large as the four -star Hoh City Airlines. The warm wind is too early, and there is no cold wind and ventilation. The hot people are uncomfortable. They have to open the window and open the window too noisy.In the morning to rush to check out, you must wait for the waiter to check the room. It is simply a three -star service. The four -star Air China of Hohhot does not check the house. More than a dozen guests are waiting in the hall.Can you take it?I don't know what they check.The only thing that is okay is 410 a day's house price, but the locals are still too expensive. When Shangri opened the business, it is 250 here."
1,本想订汉庭，地理位置不错的酒店，从汽车西站叫车过去15元，离文昌阁几步之遥，10分钟可到有名的福满楼，金鹰国际购物中心、时代广场近在咫尺。个园、何园、瘦西湖步行20分钟内均可到达，三轮的话5元没问题。大堂宽敞，房间设施符合三星要求，床铺整洁。只是卫生间略显成旧，用的是浴缸，不过坐厕、龙头都是美标的，水也不是想象中那么小、凉，总体还算不错。10元的早餐内容较少，不过咱也不图这个对吧！哈哈，下次去还订那儿。补充点评2008年5月13日：本想订汉庭，预定已满订了红杉树。地理位置不错的酒店，从汽车西站叫车过去15元，离文昌阁几步之遥，10分钟可到有名的福满楼，金鹰国际购物中心、时代广场近在咫尺。个园、何园、瘦西湖步行20分钟内均可到达，三轮的话5元没问题。大堂宽敞，房间设施符合三星要求，床铺整洁。只是卫生间略显成旧，用的是浴缸，不过坐厕、龙头都是美标的，水也不是想象中那么小、凉，总体还算不错。10元的早餐内容较少，不过咱也不图这个对吧！哈哈，下次去还订那儿。,"I wanted to order the Han Ting, a hotel with a good geographical location.

1,和老婆一起在扬州度了三天的蜜月，在酒店住了三天，感觉很不错，是目前我们住过的最好的三星级酒店了。印象最深的酒店的自助餐，10块钱/人，种类好多啊！吃得我们撑死~哈哈地理位置也比较好，就在繁华的文昌路上，但感觉他们那的电梯怎么坐着让我头晕！总提感觉还是相当不错的，去扬州的朋友建议你们去住一下~哈哈,"I spent three days with my wife in Yangzhou for three days. I lived in the hotel for three days. It feels very good. It is the best three -star hotel we have lived at present.The most impressive hotel buffet, 10 yuan/person, a lot of types!It is better to eat us ~ haha is also better, just on the bustling Wenchang Road, but how do they feel that their elevators are sitting and dizzy!It always feels pretty good. Friends who go to Yangzhou suggest that you stay ~ haha"
1,4月3日4日住了两天，266元/天包双早，携程的价格一般，前台也能拿到。酒店地理位置很好，步行到个园和瘦西湖都10分钟。早餐也可以，唯一的问题是隔音太差，隔壁房间的动静都听得清楚,"I lived for two days on April 3, 266 yuan/daily, and the price of Ctrip was average, and the front desk could be obtained.The hotel has a good geographical location, walking to the garden and thin West Lake for 10 minutes.Breakfast is also fine. The only problem is that the sound insulation is too poor, and the movement of the room next door can be clearly heard."
1,除了价位偏高之外，别的没得说。尤其是房间内的纯水系统，彰显了人性化。,"Except for the high price, nothing else can be said.In particular, the pure water system in the room shows humanization."
1,我喜欢燕春的大房间。设施，电梯，大堂，服务都很不错。,"I like Yan Chun's big room.Facilities, elevators, lobbys, and services are very good."
1,应该算是仪征最好的酒店了，四星的设施，三星的服务。遗憾的是某些设施还并未开放。早餐很一般，连收盘子的服务员也没有，与其四星的标准不符。,"It should be regarded as the best hotel, four -star facilities, Samsung's service.Unfortunately, certain facilities have not been opened.Breakfast is very average, and there is no waiter who closes the market, which is not the same as its four -star standard."
1,不错，房间超大，服务也很不错，而且是别墅式的设计让人感觉挺好的。,"Yes, the room is large, the service is also very good, and the villa -like design makes people feel good."
1,挺不错的一家酒店，专门接待国家领导人的。其中的经济标间小了点，但挺紧凑。不好的就是卫生间全玻璃的。不太方便,"A good hotel, which specializes in national leaders.Among them, the economic standard room is a bit smaller, but it is compact.The bad thing is the whole glass of the bathroom.not very convenient"
1,住过这么多酒店，还是头一次碰到盖黄色的被子，感觉不干净；地毯是黑花的，感觉很脏乱。环境还好，起码有个院子。,"I have lived in so many hotels, and I still encountered a yellow quilt for the first time, and I felt unclean; the carpet was black, and it felt dirty.The environment is okay, at least there is a yard."
1,"不错,就是院子小了一些,到海滩需要走一段端小路,奇怪的是青岛所有酒店都没有自己的海滩","Yes, the yard is a bit smaller. You need to take a section of the path when you go to the beach. Strangely, all hotels in Qingdao do not have your own beach."
1,属于别墅型的酒店，这点倒是非常特别，只是可惜门口那条道是单行道，所以出行未免有点不太方便，地形有坡度也挺有意思，里面环境非常不错，我比较喜欢这种清净的感觉，我入住的是最里面的那幢，后面就可以看的到园子什么的，感觉有点世外桃源的味道，隔着大玻璃有种2个世界的感觉。大床是黄色的，挺温暖的感觉，比较喜欢他们里面的多功能控制器，没事我就放点音乐听听，选的音乐也是那种很舒服的音乐，挺温馨，而且房间里的消费也很平价，性价比很高的一个酒店了~~,"This is a villa -type hotel. This is very special, but it is a pity that the road at the door is a one -way road, so travel is a bit not convenient, the terrain has a very interesting slope, the environment is very good. I prefer this clean feeling.I stayed in the innermost one, and I could see the garden or something later. I felt a bit of a scent of peach source. It feels like 2 worlds across the large glass.The big bed is yellow, it feels warm, and I like the multi -function controller in them. I put some music to listen to the music. The music I chose is also a very comfortable music. It is very warm, and the consumption in the room is also consumptionVery cheap and cost -effective hotel ~~"
1,"硬件不错，相对于223的房价，绝对性价比一流；但是软服务还有待改善，特别是有非正常情况发生时要多从客人角度考虑宾馆反馈2008年7月25日：首先,感谢您的宝贵意见.的确,因近期酒店新员工较多,在服务意识上还有待提高,需进一步加强培训,学会站在客人的角度换位思考问题.真诚的希望您下次再到我酒店来,感受一下我们酒店的其他房间,如健康单间,商务标间,豪单,豪标等.新华国际酒店期待您的再次光临.","The hardware is good. Compared with the 223 house prices, the absolute price is first -class; but the soft service needs to be improved, especially when there is a normal situation, consider the hotel's feedback on July 25, 2008: First of all, thank you for your valuable opinionsIndeed, because there are many new hotel employees in the near future, it still needs to be improved in terms of service consciousness. You need to further strengthen training and learn from the perspective of the guests to think about problems. I sincerely hope that you will come to my hotel next time to experience us.Other rooms in the hotel, such as health single rooms, business standard rooms, luxury orders, bids, etc. Xinhua International Hotel looks forward to your visit again."
1,328单人间的性价比还不错，市中心闹中取静，交通方便，对面就是招商银行，隔壁是红旗连锁超市。早餐也还丰富，但是有人在自顾自地拍卖国画，尽管没人理他们。承接会议较多，电梯比较繁忙，晚上睡觉还是安静的。总机对外来电话盘查严格，没有骚扰。虽然属于四星中一般的，但是看在价格和上述各个方面，蛮合算又舒适的。,"The cost performance of 328 single room is not bad. The city center is quiet and the traffic is convenient. On the opposite side is China Merchants Bank, and the next door is the Red Flag Chain Supermarket.Breakfast is also rich, but some people auctioned Chinese paintings, although no one cares about them.There are a lot of meetings, the elevator is busy, and sleeping at night is still quiet.The header's out -of -the --ware telephone inspection was strict, and there was no harassment.Although it belongs to the four stars, it is quite cost -effective and comfortable to see the price and the above aspects."
1,地理位置优越，前台服务速度还好。大床间的房屋很差，不能通风，采光也不好。客房内弥漫异味。夜间室外超重低音影响，电话骚扰，影响睡眠。另外，把角的房间内手机信号不好。,"The geographical location is superior, and the front desk service speed is good.The houses in the large bed are poor, cannot be ventilated, and the lighting is not good.The room is filled with odor.Night outdoor overweight bass effects, phone harassment, affecting sleep.In addition, the mobile phone signal in the corner's room is not good."
1,西郊公寓酒店的性价比高，强力推荐，今后去上海必住。酒店环境优雅，安静舒适，花园式宾馆，最大的优点世很安静。无有所值，服务好，感觉你不需要的时候很安静，需要的时候服务员就在身边。交通便捷，叫车容易，也可以让门童代叫。大堂虽然不大，但却非常精致，感觉比较温馨。前台登记结帐也快，问路、要地图服务态度也很好。在店内遇见的服务人员，基本都是笑脸相迎，跟客人打招呼。再次入住酒店时，前台小姐竟然还能认出我来，让我觉得很有面子哦。还有因为上次入住时曾经跟前台说过要无烟房，不要靠近电梯的，这次checkin的时候，我还没有说她们就主动跟我说安排了这种房间。服务依然还是那么周到，那么亲切，让人觉到了家的感觉！下次还住这里！房间符合商务要求。房间很宽敞，干净温馨，还有免费水果和小点心送，感觉很贴心！每个房间的配备很全，雨伞、文具用品什么的小物品都准备好了。房间的布置很有品味，标准间都一个样，房间清洁比较及时。服务很到位，像提出很多要双拖鞋什么的很快就送过来了。所有的房间都配了电脑，可以免费上网！爽！但酒店的电脑是虚拟硬盘，不能把文件直接存在硬盘里，不过后来发现有一个分区是可以保存文件的。这点觉得很方便。早餐丰富，品种丰富齐全。服务人员彬彬有礼，是家很不错的酒店。,"The cost -effectiveness of the Western Suburban Apartment Hotel is highly recommended, and I will live in Shanghai in the future.The hotel environment is elegant, quiet and comfortable, and the biggest advantage is very quiet.It is worthless, the service is good, it feels quiet when you are not needed, and the waiter is around when you need it.The transportation is convenient, and it is easy to call the car, and it can also make the door children call.Although the lobby is not large, it is very delicate and feels warm.The front desk is registered for checkout, and the attitude of asking the map and the map service is also very good.The service staff met in the store basically welcomed each other with a smile and greeted the guests.When I stayed in the hotel again, the lady at the front desk could still recognize me, making me feel very face.Also, because I said to the front desk for a smoke -free room when I stayed in the last stage, do not get close to the elevator. When I checkin, I did not say that they took the initiative to tell me that I arranged this room.The service is still so thoughtful, so kind that people feel the feeling of home!I still live here next time!The room meets business requirements.The room is spacious, clean and warm, as well as free fruits and small snacks. It feels very intimate!The equipment in each room is very complete, and small items for umbrellas and stationery products are ready.The layout of the room is very tasteful, the standard room is the same, and the room is cleaned in time.The service is in place, as if it is proposed that a lot of double slippers will be delivered soon.All rooms are equipped with computers, you can go online for free!Cool!However, the hotel's computer is a virtual hard disk. The file cannot be directly in the hard disk, but later it is found that there is a partition that can save the file.This is very convenient.Breakfast is rich and rich in varieties.The service staff is polite and is a very good hotel."
1,"酒店环境幽雅,安静舒适,交通便利,旁边就有高架口.房间里配有电脑,免费上网,还有免费水果送,爽!早餐也不错,品种丰富齐全.服务太度也很好.是家很不错的酒点.携程没有介绍错,下次到上海一定还住这家酒店.","The hotel environment is elegant, quiet and comfortable, and convenient to transport. There are viaducts next to it. The room is equipped with computers, free Internet access, and free fruits to send, cool breakfast! The breakfast is also good, the variety is rich and complete. The service is too good.Very good wine. Ctrip is not wrong. Next time I arrived in Shanghai, I will return to this hotel."

1,酒店距离九寨沟景区仅仅2公里，附近是各式各样的酒店和购物街区，出行很方便。服务素质很高，早餐品种丰富，性价比不错。,"The hotel is only 2 kilometers away from Jiuzhaigou Scenic Area. It is a variety of hotels and shopping districts nearby. It is very convenient to travel.The service quality is high, the breakfast variety is rich, and the cost performance is good."
1,酒店人员的服务相当好，几乎是有求必应，在得知我们飞机晚点后，一直派专人守在门口。由于给到我们的房间与我们的要求有出入，酒店人员立即想办法帮我们解决，听说是他们的财务经理把房间让给了我们，让我们很感动，房间的价钱贵了点，但物有所值，下次去九寨沟还住喜来登。这次汶川地震应该没有影响到他们吧，祝一切平安！,"The service of the hotel staff is quite good, and it is almost necessary to respond. After learning that our plane is late, he has been sent to the door.Since the room for our room and our requirements is different, the hotel staff immediately tried to help us solve it. I heard that their financial manager gave us the room to us.It is worth it, and next time I go to Jiuzhaigou, I still live in Sheraton.The Wenchuan earthquake should not affect them this time, I wish everything safe!"
1,酒店地理位置较偏，如无自驾车，不建议入住。酒店在装修设计规划方面并不能体现四星的标准，其实底子还是很不错的，却弄得有些蛮荒的感觉，如酒店主楼前后的草坪都未能很好的利用。酒店的服务员很滑稽，会用眼光注视客人，但却不会问好，那么还不如不注视。入住时，前台一位男生还在用扬州话聊电话，对客人不理不睬。房间的装修很单调，墙面上都是素色的墙纸。大面积的空处，却无一副装饰画，单调无比。特别是标间的21寸电视，实在小得有些搞笑。卫浴设施到都是科勒的，勉强过关。至于学经济型酒店的通透卫浴设计，相对四星酒店有些不伦不类吧。酒店的自助早餐，两天没有变换菜式，被好友不幸言中，呵呵。如果你不是一位苛刻的人，还是能接受这样的酒店的。只是离四星实在有些距离。哦，还有，酒店大厅进出的感应门，反应极端的迟钝，哈哈！,"The hotel's geographical location is relatively biased. If there is no self -driving, it is not recommended to check in.The hotel does not reflect the four -star standard in terms of decoration design planning. In fact, the foundation is still very good, but it feels a little deserted. For example, the lawn before and after the hotel's main building has not been used well.The hotel's waiter is funny and watched the guests with a vision, but it will not ask well, so it is better not to watch.During the check -in, a boy at the front desk was still talking to Yangzhou dialect to ignore the guests.The decoration of the room is very monotonous, with plain wallpaper on the wall.Large -area vacancy, there is no pair of decorative paintings, which is extremely monotonous.Especially the 21 -inch TV in the standard room is really small.The bathroom facilities are all Kohler's, barely passing the level.As for the transparent bathroom design of the Economic Hotel, it is a bit unscrupulous than the four -star hotel.The hotel's buffet breakfast has not changed the dishes for two days, and is unfortunately said by friends, huh.If you are not a harsh person, you can still accept such a hotel.It's just a bit away from the four -star.Oh, and the induction door of the hotel lobby is extremely slow in response, haha!"
1,房间一般，商务大床房间和浴室之间用玻璃墙隔开，装修还应该算是四星级酒店，电视机比较小而且国外的卫星频道只有CNN和BS2，停车场免费,The room is generally separated from a glass wall between the large business bed room and the bathroom. The decoration should be regarded as a four -star hotel. The TV is relatively small and the foreign satellite channels are only CNN and BS2. The parking lot is free.
1,"新装修的酒店,房间很新很好的,作为万豪的金卡会员,充分享受金卡的待遇,很好.早餐的品种不够丰富.","The newly renovated hotel, the room is very new and good. As a member of the Marriott Gold Card, you can fully enjoy the treatment of the Gold Card. It is good. The breed of breakfast is not rich enough."
1,网上定了个行政标间，还用信用卡担保的，到了后却被告知有客人没退房，改成了一般套间。但酒店还算可以，提供了免费上网和两个免费早餐。,"A administrative standard room was set on the Internet, and it was also guaranteed by a credit card. After that, it was told that some guests did not check out and changed to general suite.But the hotel is okay, providing free Internet access and two free breakfast."
1,"本人是比较喜欢这家酒店的,已是第二次入住.洲际位置很好,就在维多利亚海,星光大道旁边.房间和酒店的大堂面海都是落地大玻璃窗,窗外美景尽收眼底,特别到晚上更甚.就是房价不是个小数目,携程这次订的是包三晚2400不含早餐.如果不包三晚的话要3500这样一个晚上,我曾经住过.如果说不在乎银子的,应该这里是上上之选.","I prefer this hotel, and it is the second time to stay. The intercontinental location is very good. It is next to the Victoria Sea and Star Avenue.Especially at night, it is not a small number of house prices. Ctrip's booked for three nights 2400 for breakfast. If you do n’t include three nights, you need 3500 nights. I have lived.It should be the choice of the upper."
1,是非常不错的酒店，服务也很周到，赞赏香港人的服务意识。,"It is a very good hotel, and the service is also very thoughtful."
1,"总的感觉很不错,客房有22层左右,楼层很高可以看的更远,但是窗外没什么好看的,呵呵...服务嘛很好,随叫随到,我刚入住的时候就有服务员问我是不是要打扫房间,真的是很温馨,你需要什么服务客房部都会来帮你,不过有两点不行,首先就是电话费太贵了,1.7元每分钟,真的是太贵了,其次就是中央空调的问题,白天很好,制冷效果真的是很好很好,但是到了晚上特别是深夜居然会停了,害得我被热醒了,那个汗啊是真的多,所以希望酒店能考虑到每个客人的习惯问题不一样,如有从新启动或给空调加水,最好是选择中午的午饭时间或晚饭时间,人少的时候,晚上千万别关,因为每个人的睡眠习惯都不一样,一有不舒适就会醒的,所以希望能改正.","The general feeling is very good. The rooms have about 22 floors. The floor is very high to see, but there is nothing to look good outside the window, haha ... the service is good.Do I want to clean the room, it is really warm. You need any service rooms to help you, but there are two points. The first is that the telephone fee is too expensive. 1.7 yuan per minute.The second is the problem of the central air conditioner. It is very good during the day.The hotel can consider that the habit of each guest is different. If you start or add water from the air conditioner, it is best to choose noon lunch or dinner time. When there are few people, do not turn it off at night, because everyone's sleepThe habits are different, and they will wake up when they are uncomfortable, so I hope to correct it."
1,也许真是从三亚回来，觉得4星的标准真的差距很明显！酒店的房间很干净，就是设施有点陈旧了，很多地方看上去比较“烂”。提供的设施也很一般，没有什么亮点，中归中举，就是一个睡觉的地方！酒店位置很好，临街而且地处闹市，购物吃饭很方便！楼下的朋友们看好了：出了酒店往右边走，有一个菜市场的入口，进去最多走10步，在右手边有个小摊，卖海南粉的，那个人多的呀！全是本地人，相当好吃，价格便宜，就是环境一般，还得枪位子。菜市口有很多水果摊位，免费打包很便宜，芒果才1。5一斤，我吃了好多！,"Perhaps it is really back from Sanya, and the standard of 4 stars is really obvious!The hotel's room is very clean, that is, the facilities are a bit old, and many places look ""rotten"".The facilities provided are also very average. There are no highlights.The hotel location is very good. It is located on the street and is located in a downtown. It is very convenient to shop and eat!The friends downstairs were optimistic: I went out of the hotel and walked to the right. There was an entrance to the market. I went in 10 steps and had a small stall on the right hand to sell Hainan Fan.It is all locals, which is quite delicious. The price is cheap, that is, the environment is average, and there are guns.There are a lot of fruit booths in the market. It is cheap for packaging for free. Mango is only 1.5 pound. I ate a lot!"
1,环境还不错，服务也还可以。环境比隔壁香格里拉也差不多，但是就便宜了许多。想游泳，但是被告知泳池在装修不开放，比较郁闷。前台小姐们比较吝啬自己的笑容。一次乘马自达到达的，门口没受到什么服务；一次乘进口奥迪到达的，就有人帮搬行李下车了。没人帮送行李去房间，估计看我们是中国人，没小费吧。难道要我去学两句日文？可是我不想学啊。在二楼西餐厅吃饭和一楼大堂吧喝茶的时候，看到里面很多打扮妖艳说话口音各不同的女孩子，希望我是猜错了……如果我没猜错，和她们在一个地方吃饭不太舒服。,"The environment is not bad, and the service is okay.The environment is similar to that of Richella next door, but it is much cheaper.Want to swim, but the pool was told that the pool was not open in the decoration and was more depressed.The ladies of the front desk are more smug.At one time, he did not receive any service at the door; when he arrived at the import of Audi, someone helped get out of his luggage and got out of the car.No one will help the luggage to the room, it is estimated that we are Chinese, there is no tip.Do you want me to learn two sentences in Japanese?But I don't want to learn.When eating on the second floor western restaurant and drinking tea on the first floor of the lobby, I saw a lot of girls who dressed up with different speaking accents in it. I hope I guess it wrong ... If I didn’t guess, I ate in one place with them.Not too comfortable."
1,我入住的是单人间（大床）。房间和洗手间不是很大，但一个人完全够用、好用；比较干净、整齐，上网是免费的（计算机需自备）；位于市中心的酒店有这个价位是很不错的，能含早餐就更好。,"I stay in a single room (big bed).The room and the toilet are not very large, but a person is completely enough and easy to use; it is clean and neat, and the Internet is free (computer needs to be brought by itself); hotels located in the city center are very good at this price.better."
1,如同大家所说的，整个宾馆有一股霉味，估计是地毯和不密闭不能开窗的问题，如果对房间气味有要求的网友绝对不要入住此酒店。不过该酒店位于海口市中心，购物较方便。,"As everyone said, the entire hotel has a moldy smell, which is estimated to be the problem of carpets and non -closed windows. If netizens who have requirements for the smell of the room, do not stay in this hotel.However, the hotel is located in the center of Haikou, which is more convenient to shop."
1,入住的是商务大床房，是最贵的房型了。但一打开门，天，温差起码15度！房间里竟然是壁挂空调！因为只是晚上去休息，早上出门时想了想，还是把空调全关了。,"Checking in a large business bed room, it is the most expensive room type.But when the door is opened, the sky, the temperature difference is at least 15 degrees!The room turned out to be a wall -mounted air conditioner!Because I just went to rest in the evening, I thought about it when I went out in the morning, and I still closed the air conditioner."
1,"地点很好,到新天地酒吧街或恒隆广场打车十几块,前台招待态度还好,大堂很漂亮,房间里还送了水果和小吃,还可以免费停车.不足的地方就是房间不是很大,窗户对面是一个小学,没什么风景可言.由于A座装修的原因,包括花园整个儿都被围了起来,所以根本看不到携程照片上的大房子.酒店大堂对着一条小窄道儿,有失别墅的气派.希望以后会漂亮起来.","The location is very good. Go to Xintiandi Bar Street or Hang Lung Plaza for a dozen pieces. The front desk entertainment attitude is good. The lobby is very beautiful. There are also fruits and snacks in the room. You can also park freely.Opposite is a primary school, there is no scenery at all. Due to the reasons for the decoration of seat A, including the entire garden, the entire house is surrounded, so you can't see the big house in the photo of Ctrip.The Qi faction of losing the villa. I hope it will be beautiful in the future."
1,房间不算大，中规中矩。北方的服务就真的不敢恭维了，CHECK-IN后都没有服务生帮你拿行李到房间去。周围都是酒店没啥逛的，自己吃早饭可以去万豪和喜来登之间那条路的永和豆浆店，很便宜。,"The room is not large and satisfactory.The northern service really dare not compliment. After check-in, there is no waiter to help you get your luggage to the room.There are no hotels around the hotel. You can go to the Yonghe Soymilk shop between Marriott and Sheraton for breakfast. It is very cheap."
1,总体不错的酒店，楼宇结构有点怪。携程订单下了，可是酒店内部协调慢，抵达后等了很久才拿到前台；前台男服务员很差，阴阳怪气的。一楼有不少大牌子奢侈品店早九到晚九，不错的，没事的时候可以逛逛。早餐尚好，勉强过关，比三亚喜来登差了n倍，当然，价格差没差那么多。,"The overall hotel, the building structure is a bit strange.Ctrip's order is off, but the hotel is slow in harmony. After arriving for a long time, I got the front desk; the front desk men's waiters were very poor, and yin and yang were strange.There are many big brands on the first floor of the luxury stores from nine to nine in the morning, good, you can go shopping when it's okay.The breakfast is still good, and the barrier is barely passed. It is N times worse than Sanya Sheraton. Of course, the price difference is not so much."
1,入住喜来登前电话咨询过一些问题，礼宾部的ke接待不但接待了我，而且还为我的沈阳之行进行细致的安排并在前台留下了信息。在这里再次感谢。入住之后的感觉也很好。就是房间的排风扇声音太大，影响睡眠！,"I have been in Xichao to consult with some questions. The KE reception of the Rulin Department not only received me, but also made detailed arrangements for my Shenyang trip and left information on the front desk.Thank you again here.It feels good after check -in.That is, the sound of the fan in the room is too loud, affecting sleep!"
1,"环境不错,但服务速度稍慢。希望服务人员脸上多带些笑容。","The environment is good, but the service speed is slightly slower.I hope the service staff has more smiles on the face."
1,"酒店位置不错,房间设施太旧,早餐还好.总体感觉一般","The hotel location is good, the room facilities are too old, breakfast is okay. Generally, it feels average"
1,经济实惠，房间毛巾不够白，千万要住8层以上，4层的KTV太吵了！,"Economic and affordable, the room towels are not white enough. You must live more than 8 floors, and the 4 -story KTV is too noisy!"
1,地理位置虽说很市中心，但出入除了打的外其它交通都不是很方便。离万象城相当近。,"Although the geographical location is very centered on the center, other traffic except for other transportation is not very convenient.It's close to Vientiane City."
1,4年前住过，我和德国同事都觉得很不错。今年我又选了豪门，还是觉得很好。自助餐品种丰富，房间宽敞大气，宽带速度很快。一个字：值！,"I lived 4 years ago, and my German colleagues and I felt very good.I chose the giants again this year, and I still feel good.The buffet varieties are rich, the rooms are spacious, and the broadband speed is fast.One word: value!"
1,豪门对过生日的客人还是很不错的，有11朵玫瑰，还有一瓶圣彼得堡干红，那张有着很多工作人员签名的贺卡会让你觉得温馨。,The giants are still very good for the guests who are birthdays. There are 11 roses and a bottle of St. Petersburg. The greeting card with many staff members will make you feel warm.
1,广交会期间没有免费饮料吧了，没有免费长途电话了，可还是想来住~~不过，广交会结束了以后还是没有恢复之前635送100元代金券，饮料吧免费，及免费长途电话的服务，有点想不通。有段日子没去了。,"There is no free drink during the Canton Fair, there is no free long -distance phone call, but I still want to live ~~ However, after the Canton Fair ended, there was no recovery of 635 to get 100 yuan vouchers, free drink bar, and free long -distance call services.Not through.I haven't gone for a while."
1,住来住去还是最想念豪门。尤其是他们对待常客的优惠态度，check-in的时候不用押预售权，不用证件，就可以办妥。时间快得很。,"I still miss the giants the most.Especially when they treat frequent guests, they do not need to bind the pre-sale rights when check-in, and they can do it without documents.Time faster."
1,第二次入住了，感觉不错，健身房，游泳池都很好。但这次入住有点小问题，早上六点的时候，有服务员莫名其妙开门进来，然后又出去了，几分钟后又进来，问是否退房，晕！当晚给我房间送了份鲜花算是道歉吧，让人感觉还不错！另外，他家按摩的金师傅水平确实可以，强烈推荐！,"The second time to stay, it feels good, the gym, the swimming pool is very good.But this time there was a little problem. At 6 o'clock in the morning, some waiters opened the door inexplicably, and then went out again. After a few minutes, they came in and asked if they were checking out and dizzy!I gave me a flower to my room that night, which is a good apology, it makes people feel pretty good!In addition, the level of Master Jin, the massage of his family, is indeed possible, highly recommended!"
1,"酒店服务还不错,在宜宾已经很好了.但是携程的价格一点都没有,豪标B在前台打折价265,携程263,希望以后携程要大大改进价格偏偏高的问题,才能有吸引了!!!","The hotel service is not bad, and it is already very good in Yibin. But the price of Ctrip is not at all. The discount price of Haobiao B at the front desk is 265, Ctrip 263, I hope that Ctrip will greatly improve the problem of high prices in the future, so that it can be attracted !!"""
1,酒店挂牌2星，但确实不错，物超所值，在市中心，交通方便，出门做三轮车很方便，但对自架车的就不太方便，没有停车场。,"The hotel is listed on 2 stars, but it is really good. It is worthy of money. It is convenient to travel in the city center. It is convenient to go out to do tricycles, but it is not convenient for the self -ranging car. There is no parking lot."
1,宜宾这个城市给人感觉脏、乱、小，但是宜宾大酒店却给人相对豪华的享受，比起同城的另外两家4星酒店条件要好很多，不过还是有不足，例如电梯运行慢，停车不方便，进酒店的通道太隐蔽（没去过的不容易找到）。,"The city of Yibin feels dirty, chaotic, and small, but the Yibin Hotel gives people a relatively luxurious enjoyment. It is much better than the two other 4 -star hotels in the same city, but it is still inadequate. For example, the elevator runs slower.Convenient, the passage of entering the hotel is too hidden (it is not easy to find if you haven't been to)."
1,除了交通稍微有不便出入都要靠taxi或自有汽外其他方面都ok也很合理,It is also reasonable to rely on TAXI or other aspects of the auto except for a little inconvenience to enter and exit.
1,硬件很好，我的外国朋友很满意，就是房价分类比较复杂。,"The hardware is very good. My foreign friends are very satisfied, that is, the classification of house prices is more complicated."
1,这年头居然宽带还要收费，发了2封邮件用掉80多元，有点想钱想疯的感觉。酒店房间一般，就这样子，交通还算便利。唯一好的是自助餐厅，去的时候真好半价，性价比较高总之，我不会住第2次,"This year, I actually had to charge the broadband. I sent 2 emails for more than 80 yuan.The hotel room is average. That's it. The traffic is prevented.The only good thing is the buffet restaurant. It is really half price when I go."
1,"很好,服务很好,环境很好,价格也还不错,很满意","Very good, good service, good environment, good price, very satisfied"
1,"总体来说还是可以的,我住过很多次,最主要吸引人的地方是每天可以打3个小时的长途或者市内电话,电视机破了点,希望可以更换.",Overall it is okay. I have lived many times. The most important part of the most attractive thing is that you can make 3 hours of long -distance or in -city telephones every day. The TV is broken. I hope to change it. I hope it can be replaced.
1,除了部分设施有点老之外，是很好的酒店。尤其是服务很到位！餐厅的服务员点错了菜，导致结账多了50多元，不用一分钟就立刻改正解决，很好！！,"Except for some facilities a bit old, it is a good hotel.Especially the service is in place!The waiter in the restaurant ordered the wrong dish, which caused more than 50 yuan more at the checkout. It would be good immediately without a minute!Intersection"
1,我入住的是商务大床间，性价比很高，房间还有液晶电脑，可以免费上网，服务比较人性化，晚上免费送的果盘，而且在床头放了一枝鲜花，感觉比较温馨，房间各种小吃饮料一应俱全，美中不足的是家具有点陈旧~~~,I stay in a large business bed with a high cost performance. There are LCD computers in the room. You can access the Internet for free. The service is more humane. The fruit disk is delivered for free at night.Snacks and drinks are all available.
1,不错的酒店。每次去泉州都住的。早餐很丰盛。门口有大巴车站，交通方便。（但是大巴是中旅的，习惯很差，喜欢在市区兜来兜去到处接客，从一个站到另一个站，非常耽误时间。商务客人最好去中心站坐车）,"Good hotel.Every time I go to Quanzhou, I live.Breakfast is rich.There is a bus station at the door, which is convenient for transportation.(But the bus is from China Travel, and is very used to poor habits. I like to pick up customers everywhere in the urban area. From one station to another, it is very delayed. Business guests are best to go to the central station to take a car)"
1,房间还不错，装修看起来很舒服。但是商务间电脑由病毒，上网很不爽。晚上会有骚扰电话,"The room is not bad, and the decoration looks comfortable.However, the computer is virus, and it is very upset to surf the Internet.There will be harassing calls at night"
1,酒店设施很陈旧（预定时携程网是提醒过的），卫生也一般，与四星标准有些不般配；房间钥匙是查卡（芯片）式，由于用的时间长了，接触不良，经常开不开门，连服务员也要连试几次开行，很不方便。,"The hotel facilities are very old (Ctrip.com has been reminded), and the hygiene is also average, which is a bit uncomfortable with the four -star standard; the key to the room is Chaka (chip).Opening the door, it is inconvenient to even try to conduct a few times."
1,按四星级宾馆看，房间的价格比还可以，不过这个宾馆的价格是经常变得，要住的话一定要先上网看看，现在价格是多少。后面来的人，尤其是通过携程订房的人，一定要注意不要住在每一层楼的01号房间，因为有宾馆通风机就在墙外，从早上到晚上8点左右，噪音一直很大。凡是携程订的房间，有可能的话一定会安排在01号。再者，我在此宾馆5年住了近十次，是在佩服它的早餐，居然数年不变，总是那么几个，呜呼！人作一件事容易，不容易的是坚持数年不变！宾馆反馈2008年5月19日：尊敬的宾客，您好！十分感谢您五年来对酒店的大力支持，并在百忙中向我们提出了宝贵意见和建议。酒店一直在不懈努力地为宾客提供优质、完善的服务。为了回馈广大支持我们的客户，酒店特别在周日至周二推出客房优惠价格供宾客们选择，我们会尽量满足客人的需求，安排宾客入住自己喜好的房型。酒店每一楼层的01号房间为大床房，酒店开业初期，由于外立面的设计要求，01号房间的窗户为封闭式，存在着一定的“缺憾”。为了给宾客提供更舒适的住宿环境，酒店对这些房间的窗户进行了开窗改造，室内空气有了很大的改善，目前房间已拥有良好的通风环境。酒店的自助早餐也一直在寻求变化，我们会根据不同的季节和客人的口味进行变换。现在酒店早餐拥有六大类，近五十个品种，近期还特别增加了精致加工的粗粮及清凉甜品，欢迎您再来品尝，更希望能够再次得到您的指点，谢谢。,"According to the four -star hotel, the price of the room is okay, but the price of this hotel is often changed. If you want to live, you must go online first. What is the current price?People who come later, especially those who book through Ctrip, must be careful not to live in Room 01 on each floor, because there is a hotel ventilator outside the wall. From the morning to about 8 o'clock in the evening, the noise has been very large.EssenceAnyone ordered by Ctrip may be arranged on No. 01 if it is possible.Furthermore, I have lived nearly ten times in this hotel for 5 years. I admire its breakfast. It has been unchanged for several years. There are always a few, oh!It is easy for people to do one thing. It is not easy to persist for several years!Hotel feedback on May 19, 2008: Dear guests, hello!Thank you very much for your strong support for the hotel over the past five years, and put forward valuable opinions and suggestions to us in your busy busyness.The hotel has always worked unremittingly to provide guests with high -quality and perfect services.In order to give back to the majority of customers who support us, the hotel launched a preferential price of guest rooms on Sunday to Tuesday for guests to choose. We will try to meet the needs of customers and arrange guests to stay in their preferences.Room 01 on each floor of the hotel is a large bed room. In the early days of the hotel's opening, due to the design requirements of the facade, the window of Room 01 was closed, and there was a certain ""regret"".In order to provide guests with a more comfortable accommodation environment, the hotel has opened windows for windows of the windows of these rooms. The indoor air has greatly improved. At present, the room has a good ventilation environment.The hotel's buffet breakfast has been seeking changes, and we will change according to different seasons and the tastes of guests.Now the hotel breakfast has six categories, nearly 50 varieties. Recently, the coarse grains and cool desserts of exquisite processing have been added. Welcome to taste it again. I hope to get your instructions again. Thank you."
1,房间还可以，床和枕头都蛮舒服的，就是靠马路有点吵。总的来说还可以吧，以后去还会继续住的。,"The room is okay, the beds and pillows are quite comfortable, that is, it is a bit noisy by the road.Overall, I will continue to live in the future."
1,环境一般，房间还可以！交通不是很方便，服务也是一般化！,"The environment is average, the room is okay!Transportation is not very convenient, and the service is generally!"
1,酒店的位置非常好，离西街真实零距离。。酒店是花园式的，有点感觉像在大观园。。。。湖景房的视野比较好，，看到山，看到水。。不足的地方就是前台的工作人员好像反应比较迟钝，，工作效率较低。。。,"The hotel's location is very good, and the real zero distance is from West Street.EssenceThe hotel is garden -style, which feels like it is in Grand View Garden.EssenceEssenceEssenceThe field of view of the lake view house is better. See the mountains and see the water.EssenceThe deficiencies are that the staff at the front desk seems to be relatively slow, and the work efficiency is low.EssenceEssence"
1,"房间装修很好,尤其是床垫,住起来很舒服.卫生也很好,很干净.服务还可以,结帐速度挺快的.酒店的位置也可以,交通还很方便.餐厅海鲜的品种有点少,朋友聚会也挺好的.最主要的是价格实惠!!呵呵!!!反正总体感觉还可以,在秦皇岛的三星级酒店来说,性价比还是很高的.推荐!!!","The room decoration is very good, especially the mattress, it is very comfortable to live. The hygiene is also very good, very clean. The service is okay, the checkout speed is very fast.Less, friends' party is also very good. The main thing is the affordable price !! Hehe !!! Anyway, it is OK. For a three -star hotel in Qinhuangdao, the cost performance is still very high. Recommended !!!"
1,这个酒店不太好找，因为不太有名。它的位置其实是在皇家酒店对面的左家庄东街上。因为它离国展很近才选择了它。,"This hotel is not easy to find because it is not famous.Its position is actually on Zuojiazhuang East Street opposite the Royal Hotel.Because it was very close to the National Exhibition, it chose it."
1,价格比较合理，位置及环境也不错．早餐虽然简单也还不错．,"The price is more reasonable, and the location and environment are also good.Although breakfast is simple and pretty."

1,酒店位置很好，在西街的街口。酒店内环境优美，就是自助早餐价格太贵，品种也不多。7月份住了3天，感觉挺好的。,"The hotel location is very good, on the streets of West Street.The environment in the hotel is beautiful, that is, the price of buffet breakfast is too expensive, and there are not many varieties.I lived in July for 3 days and felt very good."
1,"我是2.13入住的,感觉服务还是可以的,特别是行李员,比较热情.但是周边的环境不是很好,我们那次入住的山海房每天窗户外竟然都是隔壁停车场的人群,比较嘈杂.海滩因为接近公共停车场,非酒店游客非常多,影响心情.","I am in 2.13, and I feel that the service is still possible, especially the luggage, which is more enthusiastic. But the surrounding environment is not very good. The mountains and sea houses we stayed at that time were crowds outside the parking lot outside the car. It was more noisy.Because the beach is close to the public parking lot, there are many non -hotel tourists, which affects the mood."
1,环球城大酒店整体来说还是比较满意哦！房间比较宽敞，有阳台，站在阳台吹吹风很舒服。价钱稍稍贵了些，早餐一般吧！我们住了二天，还好第二天早餐喜欢吃的鸡翼吃哈哈！打扫房间服务员态度挺好的，值得表扬。可是住在亚龙湾去海边很方便，可是去市区吃饭就稍远了些。补充点评2007年11月12日：入住酒店的人也不算太多，健身房是免费的，我们也去玩了一下哈哈！,"Global City Hotel is still more satisfied with!The room is relatively spacious and has a balcony. It is very comfortable to stand on the balcony.The price is slightly more expensive, breakfast is average!We lived for two days. Fortunately, the chicken wings you like to eat for breakfast the next day to eat haha!Cleaning the room waiter is very good and worthy of praise.But it is convenient to live in Yalong Bay to the beach, but it is a little farther to eat in the urban area.Supplementary comment on November 12, 2007: There are not too many people in the hotel. The gym is free. We also went to play haha!"
1,酒店背山面湖，地理位置优越，经营面积在当地算大，闹中有静，天然优势比较明显，看得出以往曾经有过一段辉煌的历史，但不知什么原因现在反而不舍得投入去做日常的维护和保养，各项设施比较破败，服务人员也少，服务质素一般，房费偏高，但就其地理位置的优越性而言，好象可替代的酒店不多，鉴于其地段和自然环境的优越性，所以下次去还是会选择入住。,"The hotel is behind the mountains and lakes, the geographical location is superior, the operating area is large in the local area, there is quiet in trouble, and the natural advantages are obvious. It can be seen that there has been a glorious history in the past.The maintenance and maintenance, the various facilities are relatively dilapidated, the service staff also has fewer service personnel, the service quality is general, and the house fee is high. However, as far as the superiority of its geographical location, it seems that there are not many alternative hotels. In view of its location and and and.The superiority of the natural environment, so I will choose to stay next time."
1,1-酒店地处偏僻，离海边很近（走路2分钟），且海水比北戴河和南戴河要干净，但是海边没有什么娱乐设施。2-我们是8月22日入住酒店的豪华间，房间室内设施一般较陈旧，因为楼层不高，阳台上会发现有蚂蚱一类的小生灵。卫生间的设施还不错。3-酒店的服务很好，有问必答，有求必应，而且员工们无论是哪一个岗位都很热情。饭菜也很不错，只是当天入住时海鲜的种类很少，但味道很可口也很精致。比起大排档来说要吃的舒服。4-周边没有什么超市和商铺，很清静，30元一位的卡拉OK，即便4个人也可以给你提供一间大的功能厅，超爽，只是音效略差一些。5-总体来说这个酒店从性价比上来讲是非常不错的了。,"1-The hotel is remote, which is very close to the seaside (walking for 2 minutes), and the seawater is cleaner than the Beidai River and Nan Daihe, but there is no entertainment facility by the seaside.2-We are in the luxury room in the hotel on August 22. The indoor facilities in the room are generally older than that of the old. Because the floor is not high, there will be small creatures such as grasshoppers on the balcony.The bathroom facilities are not bad.3-The hotel's service is very good, there is a question of answering, and it is necessary to respond, and the employees are very enthusiastic no matter which position.The meal is also very good, but there are very few types of seafood when they stay in the day, but the taste is very delicate and delicate.It is comfortable than the stalls.4-There are no supermarkets and shops around the surroundings. It is very quiet. 30 yuan per karaoke. Even if 4 people can provide you with a large functional hall, super cool, but the sound effect is slightly worse.5-Generally speaking, this hotel is very good in terms of cost performance."
1,整体感觉良好，我住的房间可以直接看到市政府大楼，出行比较方便，下次去威海还会住。,The overall feels good. I can see the municipal government building directly. The travel is more convenient. I will live in Weihai next time.
1,交通便利（轻轨曾家岩站就在酒店门口）、价格合理、环境闹中取静、服务设施齐全，值得推荐！就是淋浴花洒老旧，不好使，应更换。,"Convenient transportation (light rail Zengjiayan Station is at the entrance of the hotel), reasonable price, quiet environment, complete service facilities, and it is worth recommending!It is the old shower, it is not easy to make, you should replace it."
1,还不错的一家酒店，位置比价安静，房间也还不错，就是出门打车要走出一段距离。酒店商品部的服务很一般，态度极其冷淡，应该下岗。,"A good hotel, the location is quieter than the price, and the room is also good, that is, you have to go out for a while to take a taxi.The service department of the hotel's commodity is very average, and the attitude is extremely cold and should be laid off."
1,住在9楼，还能看到江景。不错。位置倒还一般。到机场30分钟，也不堵车，不过这个路程，在重庆却是不算近的了。就是结帐外卡不能用，与网上说的有点不符，也没什么明确的理由。,"Living on the 9th floor, you can also see Jiang Jing.good.The position is average.At the airport for 30 minutes, there is no traffic jam, but this journey is not close to Chongqing.That is, the out -of -the - -way card card cannot be used, which is a bit inconsistent with what they say on the Internet, and there is no clear reason."
1,客人反映不错.主要是靠近金融街和西单.商务谈判和购物都比较方便.,The guests report well. It is mainly close to Financial Street and Xidan. Business negotiations and shopping are more convenient.
1,"这个酒店值得推荐,地理位置真是好,中式庭院也很美.就是服务有待改进,住了两天没看到什么笑脸;因为手机充电器是英式插头无法充电,向前台借接线板,回答是没有,第一次在四星酒店听到这样的回答...总体来说硬件是不错的,设施或许不是很新,但是环境优势突出.","This hotel is worth recommending, the geographical location is really good, and the Chinese courtyard is also very beautiful. It is to be improved by the service. I haven't seen any smiley face for two days.No, the first time I heard such an answer at the Four Star Hotel ... In general, the hardware is good, the facilities may not be new, but the environmental advantages are prominent."
1,还不错，第一次来入住，总体印象好，交通也很便捷！,"Not bad, come to check in for the first time, the overall impression is good, and the transportation is very convenient!"
1,地理位置很好，离南京路只有大概五十米的距离．房间环境不错，价格也比较合理，在南京路那边还是有竞争力的．前台服务也很好．,"The geographical location is very good, only about 50 meters away from Nanjing Road.The room environment is good and the price is relatively reasonable. It is still competitive on Nanjing Road.The front desk service is also very good."
1,服务还是不错。房间有些陈旧了，周边最近最近在建楼稍稍有些不太爽，不过关上窗户也没什么影响。所处位置在成都算是不错的地方，而且接近民航售票中心，对于来回去机场很方便。,"The service is still good.The room is a bit old. Recently, the surrounding buildings are a little uncomfortable in building buildings recently, but it has no effect on closing the window.The location is a good place in Chengdu, and it is close to the Civil Aviation Ticket Center, which is convenient for going back to the airport."
1,总的来说都不错，我住了很久．ＰＳ：总台有个男接待员态度不是很好．．宾馆反馈2008年8月4日：尊敬的宾客您好！非常感谢您对酒店的意见和支持，我们会加强培训，努力为每一位客人营造一个家外之家，期待您的再次光临！,"Generally speaking, I have lived for a long time.PS: The attitude of a male receptionist in the main station is not very good...Hotel feedback on August 4, 2008: Dear guests!Thank you very much for your opinions and support for the hotel. We will strengthen training and strive to create a home outside the house for every guest. Looking forward to your visit again!"
1,说实话，这个地段，这个价格，的确很有性价比了。内装潢比大楼外部的马相要好很多。订的是特价大床房，可能是因为心理准备比较足，进了房间觉得房间除了小了点，其实还是不错的，房型虽小，但环境给人比较舒服的感觉。就是浴室。。。莲蓬头用起来。。。居然会侧面喷水出来，也不高兴电话总台了，就水开小一点，侧面也不喷水了，各么。。。忍了。。。床感觉不错，电视节目相对也比较丰富。总之，我和女友都比较满意，以后有机会在市区需要入住的，相信还是会选择瑞峰的。到底是舒适度+地段+性价比，是对的起这个价格的。宾馆反馈2008年8月4日：尊敬的宾客您好！非常感谢您对酒店的意见和支持，如您在酒店遇到任何困难和问题都可及时拨打总机和前台，我们会第一时间为你解决，期待您的再次光临.,"To be honest, this location, this price is indeed very cost -effective.The interior decoration is much better than the horses outside the building.The large -scale bedroom is booked. It may be because the psychological preparation is sufficient. When I enter the room, I feel that the room is a bit small. In fact, it is still good. Although the room type is small, the environment gives people a more comfortable feeling.It's the bathroom.EssenceEssenceThe shower head is used.EssenceEssenceActually spray water from the side, and I am not happy to have a telephone station.EssenceEssenceEndured.EssenceEssenceThe bed feels good, and the TV show is relatively rich.In short, my girlfriend and I are more satisfied. If I have the opportunity to stay in the urban area in the future, I believe I will choose Ruifeng.In the end, it is comfort+location+cost performance, which is the right price.Hotel feedback on August 4, 2008: Dear guests!Thank you very much for your opinions and support for the hotel. If you encounter any difficulties and problems in the hotel, you can dial the header and front desk in time. We will solve it for you as soon as possible and look forward to your visit again."
1,地理位置比较方便，环境还算不错，比较安静，房间也很干净！,"The geographical location is more convenient, the environment is pretty good, quieter, and the room is very clean!"
1,酒店房间，服务都不错，唯一不好的一点是，我住的348元的大床间，靠近延安西路高架路，噪音非常大，几乎无法入睡。宾馆反馈2008年6月19日：尊敬的客人您好，非常感谢您对酒店的支持和所提的宝贵意见，酒店除了348元的大床间以外还有多种其它房型可供您选择，在入住之时如您对房间有任何要求可向总台提出我们会第一时间为您解决，期待您的再次光临！,"The hotel room, the service is good. The only bad thing is that the big bed between 348 yuan I live is close to the elevated road of Yan'an West Road. The noise is very large and can hardly fall asleep.Hotel feedback on June 19, 2008: Dear guest, thank you very much for your support and your precious opinions mentioned. In addition to the 348 yuan large bed, there are many other room types to choose from.At the time of staying, if you have any requirements for the room, you can propose to the main station, we will solve it as soon as possible, and look forward to your visit again!"
1,地理位置比较方便，环境还算不错，比较安静，房间也很干净！宾馆反馈2008年6月19日：尊敬的客人您好，,"The geographical location is more convenient, the environment is pretty good, quieter, and the room is very clean!Hotel feedback on June 19, 2008: Dear guest, hello,"
1,建CTRIP提供更惠的格。我的客人均被告知，退房直接去前CHECKIN可得免早餐。一致要求我退房。有尬，也有的。宾馆反馈2008年4月9日：感谢您及您的朋友选择苏州雅戈尔富宫大酒店，您提出的问题引起了酒店的高度重视，我们会就此问题进行分析调查并作整改。给您带来的不便我们在此深表歉意，期待雅戈尔富宫大酒店能再次为您提供服务。,"Ctrip provides a more favorable grid.My guests were told that Checkin was free of breakfast before checking out.I asked me to check out.There are embarrassment and some.Hotel feedback on April 9, 2008: Thank you and your friends for choosing the Grand Hotel in the Suzhou Yagol Palace. The problems you raised have attracted great attention from the hotel. We will analyze and investigate this issue and make rectification.The inconvenience brought by you is here to apologize, looking forward to providing you with service again."
1,上次和携程反映过房价的问题后，现在的预定价格是280了，酒店还是那样，这次住的房间1320，可能由于在走廊的尽头，房间通风不是很好，房间里面有点味道，开了换气扇就好了，第一天晚上洗澡的时候，发现谁不热，就问客房服务，小姐说帮我查，后来登门向我道歉，说半小时后好，体现了优质的服务，过了半小时客房部又打来电话，说可能修好要比较晚，和我协商，送几瓶开水给我洗，电话挂了，就有个小伙子拎了3个热水瓶来了，我打开浴室龙头，发现水已经热了，就谢绝了，但是我觉得酒店的服务的确比较好，只是设施有点旧了，第二天热水没有问题。,"Last time with Ctrip reported the problem of house prices, the current scheduled price is 280. The hotel is still the same. This time the room I stayed at 1320 may be because at the end of the corridor.Just change the air fans. When I was bathing on the first night, I found that the room service was not hot. I asked the room service. The lady said to help me check it. LaterThe room department called again, saying that it might be relatively late. I negotiated with me and sent a few bottles of boiling water to wash me. When the phone hung up, there was a young man who took 3 hot water bottles.It was already hot, and it was declined, but I think the hotel's service is indeed better, but the facilities are a bit old, and there is no problem with hot water the next day."
1,好于预期。如果服务更好一店，价格更加合适一点的话，会更加有竞争力。,"Good than expected.If the service is better, the price is more suitable, it will be more competitive."
1,贵宾楼的房间还比较有档次。但是大床间里，机顶盒的信号奇差！浴室里没有浴缸，拖鞋质量不好，床上用品业一般。国际饭店的环境还是不错的，闹中取静。,"The rooms in the VIP building are relatively good.But in the large bed, the signal of the set -top box is strange!There is no bathtub in the bathroom, the quality of slippers is not good, and the bedding industry is average.The environment of the international hotel is still good, and the noise is quiet."
1,酒店还可以，就是性价比不高，要是便宜点就好了。,"The hotel is okay, but the cost performance is not high, if it is cheaper, it will be fine."
1,酒店的房间还是很舒服的。早餐蛮丰富的，但中餐厅价格贵，质量也不好，我们从进去吃饭到结账就我们一桌，没有别的人。酒店门口在修地铁，灰尘漫天飞。天津满街跑得是破夏利车，要找个干净的好点的车真的很难，酒店门口的车只跑远的长途，并且火车站那里的破车还要乱斩客，价格比奔驰车还贵。,"The hotel's room is still very comfortable.Breakfast is quite rich, but Chinese restaurants are expensive and the quality is not good. We have a table from entering to eat to checkout. There are no other people.The hotel's door was repairing the subway, and the dust was flying.It is really difficult to find a good and good car to run the Xiali car in Tianjin. It is really difficult to find a clean and better car. The car at the door of the hotel only runs a long distance, and the broken car at the train station has to cut off.The car is more expensive."
1,住了无数次了，中轨中距，差不多四星吧，也没什么太多可说的。上海的酒店都比较贵，徐家汇这里也没什么价位始终的了。其实，如果是旅游，大可以去旁边的天平宾馆，价格低了很多，离地铁站也不远，房间也没什么不好的。,"I have lived countless times, the mid -rail is in the middle, almost four stars, there is not much to say.Hotels in Shanghai are more expensive, and Xujiahui has no price here.In fact, if it is travel, you can go to the Tianping Hotel next to it. The price is much lower, not far from the subway station, and the room is not bad."
1,地理位置佳，交通方便，酒店服务、设施都不错，在郑州算好的酒店了，以后有机会去郑州还住裕达。,"Good geographical location, convenient transportation, good hotel services and facilities. The hotels that are good in Zhengzhou are in Zhengzhou. In the future, I have the opportunity to go to Zhengzhou to live in Yuda."
1,1、地理位置是有些难找，那条路叫“体育馆路”，不是“体育关路”。地铁5号线“天坛东门站”出来步行约15分钟，在一个较深的巷子底，建议在十字路口多设指路牌。离天坛很近，步行即可。2、房间虽小，但作为商务旅行住住也够了，装修八成新，比较干净。服务人员还是比较热情周到的。3、早餐品种太少，想吃点有北京特色的早餐也没有。,"1. The geographical location is a bit difficult to find. That road is called ""gymnasium road"", not ""sports closing roads"".Subway Line 5 ""Tiantan Dongmen Station"" is about 15 minutes walk. At a deeper alley, it is recommended to set up more street signs at the crossroads.It's close to the Temple, just walk.2. Although the room is small, it is enough to live as a business travel. The decoration is 80 % new and relatively clean.The service staff is still more enthusiastic and thoughtful.3. There are too few breakfast varieties, and there is no breakfast with Beijing characteristics."
1,房间干净，安静，陈设较新，服务员态度很好，交通也很方便，步行十分钟可以到达天坛，去北京火车站也有直达的公交车。就是2楼的餐厅菜的样式太少了，没有旁边的王府饭店菜肴物美价廉。,"The rooms are clean, quiet, furnishings are relatively new, the waiter attitude is very good, and the traffic is very convenient. You can reach the Temple of Heaven for ten minutes, and there are direct buses to Beijing Railway Station.That is, the restaurant dishes on the second floor are too small, and there is no cheap food for the Wangfu restaurant dishes."
1,非常好的酒店！1、环境安静2、硬件设施好、新3、服务热情、周到（如：房间的热水壶定期消毒、除垢）4、隔音好。不足之处：1、位置较偏，的士司机不知道，但出去酒店给联系车；2、早餐不好，品种太少总之性价比高、强烈推荐,"Very good hotel!1. Quiet environment 2. Good hardware facilities, new 3. Service enthusiasm, thoughtful (such as the hot kettle in the room regularly disinfection and dirt removal) 4. Good sound insulation.Disadvantages: 1. The location is relatively biased."
1,我这次住的是行政楼普通楼层的房间，请注意：行政楼也分行政楼层和普通楼层，这两者是有区别的，行政楼层是可以享受一系列服务的（在前台订要加500元）而普通的就什么也没有了。房间的设施不错，很舒适，洗手间尤其好可以边泡澡边欣赏外景（可惜我住的比较低，看不见外滩的风景）。还有值得称道的是它的自助早餐，东东很丰富很好吃，吃饱了中午饭都可以免了，就是比较贵（具体金额忘了）。它的SAP是上海目前唯一一家悦龙庄集团直属的SAP，我做的是1700元的（行政楼层打9折，还有附送的20分钟的足底按摩）我认为很超值，无论是环境、流程、手法、用料等各方面都非常棒，不比泰国的差，只是在房间里而已，强烈推荐各位有机会尝试一下。主要的不足是：1.去南京路没有想象的近，要走10多分钟。2.附近的商业设施不是很多，逛街不是很方便。3.电视频道不多，很多国内台都没有，不知为什么，值得酒店注意，有点不符合酒店的身份总体是一家值得住的酒店。,"I live in the rooms of the ordinary floor of the administrative building this time. Please note that the administrative building also divides the political floor and ordinary floors. The two are different.Yuan) The ordinary ones are nothing.The room's facilities are good and comfortable. The toilet is especially good to enjoy the outside scene while bathing (unfortunately I live a relatively low, I can't see the scenery of the Bund).There is also a commendable that its buffet breakfast. Dongdong is very rich and delicious. It can be exempted after lunch, that is, it is more expensive (the specific amount is forgotten).Its SAP is currently the only SAP directly under the Yue Longzhuang Group in Shanghai. What I do is 1700 yuan (10 % off the administrative floor, and the 20 -minute foot massage attached to it). I think it is great., Process, Methods, Materials, etc. are great in all aspects. It is not worse than Thailand. It is just in the room. It is strongly recommended that you have the opportunity to try it.The main shortcomings are: 1. There is no imagination to go to Nanjing Road, and it takes more than 10 minutes.2. There are not many commercial facilities nearby, and shopping is not very convenient.3. There are not many TV channels, and many domestic Taiwans are not. I do n’t know why. It is worth noting that the hotel is not in line with the hotel's identity. It is generally a worthwhile hotel."
1,酒店总体感觉不错，很适合外宾入住，大堂的氛围整个就像是一个外国人的社区。房间很舒服，携程搞活动，还加送了红酒和水果，很不错，下次还会考虑入住。只是停车场比较麻烦，来宾进停车场之前还要有狼狗绕车检查，感觉不舒服。,"The hotel is generally good, and it is very suitable for foreign guests. The atmosphere of the lobby is like a foreigner community.The room was very comfortable. Ctrip was engaged in activities, and red wine and fruits were added. It was very good. I will consider staying next time.It's just that the parking lot is more troublesome. Before the guests enter the parking lot, there are also wolf dogs to check the car. It feels uncomfortable."
1,非常不错的酒店，就是价钱太贵，如果以后遇到打折一定还会入住！,"The very good hotel is that the price is too expensive. If you encounter discounts in the future, you will definitely stay in!"
1,酒店服务非常好，比金茂君悦和浦东香格里拉的新楼都好，但价格却比他们便宜一点。服务员都训练有素，不管是餐厅，前台，礼宾，酒廊，Spa都能给人舒服的感觉。不足的是房间稍小，行政套房是用拉门隔开的洗手间、卧室、客厅，稍稍觉得拥挤。三层的悦榕spa不错，保留了一贯的悦榕水准，但是房间有点冷。,"The hotel service is very good. It is better than Jinmao Junyue and Shangri -La, Pudong, but the price is a bit cheaper than them.The waiters are well -trained. Whether it is a restaurant, front desk, concierge, lounge, SPA can give people a comfortable feeling.The disadvantage is that the room is slightly smaller, and the administrative suite is a toilet, bedroom, and living room separated by sliding doors, and feels crowded slightly.The three -layer Banyan SPA is good, retaining the consistent banyan level, but the room is a bit cold."
1,酒店地段好，设施高级，服务业不错，2楼有个意大利餐厅很不错的！,"The hotel location is good, the facilities are high -level, and the service industry is good. There is a Italian restaurant on the second floor!"
1,酒店非常的好，位子也还不错。楼上的餐厅可以看到很美的上海夜景非常喜欢，价格太高啦,"The hotel is very good and the seat is pretty good.The restaurant upstairs can see the beautiful Shanghai night view very much, the price is too high"
1,高级气派的酒店；前台、餐厅、酒吧、客房的服务也可以，服务生都很友善；位置好，离外滩很近；早餐还不错，品种比较丰富，但是没有什么特别好吃、给人留下难忘印象的食品。享受到了喜达屋会员的优惠，但是不知什么原因赚取的喜达屋会员积分却明显少于消费金额。携程送的礼物也是在索要之后才送达的，而且少了承诺中的精美巧克力一份，只有二楼酒吧的一份标准饮料券，是不是携程和酒店没有协调好呢？补充点评2007年10月13日：酒店员工对中国客人的服务还不错，没有碰到传说中的“现代的狗腿子”（看到别人在点评金茂君悦时提到过）。,"High -level hotels; the front desk, restaurants, bars, and guest rooms can also be available, and the waiters are very friendly; the location is good and close to the Bund; the breakfast is good, the variety is rich, but there is nothing particularly delicious and left to leave people.Unforgettable food.I enjoy the discounts of members of Starwood, but I do n’t know what the Starwood members earned for any reason are significantly less than the consumption amount.The gifts from Ctrip are also delivered after asking for demand, and there is one of the exquisite chocolates in the promise. Only a standard drink coupon on the second floor bar is not coordinated by Ctrip and hotels?Supplementary comment on October 13, 2007: The hotel employee's service to Chinese guests is pretty good, and he has not encountered the legendary ""modern dog legs"" (seeing others mentioned when reviewing Jin Mao Junyue)."
1,要好服务的酒店，椒江就这家了。帮客人晒衣服，服务贴心。海鲜味道也不错。,"To serve the hotel, Jiaojiang is just this.Help guests take clothes and serve intimately.Seafood tastes good."
1,房间不错，交通也很方便，早餐很丰盛，应该能够满足大部分人的要求，出门左手一直走就是江滨公园，下面就是海鲜城，可以好好品尝一下！,The room is good and the transportation is very convenient. The breakfast is very rich. It should be able to meet the requirements of most people. Going out of the left hand is always the Jiangbin Park. Below is seafood city. You can taste it!
1,看了前面的评价，觉得还是不错，所以选择了这家酒店。但是，住过很多酒店，裕达国贸是性价比比较差的一家。大厅很豪华，给人感觉不错，但是房间设施和服务只能说刚刚达到5星的标准，在郑州这个地方，这个价位属于很贵的了。而且看到房间里面放的宣传小册子，也只有763元（好像是，记不大清，但肯定差不多），是不含早餐，但有欢迎水果、免费桑拿、免费按摩等赠送，相比携程的698元，好像更有吸引力地说......补充点评2007年10月8日：想到早餐，补充一下，一百元一人真是很不值，没什么好吃的。,"After reading the previous evaluation, I felt good, so I chose this hotel.However, I have lived in many hotels, and Yuda International Trade is a relatively cost -effective family.The lobby is luxurious and feels good, but the room facilities and services can only be said to have just reached the standard of 5 stars. In Zhengzhou, this price is very expensive.And I saw the publicity bob that was placed in the room was only 763 yuan (it seems that it is not clear, but it must be almost the same), it does not include breakfast, but there are free fruits, free sauna, free massage, etc., compared to Ctrip, compared to Ctrip698 yuan, it seems to be more attractive ... Supplementary reviews on October 8, 2007: Thinking of breakfast, adding it, it is not worth a hundred yuan per person. It is not delicious."
1,"大床非常舒服,早餐很丰盛,前台业务不熟练,予授权搞错,耽误时间.","The big bed is very comfortable, the breakfast is very rich, the front desk business is not proficient, authorized to authorize the wrong, delay time."
1,房间隔音不好。网络环境还好。临街的房间比较吵。,The sound insulation is not good.The network environment is okay.The room facing the street is relatively noisy.
1,地理位置还不错，就是房间隔音比较差，性价比还可以了,"The geographical location is not bad, that is, the room sounds poorly, and the cost performance is okay"
1,酒店位置很好，交通也方便。电梯管理系统可能比较老，不支持单双层或高低层。每天早上电梯较忙，等待时间长。另外房间设施较老。宽带免费是优点，比较适合出差住。,"The hotel location is very good and the transportation is convenient.The elevator management system may be relatively old and do not support single -double or high and low.The elevator is busy every morning, waiting for a long time.In addition, the room facilities are older.Broadband free is the advantage, which is more suitable for business trips."
1,住了这里一周，感觉去张江这边公司很近且打车方便，房间和环境个人感觉还不错，如果要求不高，路对面的小店吃吃饭也可以，总体感觉不错!,"After living here for a week, I feel that going to Zhangjiang is very close and easy to take a taxi. The room and the environment are not bad. If the requirements are not high, the small shop across the road can eat and eat. The overall feels good!"
1,买了自驾游的度假产品，酒店挺大挺气派。不过说实在的酒店蛮偏僻的，如果自己没车还是不要考虑了。可能是因为周日入住，加上酒店地点不在市区，故酒店中冷冷清清的，晚饭也只有我们一台生意。服务生态度很好，只是要求要无烟房，但前台坚持说房间经过无烟处理后就没问题，结果还是有烟味。不过算了，只住一晚，就凑合了。,"I bought a vacation product for self -driving tour, and the hotel was quite elegant.But the real hotel is quite remote. If you do n’t have a car, do n’t consider it.It may be because it is staying on Sunday and the hotel location is not in the urban area. Therefore, the hotel is deserted in the hotel, and there is only one business in our dinner.The service ethics is very good, but it is required to have a smokeless house, but the front desk insists that the room is no problem after smoke -free treatment. As a result, there is still a smell of smoke.But forget it, just stay for one night, just make up."
1,第二次入住，酒店的花园比1月份来时漂亮多了，到处春意盎然。散步期间，鸟语花香，沁心醉人。上午在酒店小溪钓了半天的鱼，收获颇丰；下午去高尔夫训练场练了半天的球，腰酸背疼；晚间享受了酒店的桑拿和足浴堂促销套餐，精神气爽……，短途休假值得去。,"For the second time, the hotel's garden was much more beautiful than when it came in January, and spring was full of spring.During the walk, the birds were fragrant and intoxicated.I caught the fish for a long time in the hotel in the hotel, and the harvest was quite abundant; I went to the golf training ground for a long time in the afternoon, and the back pain was painful; I enjoyed the hotel's sauna and foot bath hall promotions in the evening.worth going."
1,因为是晚上入住，没看清整体外貌，不过感觉还行，很幽静，大堂很大，标间宽敞，家具不算很旧但是台面被茶杯烫的一个个白色斑点。卫生间干净热水很大，毛巾很白很干净。离金山风景区和天下第一泉景区很近，很方便。,"Because it was at night, I didn't see the overall appearance clearly, but it felt good, very quiet, the lobby was large, the standards were spacious, the furniture was not very old, but the table was hot on the table.The bathroom is very clean and hot water, and the towels are very white and clean.It is close to the Jinshan Scenic Area and the First Spring Scenic Area in the World, which is very convenient."
1,环境很好；房间一般，刚进去有点霉味；住1号楼底层，很安静；洗澡喷淋水量非常大；从宾馆去金山寺可以从金山寺的一泉路后门进去，就在宾馆门口不远。,"The environment is very good; the room is average, and it is a bit moldy when I just enter; the bottom floor of Building 1 is very quiet; bathing and spraying water are very large; from the hotel to Jinshan Temple, you can enter the back door of Yiquan Road in Jinshan Temple, not far from the hotel door."
1,"房间很大,设施很豪华,服务很好,668的价格.放在北京,同样的房间,估计要翻两到三倍的价格.建议订668不含早的房间,100的早餐,感觉不符实.两人住,双早,858,多花190,但是早餐真是一般.服务很好,退房时,竟然是一位小姐帮我拿箱子,实在感动,给了小费.","The room is very large, the facilities are luxurious, the service is very good, the price of 668. Put in Beijing, the same room, it is estimated that the price is two to three times. It is recommended to order 668 rooms that are not included in early, 100 breakfast, it feels like it does not match the real facts, it feels not true. The two live, double morning, 858, more spend 190, but breakfast is really average. The service is good. When checking out, it turned out to be a lady to help me get a box. It was really moved and gave a tip."
1,"环境不错,早饭的种类不多,宣传有健身,居然还要自己交钱的.其他都还好","The environment is good, there are not many types of breakfast."
1,不错，服务还是和以前一样。比较满意....补充点评2008年6月13日：贵宾楼层的豪华间比较旧了，不如楼下的豪华间装修，不过还是不错的，视野开阔，附加服务也比较到位！石家庄的酒店我还是觉得世贸是最的，呵呵。,"Yes, the service is the same as before.Satisfied .... Supplementary reviews June 13, 2008: The luxury rooms of the VIP floor are older. It is not as good as the luxury decoration downstairs, but it is still good. The vision is wide and the additional services are in place!I still think that the World Trade is the most in the hotel in Shijiazhuang, haha."
1,"房间内饰尚新,服务也比较好.稍感不便的地方是坐电梯的时候必须插入门卡.(虽然目的是为了客人的安全)但是实际上给客人造成的不便估计更大.从楼层到地下停车场需要到一层转换电梯.还有值得注意的是部分房间内部有和隔壁房间的门.这种房间隔音效果差.一般隔壁看电视,干什么事情的声音都能听见.如遇到这样的房间建议换房.","The interior of the room is still new, and the service is better. The place where it is a bit inconvenient is that when you take the elevator, you must insert the door card. (Although the purpose is for the safety of the guests), it is actually more inconvenient to the guests.The underground parking lot requires a conversion elevator on the first floor. There is also a door worth noting in the interior of some rooms and the room next door. This kind of room sound insulation is poor. Generally, watching TV next door, you can hear everything. If you encounter this,It is recommended to change the room in the room."
1,最后调整到新翼楼，是他们新装修的楼层。还算不错的，浴室面积很大，早餐比较丰富，但是挺贵的：）,"Finally, it was adjusted to the Xinyi Building. It was their newly renovated floor.It's not bad, the bathroom area is very large, breakfast is relatively expensive :)"
1,前台说话比较生硬，门童服务意识很好，跑大街上去帮着打出租车。硬件都很好，不愧曾经是国际连锁集团的酒店。,"The front desk is relatively stiff, and the awareness of Men's service is very good. He runs on the street to help go to a taxi.The hardware is very good, it is indeed a hotel of the international chain group."
1,酒店地理位置很好，对面就是石家庄最好的商店――先天下。贵宾楼层客房冰箱里的软饮是免费的，还可以享受酒店欢乐时光免费茶点和酒吧优惠等等。总之是物有所值的五星酒店：）,"The hotel has a good geographical location. Opposite is Shijiazhuang's best store -the world.The soft drinks in the refrigerator of the VIP floor are free, and you can also enjoy the free refreshment and bar discount of the hotel's happy time.In short, it is a five -star hotel with a valuable thing :)"
1,对这次携程网提供的世贸广场酒店很满意，服务态度一流，环境也不错，只有房间的装修感觉稍微久了点。补充点评2008年2月10日：要补充的是：我们这次住的是豪华套间，房间的电视稍微小了点，要是液晶的就好了。呵呵,"The World Trade Plaza Hotel provided by Ctrip.com is very satisfied with the service attitude, and the environment is good. Only the decoration of the room feels a little longer.Supplementary comment on February 10, 2008: What we want to add is: This time we live in luxury suite, and the TV's TV is slightly smaller, if it is LCD.hehe"
1,在石家庄是很好的酒店了，我住了个贵宾楼的豪华房，在最高楼，设备都很好。但是到了早上8点半听到很大的噪音，原来是楼顶的风机开始工作了，这个是唯一遗憾，以后还会选择这里但尽量避免最高层。工作人员态度也很好，这个是值得肯定的。,"It is a very good hotel in Shijiazhuang. I lived in a luxurious room of a VIP building. In the highest building, the equipment is very good.But at 8:30 in the morning, I heard a lot of noise. It turned out that the wind turbine on the top of the building began to work. This is the only regret. I will choose here but try to avoid the highest level.The staff attitude is also very good, which is worthy of recognition."
1,"石家庄最好的酒店,服务是非常不错的.硬件由于这个城市的原因,所以也没有办法挑什么,但是非常可惜,这个可是在省会的城市啊...省会的城市不应该这样吧,4星里面不如BESTWESTERN旗下的....","Shijiazhuang's best hotel, the service is very good. Because of the city's reasons, there is no way to pick anything, but it is a pity that this is a city in the provincial capital ...Not as good as BESTWESTERN ..."
1,房间设施尚可，不过我的房间空调好像坏了，因为天气不冷也不热，没有管它了。这个酒店离机场较近，210一晚，推荐。,"The room facilities are acceptable, but my room air conditioning seems to be broken, because the weather is not cold nor hot, and there is no control.This hotel is closer to the airport, 210 one night, recommended."
1,酒店离机场较近，方便，房间设施也不错，工作人员态度也挺好，但周边环境不是太好，靠街，比较吵闹。,"The hotel is close to the airport, convenient, the room facilities are also good, and the staff attitude is also very good, but the surrounding environment is not very good. It is more noisy."
1,住过几次东莞酒店，海悦的地理位置和早餐最棒，听说朋友说请来的厨师是有来头的，呵呵冲这个去的！,"After living in Dongguan Hotel, Haiyue's geographical location and breakfast are the best."
1,"本来住该酒店，我就不想住，上次我就特意去南京住了，但镇江没有像样的店，地理位置也就这家好点，我第一次住很不满意该酒店服务，入住手续办了15分钟，后来房间不满意，是套房，旧，贵，换房，不答应，说我用过该房间厕所（小解），又用腿压了下床，试床是否柔软，要给八十元钱，十分钟不到就要收我80元钱，就理论，不行，我就要退房要投诉，后来就给我换高配房房，新装修原价1080，（当时也有插曲，该房是我没有入住时看中的，但价格高于我的报销，大致710元，我让他便宜20元，不行，说什么也不行，说领导不同意，后来要退房要投诉就给我680元了，你说这不是有个字加个（贝）吗，与我理论的是大堂副哩）,不过这次我入住手续还是上次的女接待（记忆深刻阿）服务很快，服务较好，两分钟搞定，商务房房型旧，不过有电脑，原来第一次住过的房间就没有再便宜了，该房不是携程协议房但性价比高，就两间，所以上次没有办法评论，就是第一次住很不舒服，这次还可以。","I did n’t want to live in the hotel. I went to Nanjing to stay in Nanjing last time, but Zhenjiang did not have a decent shop, and the geographical location was better. I was dissatisfied with the hotel service for the first time.After 15 minutes, the room was dissatisfied. It was a suite, old, expensive, changed the house, and did not agree. I said that I had used the toilet of the room (small solution), and pressed the bed with my legs.80 yuan, I will collect me 80 yuan in less than ten minutes.The room was fancy when I didn't stay in, but the price was higher than my reimbursement, which was about 710 yuan. I asked him to be 20 yuan cheaper.It's 680 yuan, do you say that this is not a word and add (she), and the theoretical theory is the lobby mile), but this time I stayed in the last female reception (memory deep) serviceIt's better. It is done in two minutes. The business house type is old, but there are computers. The room that I lived for the first time was not cheaper. The house is not the Ctrip Agreement.It is the first time that I live in uncomfortable, this time it is okay."
1,"1.希望房间的改造加快进度,改造完房间不错,没有改造好的房间的确是三星的感觉.2.早餐很有特色,很不错.","1. I hope that the transformation of the room will accelerate the progress. After the room is good, the room is good. The room that does not be transformed is indeed the feeling of Samsung. 2. Breakfast is very distinctive and very good."
1,"再次入住该酒店,令我有种涣然一新的感觉,入住了新装修的房间感觉不错,服务也很好,早餐也比较丰富,下次我还是要住请水湾!","Checking into the hotel again, it makes me feel a new feeling. I feel good at staying in the newly renovated room, good service, and rich breakfast. Next time I still have to stay in Shuiwan!"
1,由于公事出差上海，经朋友介绍推荐了清水湾大酒店，抱着试一试的心态，预定了该酒店，一进酒店就感受到酒店服务人员的热情，房间的感觉蛮新的，也很安静，下次出差还会继续选择该酒店。,"Due to the business trip in Shanghai, I recommended the Qingshui Bay Hotel by a friend. With the mentality of trying it, I booked the hotel. As soon as I entered the hotel, I felt the enthusiasm of the hotel service staff.The next time you will continue to choose the hotel."
1,地段不错，靠金沙江路地铁和华师大，离中山公园也近，环境不错，预定的商务大床房，结果免费升级为套房，非常不错的套房，喜欢^_^下次还要入住。补充点评2007年11月4日：对了，补充一下，套房浴室没有淋浴，对我而言不太方便，那个电动浴缸好像也有些问题，没用成功，希望能改进。,"The location is good, relying on Jinshajiang Road Metro and Huadshi University, which is close to Zhongshan Park. The environment is good. The booked business large bed room is upgraded to a suite for free. It is very good suite. I like^_^I still have to stay next time.Supplementary comment on November 4, 2007: By the way, add, there is no shower in the suite bathroom, which is not convenient for me. The electric bathtub seems to have some problems. It is useless to succeed. I hope to improve it."
1,"很不错的饭店,在市中心,由于主干道很多地方限制左拐,所以开车去的一定要选择好路口.房间很干净,也很大,我住的豪华单人间,不错!床很大.早餐到是很一般,服务生很忙,把我的房卡和其他人的搞错了,害的两个人打不开房间.餐厅的服务员很好,我们晚上吃饭聊天一直到12点,他们就不下班,等我们,一点怨言都没有,也没有提出交我们提前结帐或者提前离开.总之够4星标准,不到500元的价格也可以接受.走的时候还送了餐卷,因为近期不会再去郑州出差,所以没拿,但是感觉不错...","Very good restaurant, in the center of the city, because many places in the main road are limited to the left turn, you must choose a good intersection when you drive. The room is very clean and very large. I live in a luxurious single room.It ’s very average. The waiter is very busy. I made a mistake in my room card and others. The two people who harmed could not open the room. The restaurant's waiter was very good.When we, we have no complaints at all, and we have not proposed to pay us to check out in advance or leave in advance.Go to Zhengzhou on a business trip, so I didn't take it, but I felt good ..."
1,酒店的硬软件都还好。每次预定房间时我都要求要无烟房/无烟层，但是每次到酒店check-in的时候都说没了，因为在住的客人延期不退房了。每次都那么巧？？？,"The hotel's hard software is okay.Every time I booked a room, I asked for a smokeless room/smoke-free floor, but every time I went to the hotel check-in, I said it was gone because the guests who lived were extended without checking out.Is it so coincidentally?IntersectionIntersection"
1,酒店的性价比偏低了一点，但总的而言设施各方面还可以，正门挺难找的我绕了好大个圈子，服务员热情度一般，checkin时门童看着你拖行李进去却无动于衷，也不帮忙拉门，和旁边貌似是值班的大堂经理相聊甚欢，checkout的时候的那个门童倒还可以主动帮你叫车搬行李了,"The cost -effectiveness of the hotel is a bit lower, but in general, all aspects of the facilities are OK. The main door is very difficult to find me around a large circle. The waiter's enthusiasm is average.Don't help pull the door, and talk about the lobby manager who seems to be on duty next to him. The door child when you checkout can also take the initiative to help you call the car to move your luggage."
1,"去之前看过点评,好象满差的，但似乎哈尔滨的5星级都满差的，于是只好选了它实际去住觉得还好印象最深的就是电梯特别特别地慢地理环境不错,出去有很多能逛的地方","I have seen the review before going, it seems that the ones are full, but it seems that the 5 -star Harbin's 5 -star is full, so I had to choose it to actually live. The most impressive thing is that the elevator is particularly slow and the geographical environment is good.Many places that can be strolled"
1,前台服务较好，对于未按照预订时间到达的客户，还能够保留预订，但是沟通技巧不是很好，上次住时没有用携程的预订，感到服务很好，所以这次用携程预订，但是感到两次服务不一样了。,"The front desk service is good. For customers who have not arrived at the reservation time, they can still retain the booking, but the communication skills are not very good. I did not use Ctrip's booking when I lived last time. I feel that the service is very good.Two services are different."
1,订购马可波罗假日酒店全是看朋友们的点评所致，所以，为了后来的朋友们方便，也要嗦几句！马可波罗假日酒店的服务可以说是四星中的典范。我订购的459特双床房(特惠)由于我到店较晚已经无房，免费升级到了豪华大床房，由于我带了孩子，还给免费提供了一张加床。服务员还不停地给我道歉，让我很不好意思!携程订房早餐按45一位，早餐品种不能算多，但每一样均很精致。侥幸得到了窗边座位，正可以一览西湖的全貌，让孩子十分过瘾！酒店位置很好，机场大巴落客点过来100m左右；步行到西湖10分钟多一点，知味观总店也在同一方向。在友好门口有自行车出租，一个小时内不收费，我们玩了6个小时，一部车子收费9元。很爽！缺点：就是宽带的收费，虽然只有20元／天，但让人凭添几分不快！呵呵，减分，也没必要吧！顺便说一句，马可波罗假日酒店门口的出租车也有绕路现象，去汽车西站故意绕黄龙体育中心！可能是杭州司机的通病！,"Ordering Marco Polo Holiday Hotel is caused by the comments from friends, so for the convenience of later friends, you have to say a few words!The service of the Marco Polo Holiday Hotel can be said to be a model of four stars.I ordered the 459 special double bed room (special) because I arrived at the store late and had no room, and it was upgraded to a luxurious large bed room for free. Since I brought the child, I also provided a free bed for free.The waiter kept apologizing to me, making me very embarrassed! Ctrip booking breakfast is 45, and there are many breakfast varieties, but each is exquisite.Fortunately, I got the seat by the window, which can see the whole picture of the West Lake, which makes the child very enjoyable!The hotel location is very good. The airport bus is about 100m; walking to West Lake for more than 10 minutes, Zhiweiguan's General Store is also in the same direction.There is a bicycle rental at the friendly door. Without charging within an hour, we played for 6 hours and a car charged 9 yuan.Very cool!Disadvantages: Broadband charges. Although it is only 20 yuan / day, it makes people add a bit!Haha, reduce points, it is not necessary!By the way, the taxi at the door of Marco Polo's Holiday Hotel also has a detour. Go to the West Railway Station to deliberately around Huanglong Sports Center!It may be a common problem for Hangzhou drivers!"
1,7月到杭州旅游，选择入住该酒店。环境较好，服务到位。定的是特惠的大床房，给免费升级了，升到啥不记得了，反正挺好的。这个月带孩子再次到杭州旅游，仍旧选择了该酒店。宾馆反馈2008年8月15日：非常感谢您对我们酒店服务的肯定。酒店会不断的努力，提升酒店品质，提高服务质量。衷心期待您的再次光临！,"When you travel to Hangzhou in July, choose to stay in the hotel.The environment is better and the service is in place.It is a special large bed room, which is upgraded for free.This month, I took my child to travel to Hangzhou again and still chose the hotel.Hotel feedback on August 15, 2008: Thank you very much for your affirmation of our hotel service.Hotels will continue to work hard to improve hotel quality and improve service quality.I sincerely look forward to your visit again!"
1,如果用一句话来点评：服务远远好过硬件。这次入住了行政湖景房和豪华商务房，感受比较多，就多说几句。入住当天虽然没有如约拿到双床房（可能入住人太多，说是还没有打扫好），但是前台安排了最高层的湖景房，补偿了一下。很少见的是每间房只提供单早，每次都要签单，稍微有点麻烦。不过早餐45一份，内容也挺丰富，还有小笼蒸的糕点，很喜欢。在酒店中餐厅消费可以打85折，价格很适中，即使人少也能提供包间，还不设最低消费，不错。离西湖确实比较近，慢慢散步十五分钟左右绝对可以达到。在湖景房或者17楼湖景餐厅还可以看到西湖喷泉、白堤，很享受。门童非常积极主动，除了热情招呼，还会主动询问是否需要拦出租车，知道我们要去机场，还告诉我们等车的位置以及可以在酒店大堂购买机场大巴的车票。客房服务很及时，需要什么东西都会尽快送到，打扫卫生迅速到令人吃惊，我们才一顿早餐的工夫，回来屋子已经收拾整齐。前台工作人员让我印象最深刻的是一名叫欣怡的姑娘，耐心、亲切，在我提出要定多一间房，想看看房后，她很快处理完自己手中的事陪我们前往，提供了很多有帮助的信息说到房间，这确实是唯一令我觉得与这间酒店很不太相称的地方。虽然我很欣赏客房设施的全面，免费提供的水果和饮料，卫生间里既有浴缸又有淋浴房的多种选择。但是，不得不说，设施实在是“太”陈旧了，旧的衣柜的门开闭都有吱吱嘎嘎的声响，还要往上提一提才能关严实。旧的马桶里的水阀的链子都是断的用绳子修补好的，结果还是一个劲儿的断，在我们自己维修过两次后，不得已求助客房服务，他们立刻通知工程部的维修人员，很快换上了新的带铁链的，接着即刻又有客房服务人员打扫干净，衔接的那么好，服务总是无可挑剔。中途加定的豪华客房据说是按照五星级标准装修的，不过装修的品位着实不怎么样，所以也不显得新到哪里去。（而且后来通过携程预定到的房比之前我们去看的房小了不少，也没有之前看到的组合沙发一块儿，不知道是不是因为通过携程预定会比直接在酒店预定少那么二三十块钱就缩水的缘故，想不明白，同是5-7层的豪华房，怎么大小，设备还有区别呢？）建议向皇冠假日酒店或者新开元酒店的设计风格学习学习。如果酒店能够重新装修一下，我想即使价格再高一点，我还是会选择马可波罗。宾馆反馈2008年8月9日：非常感谢您我们酒店中肯的点评。您加订的是商务豪华双床房，而您参观的是商务豪华大床房。由于房间格局的不同，商务豪华双床房内由带琴凳的单人沙发代替了组合沙发。同时我们酒店也在逐步对老楼层的设施设备做进一步的改进。您的建议对我们很重要，再次表示感谢！衷心期待您的再次光临！,"If you use a word to comment: the service is far better than the hardware.This time I stayed in the administrative lake view house and luxury business house, and I felt more, so I said a few more words.Although I did not get a double bed room on the day of the stay (maybe there were too many people who stayed in, it was said that it had not been cleaned up), but the highest -tier lake view room was arranged at the front desk to compensate for it.It is rare that each room only provides a single early, and it has to be signed every time, which is a bit troublesome.However, 45 breakfasts are rich in content, and there are cage steamed cakes. I like it very much.The consumption of restaurants in the hotel can be 85 % off, and the price is very moderate. Even if there are few people, it can provide a private room, and there is no minimum consumption.It is really closer to the West Lake, and it can be achieved for about fifteen minutes slowly.You can also see West Lake Fountain and Baidi in the lake view room or the 17th floor, and enjoy it.Mendong is very proactive. In addition to greeting enthusiastically, he will also actively ask if you need to stop a taxi. He knows that we are going to the airport, and also tells us the location of the car and the ticket that can buy the airport bus in the hotel lobby.The guest room service is very timely, and everything needs to be delivered as soon as possible. The cleaning of cleaning is so surprising that we only have a breakfast. The house is ready to come back.The front desk staff impressed me the most is a girl named Xin Yi, patient and kind. After I proposed to set more rooms, after looking at the room, she quickly handled what she had in my hands to accompany us to go.It provides a lot of helpful information about the room, which is indeed the only thing that makes me feel very incompatible with this hotel.Although I appreciate the comprehensiveness of guest room facilities, free fruits and beverages provided for free, in the bathroom, there are both bathtubs and many options for shower rooms.However, I have to say that the facilities are ""too"" and old. The door of the old wardrobe has a crunchy sound, and it must be mentioned up to be talked about.The chain of the water valve in the old toilet is repaired with a rope. As a result, it is still broken. After we have repaired it twice, we have to ask for the guest room service. They immediately notified the maintenance staff of the engineering department.I quickly put on the new iron chain, and then the guest room service staff was cleaned immediately. The connection was so good that the service was always impeccable.The luxury rooms that are added halfway are said to be decorated according to five -star standards, but the quality of the decoration is really not very good, so it does not seem to be new.(And later, the room scheduled by Ctrip was a lot smaller than the room we went to see before, and there was no combination sofa that we saw before.For ten dollars, I don't understand. I do n’t understand. It ’s the same as the 5-7-story luxury room. How is the size and the difference between the equipment?) It is recommended to learn from the design style of the Crown Holiday Hotel or the New Kaiyuan Hotel.If the hotel can renovate again, I think even if the price is higher, I will still choose Marco Polo.Hotel feedback on August 9, 2008: Thank you very much for your review.You booked a business luxury double bed, and you visit the large -scale business luxury bed room.Due to the different room pattern, the single -person sofa with a piano stool instead of the combined sofa in the business luxury double bed.At the same time, our hotel is gradually improving the facilities and equipment on the old floor.Your suggestion is important to us and thank you again!I sincerely look forward to your visit again!"
1,"酒店周围的环境不错,去景点都很方便.前台态度不错,入住和退房的速度很快.","The environment around the hotel is good, and the attractions are very convenient. The attitude of the front desk is good, and the speed of staying and checking out is very fast."
1,对比上趟住华美达海华，两家都是有些年头的饭店，但这里的感觉/服务/卫生远远超过华美达；对比索菲特西湖，虽然旧些，但员工培训和素质都远远超过；地点很好，酒店和周边餐厅很多，17楼的自助餐食物和西湖景观和服务都非常不错，住客还能打折，很好！推荐！宾馆反馈2008年8月7日：非常感谢您选择入住我们酒店。能获得您的鼓励和支持我们倍感荣幸。这也是对我们工作的最大鼓励。再一次感谢您的点评，衷心期待您的再次光临！,"Compared with the visit to Huameda Haihua, both are restaurants for some years, but the feeling/service/hygiene here is far more than Huameda; although the old is old, the employee training and quality are far far away.More than; the location is very good. There are many hotels and surrounding restaurants. The buffet food and West Lake landscape and services on the 17th floor are very good. Residents can also discount, very good!recommend!Hotel feedback on August 7, 2008: Thank you very much for choosing to stay in our hotel.We are honored to get your encouragement and support.This is also the biggest encouragement for our work.Thank you again for your comments. I sincerely look forward to your visit again!"
1,订的市景双床房，免费升级到豪华双床房，感觉很好。服务台工作人员耐心有礼貌，态度很好。房间情况：优点：卫生间较宽敞，干净，力士的洗浴用品，环保好用。房间设施用品齐全，熨衣板、雨伞、文具都为客人想到了。空调冷气足，而且出风口比较干净，没有特殊的气味。床柔软，两个长枕一个方枕，看电视靠着很舒服。电视频道清晰。checkin和checkout速度较快。缺点：房间设施比较陈旧，需要进行重新装修。房间有点小，像三星级规模。这里的服务确实很好，工作人员态度都很温和，面带微笑，将硬件上的稍许不足都弥补上了。以后还会考虑入住。宾馆反馈2008年8月5日：非常感谢您对我们酒店的点评。您对我们的肯定和支持，是我们工作的动力。酒店会不断的提升酒店的品质，提高宾客居住的舒适度，为宾客营造轻松、愉悦的旅居环境。酒店另有按高星级标准全新装修的商务豪华房，宽敞精美。建议您下次入住时，可以选择该房型。感谢您的宝贵意见，我们衷心期待您再次光临！,"The booked city scenery double bed room, free upgrade to luxury double bed, feels good.The staff of the service desk is patient and polite, and has a good attitude.Room conditions: Advantages: The bathroom is relatively spacious, clean, Lux's bath products, environmentally friendly and easy to use.The room facilities are complete, and the ironing boards, umbrellas, and stationery are thought to the guests.The air -conditioned air -conditioning, and the air outlet is relatively clean, without a special smell.The bed is soft, two long pillows and one square pillow, which is very comfortable watching TV.The TV channel is clear.Checkin and Checkout are fast.Disadvantages: The room facilities are relatively old and need to be renovated.The room is a bit small, like a three -star scale.The service here is really good.

1,整体服务不错，酒店的位置也不错，只需要走过两条街的路口就可以直接走到西湖旁边。我订的是特价大床房，checkin的时候酒店免费给我升级到了行政商务房间，感觉很不错，并且还送了一份水果和两罐饮料，非常贴心。宾馆反馈2008年8月5日：非常感谢您对我们酒店的点评。酒店会不断的努力，为客人营造轻松、愉悦的家庭氛围，为客人提供高效、规范、准确、快捷的高品质服务，打造精致的商务型酒店。衷心期待您的再次光临！,"The overall service is good, and the location of the hotel is also good. You only need to walk through the intersection of the two streets to go directly to the West Lake.I ordered a special large bed room. When I checkin, the hotel was upgraded to the administrative business room for free. It felt very good, and I also gave a fruit and two cans of drinks, which was very intimate.Hotel feedback on August 5, 2008: Thank you very much for your comment on our hotel.Hotels will continue to work hard to create a relaxed and pleasant family atmosphere for guests, provide guests with efficient, standardized, accurate, and fast high -quality services, and create exquisite business hotels.I sincerely look forward to your visit again!"
1,房间隔音不太好，但是整洁舒服，服务尤其满意,"The room is not sounding well, but it is neat and comfortable, and the service is particularly satisfactory."
1,帮助客户预订的，酒店的地理位置和设施都很好，购得上四星标准！,"For customers to book, the geographical location and facilities of the hotel are very good, and the four -star standards are purchased!"
1,"很不错的酒店,服务和设施都中规中矩.好象宽带有点慢.","Very good hotels, services and facilities are quite satisfactory. It seems that the broadband is a bit slow."
1,房间整体感觉不错，有家的感觉，但床比较小，而且给我们的房间阳台外面就是锅炉台，有一股味道。早餐一般，没有想象的好。酒店附近的环境不错，边上就是家乐福，购物吃饭都很方便。,"The overall room feels good. It feels like home, but the bed is relatively small, and it has a boiler platform outside the balcony of our room, with a taste.Breakfast is average, and there is no imagination.The environment near the hotel is good, there is a Carrefour on the side, it is very convenient to eat and eat."
1,房间宽敞，条件不错。周围环境也可以。周围无合适的公交车，出行需要用出租车。,"The room is spacious and the conditions are good.The surrounding environment is also fine.There are no suitable buses around, and a taxi needs to be used for travel."
1,酒店房间到是不错，就是位置稍远了些，但是酒店有免费的班车可以直接把客人送到地铁站方便客人出行，不过要提醒大家要看酒店班车的排班时间。,"The hotel room is good, that is, the location is slightly farther, but the hotel has a free shuttle bus to send guests directly to the subway station to facilitate guests to travel, but remind everyone to look at the rowing time of the hotel's bus."
1,服务周到，地理位置很好，无论是在环市东路、淘金路这一带逛街或者吃饭都很方便。而且在房间里上网是免费的。,The service is thoughtful and the geographical location is very good. It is convenient to go shopping or eating on the East Road and Gold Rush Road on the East Road of the City.And it is free to access the Internet in the room.
1,挺不错，价格好，房间也不错，交通也方便。值！,"It's good, the price is good, the room is also good, and the traffic is also convenient.value!"
1,2月春节时去住才288元，现在五一长假预定居然要388元，不知道这100元是酒店的原因还是携程的原因而大幅上涨？过节涨价的理由是不存在的，因为春节都没有涨价。,"It was only 288 yuan in the Spring Festival in February. Now the May Day holiday is scheduled to be 388 yuan. I do n’t know if the 100 yuan is the reason for the hotel or the reason for Ctrip?The reason for the increase in price increases does not exist, because there is no price increase in the Spring Festival."
1,"客房设施还是挺不错的，环境不错,服务也不错，就是早餐太烂;配套设施挺好的就是太偏了,交通不便，总觉得有点欠缺。","The room facilities are still very good, the environment is good, and the service is good, that is, the breakfast is too bad; the supporting facilities are good, it is too biased, the traffic is inconvenient, and it is always a bit lacking."
1,"地理位置很好,房间也比较舒适,只是携程的房间都是在有停车场的一面,而且还有个大烟囱,不是很爽.","The geographical location is very good, and the room is relatively comfortable. However, Ctrip's rooms are on the side of the parking lot, and there is a large chimney, which is not very cool."
1,早餐与价格有较大差距，服务也是平平．但在离店时，发生的一件事感到很温暖．回京后发现自己的白金脚链落在了客房，当晚２２：００致电给酒店的大堂经理，次日，就收到了快递回来的链子．很是感动．虽有开始提到的不尽人意，但暇不掩玉，再去大连应该还会考虑在此入住吧．并借此感谢为寄回失物的工作人员表示感谢．,"There is a large gap between breakfast and price, and the service is flat.But when I left the store, something happened very warm.After returning to Beijing, I found that my platinum akin chain fell in the guest room. At 22:00 that night, I called the lobby manager to the hotel. The next day, I received the chain returned from the courier.Very moved.Although there are unsatisfactory mentioning, but not to hide the jade, you should consider staying here to go to Dalian.Thanks to the staff who returned to the lost property, thank you."
1,总体还可以！但是网络太次了，对于商务出差的很受影响。公众网都很慢，别提公司的VPN帐户了，根本就是时断时续，而且只能收不能发！在大连头一次碰到这种事情！,"Overall!But the Internet is too much, which is very affected by business trips.The public network is very slow. Don't mention the company's VPN account.I first encountered such a thing in Dalian!"
1,我们入住那天，整个世德堂只有我们一家客人，夜晚红灯笼下的美景、安静的宅子，实在让人难忘。如果打算在同里住一晚的话，这地方是最好的推荐！闹中取静，美不胜收。,"On the day we stayed, there was only one of our guests in the entire Sendang Hall. The beautiful scenery and quiet house under the red lantern at night were really memorable.If you plan to live in the same night, this place is the best recommendation!Take quiet in the trouble and be beautiful."
1,宾馆像个小的园林。去的时候是初一，住的人少，又刚下了雪，环境格外幽静。房间挺大，室内摆设古色古香。东西挺全（除了被子不够），但空调旧了而且匹数不够，效果很不好。又加上是冬天，房门会漏风，晚上睡觉很冷。服务员看上去不太专业但还算热情。,"The hotel is like a small garden.When I went, there were fewer people who lived, and few people lived, and they just snowed, and the environment was particularly quiet.The room is quite large, and the room is antique.The things are quite comprehensive (except that the quilt is not enough), but the air conditioner is old and the number is not enough, and the effect is not good.In addition, in winter, the door will leak wind and sleep cold at night.The waiter looks very professional but enthusiastic."
1,一流的环境，在当地来说没有别的选择了，85分吧。,"The first -class environment has no other choice in the local area, 85 points."
1,"房间有特色服务不错新天地附近也就这家五星了，呵呵，没得选了房间太少，常订不到免费注册网站导航宾馆索引服务说明关于携程诚聘英才代理合作广告业务联系我们Copyright1999-2008,ctrip.com.allrightsreserved.","The room has a special service, which is good near Xintiandi. This is the five-star. Hehe, you have to choose too few rooms., ctrip.com.allrightsReserved."
1,总的来讲整个酒店的服务还不错，不能说是热情，但至少是非常职业的礼貌。看得出来老外也挺喜欢它，让我比较动容的是在酒店里面打国内长途和市内电话完全免费，宽带免费而且配置了无线。但是仍然存在问题：1.早餐是发现一只苍蝇飞来飞去，服务员当作没看见；2.浴缸掉了一小块瓷片，露出黑色的内芯，一开始我还以为是什么脏东西；3.申请了延迟退房，但是钥匙在12：00就不能使用了，十分不方便。,"In general, the service of the entire hotel is not bad. It cannot be said to be enthusiastic, but at least it is very professional polite.It can be seen that foreigners also like it very much. What makes me more moved is that playing domestic long -distance and city telephones in the hotel is completely free. Broadband free and wireless configuration.But there are still problems: 1. Breakfast is found to fly around, and the waiter is not seen; 2. A small piece of porcelain is dropped in the bathtub to expose the black core. At the beginning, I thought it was dirty things.; 3. Apply for a delayed check -up, but the key cannot be used at 12:00, which is very inconvenient."
1,在南通这种地级市，能有这样的宾馆，算是很不错的啦。有一些小的缺陷，但不会影响质量。,"It is very good to have such a prefecture -level city like such a prefecture -level city.There are some small flaws, but it will not affect quality."
1,酒店环境不错，早餐也还好，虽然是西餐厅，但也有些中餐，味道还不错。商务客房不是很大，但是功能较全。这次唯一觉得不太满意的是酒店的枕头不是很舒服。房间空调声音比较大。CheckOut也比较快，我只用了大概3分钟，效率还是蛮好的。下月可能还要去那边，还是会选择三德的。,"The hotel environment is good, and breakfast is also good. Although it is a western restaurant, there are some Chinese food, which tastes good.The business room is not very large, but the functions are more complete.The only thing that was not satisfied this time was that the hotel's pillow was not very comfortable.The sound of the room air conditioner is relatively loud.Checkout is also relatively fast. I only took about 3 minutes, and the efficiency was quite good.Maybe you will go there next month, you will still choose Sande."
1,从门面看硬件好像还能唬人，仔细看，房间的装修真不怎么样，服务比招待所强不了多少。下次不会再住了。,"Looking at the hardware from the facade, it seems to be bluffing. Looking closely, the decoration of the room is really not very good. The service is not much stronger than the guest house.I won't live again next time."
1,酒店整体还算不错，就是早餐券的购买方式太不合理，又贵，买了又不能退，最后被逼到酒店后的永和豆浆，携程可不可以为会员反映一下。,"The overall hotel is pretty good, that is, the purchase of breakfast coupons is too unreasonable and expensive. If you buy it, you ca n’t return. Finally, you are forced to the Yonghe soymilk after the hotel. Can Ctrip be reflected for the members."
1,本次入住的是2号楼，房间大，床也大，就是卫生间的隔音太差，抽水声，咳嗽声，特别是按门铃声仿佛就是在按你房间，水也小，不能在隔壁用水时同时用水。服务和早餐都不错，环境也好，山庄对面就是于谦祠，从八盘岭路走到花岗观鱼十分钟，但那人太多了。八盘岭路边上在建一个紫渲度假村，酒店还没建好，环境已建好了，喜安静的人可以进去沿着西里湖走走，很幽静，象个世外桃园。它门口的餐厅已营业，用餐和喝茶的环境非常优雅，当然价格也是成正比的。总的来说三台山庄是比较适合喜欢安静人士度假。补充点评2008年5月4日：门口餐厅指的是紫渲度假,"This time I stayed in Building 2, the room was large, and the bed was also large, that is, the sound insulation of the bathroom was too poor, the sound of pumping, the cough sound, especially the door bell, as if the room was pressed, the water was small, and the water could not be used next door.Use water at the same time.The service and breakfast are good and the environment is good. Opposite Yuqian Temple opposite the villa, from Banpanling Road to granite observation fish for ten minutes, but there are too many people.A purple rendering resort is built on the side of Banpanling Road. The hotel has not yet been built, and the environment has been built. People who are quiet can go in and walk along the West Lake. It is quiet, like a paradise Taoyuan.The restaurant at the door is open, and the environment for meals and tea drinking is very elegant, and of course the price is also proportional.Generally speaking, Santai Villa is more suitable for people who like quiet people for vacation.Supplementary comment on May 4, 2008: The restaurant at the door refers to purple rendering vacation"
1,388的房间比以前住过的420的商务房要小一些，环境真的很好，山庄的顶楼观看三台山的风景很惬意，附近有于谦祠，比较幽静，清明节那天入住的客人很多，但是晚上去地下一层的足浴中心却一个人也没有，山庄内的体检项目也很少有人去光顾，大概以单位接待为主。,"The room of 388 is smaller than the 420 commercial houses that I have lived before. The environment is really good. The scenery of the San Titan Mountain on the top floor of the villa is very pleasant. There are Yuqian Temple nearby, which is relatively quiet.At night, I did not go to the foot bath center on the ground floor alone. The medical examination items in the villa are rarely patronized, and the unit reception is the main."
1,这个山庄的环境真是不错，非常幽静。正好是雪后入住，大雪还未消融。雪后景色非常好，空气也很好。山庄可以租自行车，捷安特的，很新，又便宜。把车往酒店一停，租个自行车，满山兜兜，太舒服了。打的也很方便，旁边就是浙江宾馆，所以来往出租车很多。服务很好，门童和前台都很有礼貌，招呼热情。只是一点儿遗憾，游泳池没有开。房间设施有点儿陈旧，不过很干净，足够啦。表扬一下前台一位副理。退房时候，碰到一主客为了人家放炮仗把车窗炸坏了，就得理不饶人，在抓着那位副理骂人，很难听。我看那位女副理，很委屈，确很有涵养，不还口，一直在解释。那个客人有点儿过份。在这里表扬一下副理。总之，值得推荐。开了春，再来！,"The environment of this villa is really good and very quiet.It happened to be in the snow after the snow, and heavy snow was not melted.After snow, the scenery is very good and the air is also very good.The villa can rent a bicycle, Giant, very new and cheap.Taking the car to the hotel, rent a bicycle, and the mountains are so comfortable.It is also very convenient to fight. Next to the Zhejiang Hotel, there are a lot of taxis.The service is very good, the door children and the front desk are very polite and greeting enthusiasm.It was just a little regret that the swimming pool was not opened.The room facilities are a bit old, but it is clean and enough.Praise a deputy manager at the front desk.When I got out of the room, when I encountered the window of the main and guests that fired the window for others, it was unreasonable. It was difficult to hear the deputy the dear and cursing.I think the female deputy manager is very aggrieved, indeed very concentrated, not returning, and has been explaining.That guest is a bit too much.Praise the deputy manager here.In short, it is worth recommending.Open spring, come again!"
1,环境很好，正好大雪，雪景很美。服务不错，挺热情的。房间空调很足。早餐时有些品种底下熄火了，不够暖和。,"The environment is very good, just snow, the snow scene is beautiful.The service is good and enthusiastic.The room air conditioner is sufficient.Some varieties were off at breakfast, which was not warm enough."
1,"环境和服务都不错,环境幽雅.不要忘去4楼观景平台,可以看西湖全景.","The environment and services are good, the environment is elegant. Don't forget to go to the 4th floor viewing platform, you can see the panorama of the West Lake."
1,是在网上看过别人的点评才订的房间，总体感觉还是不错的，也许不是旅游旺季，所以人不多，服务态度很好，房间也特别大，感觉很舒服。,"I have seen the rooms that have been ordered on the Internet that they have been ordered. The overall feeling is still good. Perhaps it is not a peak tourist season, so there are not many people, the service attitude is very good, the room is particularly large, and it feels very comfortable."
1,房间很干净物超所值价格也蛮合理的还不错,The room is very clean and the value is worthy of the price and the price is quite reasonable and pretty good
1,感谢“携程”推荐的干净、舒适、无干扰、性价比特高（248元）的《云亭山庄》别墅套房。现在只记得周庄有“双桥”、陈逸飞、万三蹄，还有在镇上农家餐馆吃坏的肚子。相比“云亭山庄”的晚餐非常可口，不错。,"Thanks to the ""Yunding Villa"" villa suite that ""Ctrip"" is recommended for the clean, comfortable, universal, and cost -effective Bit high (248 yuan).Now I only remember that Zhouzhuang had ""double bridges"", Chen Yifei, Wan Sanho, and the bad belly to eat in the farm restaurant in the town.Compared to the dinner of ""Yunting Villa"" is very delicious and good."
1,出租司机一般不知这个酒店，北京汽车大厂前的路牌太细，出租司机看不见走过头，应将路牌加大。房间还算不错，比较宽敞、乾净，提供的卫生用品还可以，但工作桌子上的桌灯没有充足光线，不能阅读，工作不方便。宽带速度还可以。枕头太僵硬而没有弹性，床相对较软并不配合。,"The rental driver generally does not know this hotel. The road sign in front of the Beijing Automobile Factory is too thin. The rental driver cannot see the head and should increase the road sign.The room is pretty good. It is relatively spacious and clean. The sanitary products provided are OK, but the table lamps on the work table do not have sufficient light, cannot be read, and work is not convenient.Broadband speed is okay.The pillow is too stiff and has no elasticity, and the bed is relatively soft and does not cooperate."
1,很新的也很好的，拥有豪华的设备设施，气派非凡，住着舒服，完全的超５星的！！,"Very new and good, have luxurious equipment facilities, extraordinary style, comfortable and comfortable, complete super 5 stars!Intersection"
1,非常喜欢这家酒店。虽然离中心城区有一点距离，不过因为城市不大，这点距离根本不觉得什么。是花园式的酒店，建在山上，环境非常优美，硬件设施配置是4星接近5星的标准了。房间很干净整洁，自助早餐非常超值。该酒店还有别墅房间，适合公司集体出行，不过价格也不菲啊。,"I like this hotel very much.Although there is a little distance from the central urban area, because the city is not large, this distance does not feel much at all.It is a garden -style hotel. It is built on the mountain. The environment is very beautiful. The hardware facility configuration is the standard of 4 stars close to 5 stars.The room is very clean and tidy, and the buffet breakfast is very good value.The hotel also has a villa room, which is suitable for the company's collective travel, but the price is expensive."
1,"物有所值,看来安徽人民币江苏人民是在得多","It is worthwhile, it seems that the people in Jiangsu in Anhui are much more"
1,"酒店建在一个小山丘上,花园式独立小楼,环境很好,酒店和建设,设备,设施都体现","The hotel is built on a small hill, a garden -style independent building, the environment is very good, hotels and construction, equipment, facilities are reflected"
1,房间环境不错，但是外面走廊七弯八拐，让人晕！,"The room environment is good, but the corridor outside the corridor is turning around and turning, making people dizzy!"
1,前两天去上海住在古北湾酒店。对酒店的服务感觉还可以。早餐也不错。房间设施稍微有点陈旧。不过对于短期出差来说还是比较合适的。酒店离虹桥机场很近，在国内转飞机的话有利用价值。离市区就比较远。总的来说根据出差目的和地方，古北湾是值得考虑使用的酒店。,"Two days ago, I went to Shanghai to stay at Gubei Bay Hotel.The service of the hotel feels okay.Breakfast is also good.The room facilities are a little old.However, it is more suitable for short -term business trips.The hotel is very close to Hongqiao Airport, and it is worthy of use in the country.It's far from the city.In general, according to the purpose and place of the business, Gubei Bay is a hotel worth considering."
1,住过好几次，我非常满意，这次价格398很便宜！不过周围什么商店都没有，这点不太方便。早餐是日式的，也很不错。,"I have lived several times, and I am very satisfied. The price this time is very cheap!But there are no shops around, which is not convenient.Breakfast is Japanese -style, and it is also very good."
1,设施环境都很好，唯一美中不足的是去的时候正赶上练习场还在施工改建，没能过把瘾，下次带家里人一起去度假宾馆反馈2008年6月29日：感谢您的点评！练习场已正常开放，并在6、7月份有试打活动，详情可见携程礼包，欢迎您携家人前来。,"The facilities environment is very good. The only disadvantage is that when you go, you are catching up with the practice site and still under construction.IntersectionThe practice site has been opened normally, and there are trial activities in June and July. For details, you can see the Ctrip gift package. You are welcome to bring your family."
1,当地最好的，在全国算性价比不错的五星级酒店,"The best local, five -star hotels with good cost -effectiveness in the country"
1,"住的高级大床房，设施还是令人称赞的，大小也合适。前台的工作人员服务不错的，对我的旅游问题作了细仔的回答。订房前看以前的评论说楼下较吵闹，这次也不觉得吵，问了下原来楼下电信商场搬了。因为五一节的原因特地到酒店附近的红旗商场买了很多成都土特产回去，相当不错。在酒店后面的那条街吃的东西很多，味道也不错。补充点评2008年5月3日：酒店对面还有个小超市,住市中心的这家酒店感觉挺方便的.","The high -end large beds where you live, the facilities are still praised, and the size is also appropriate.The staff at the front desk is good, and I gave a fine answer to my travel questions.Before booking, I saw the previous comments that the downstairs were noisy downstairs, and I didn't feel noisy this time. I asked the original telecommunications mall downstairs and moved.Because of May 1st, I went to Hongqi Shopping Mall near the hotel to buy a lot of governing the Chengdu natives and go back, which is quite good.Eat a lot of things in the street behind the hotel and taste good.Supplementary comment on May 3, 2008: There is also a small supermarket opposite the hotel. The hotel in the city center feels very convenient."
1,"三月下旬入住第一天单人间(360元)优点:高层房间宁静,房间整洁,大堂可上网,商务处的职员小姐很好,解答本人很多旅游问题.改善:在ctrip订,已用信用卡付押金并已写明下午3时入住,但本人在下午3时入住时,职员说没有房,可放下行李,两小时后再返回入住,不知ctrip及此四星酒店怎安排,白白损失两小时的时间.职员只不断说对不起,没有其他补偿(如在其他的星级酒店便会送餐卷或upgrade房间等).总评:下次会尝试其他的酒店.","In the first day of March on the first day of March (360 yuan), the advantage: high -rise rooms are quiet, the room is neat, the lobby can access the Internet, the staff of the business office is very good, answering many travel issues in myself. Improvement: In ctrip, I have paid with credit cards.The deposit has been stated at 3 pm, but when I stayed at 3 pm, the staff said that there was no house, and I could put down my luggage and return to the check -in after two hours. I doTime. The staff is constantly sorry, and there are no other compensation (such as giving meals or upgrade rooms in other star hotels, etc.). Total reviews: Next time, you will try other hotels."
1,交通便利，房间很整洁，价格也合理，服务很不错，工作人员态度也很好，比较满意，唯一不足的就是离4星似乎还差一点！,"The transportation is convenient, the room is very neat, the price is reasonable, the service is very good, the staff attitude is also very good, and they are relatively satisfactory. The only disadvantage is that it seems to be a little bit away from 4 stars!"
1,我订的是标准房，没想到还送了我一份营养早餐，免费的，有水果、有酸奶，搭,"I booked a standard room. I did not expect to give me a nutritional breakfast, free, fruit, yogurt, and"
1,位于过江后钱塘江大桥和钱江四桥之间，不出所料，环境很好，尤其是空气绝对清新，基本没有噪音，好安静！枕潮轩双号房间可以看到钱江，房间新装修过，早餐不错，种类很丰富，就是携程订的只有单早，自己付了100元（四人）。驾车自助游住宿比较合适。,"It is located between the Qiantang River Bridge and Qianjiang Four Bridge after crossing the river. The environment is not expected. The environment is very good, especially the air is absolutely fresh. There is basically no noise.Qianjiang can be seen in the two rooms of the Pillow Chaoxuan. The room has been renovated in the room. The breakfast is good. The variety is very rich. The only one booked by Ctrip is a single early, and he paid 100 yuan (four) himself.It is more suitable for driving buffets to accommodate."
1,离西湖很近，位置很好，很方便。服务很好，订房时没说清楚要大床房，服务台很快解决问题。谢谢。早餐旋转餐厅，环境挺好，就是品种太少。还有玻璃外全是小虫，有点煞风景。下次还会住友好。（房间的卫生间地砖有点脏）,"It is close to West Lake, the location is very good, and it is very convenient.The service is very good. I did not say that the big bed room was clear during reservation, and the service desk quickly solved the problem.Thanks.Breakfast rotates the restaurant, the environment is very good, but there are too few varieties.There are also small bugs outside the glass, which is a bit of the scenery.Will be friendly next time.(The bathroom floor tile in the room is a bit dirty)"
1,"位置好,出门走5分钟是西湖.湖景房是大窗可以看到西湖.酒店服务一般.早餐品种少.宾馆反馈2008年8月11日：非常感谢您能选择入住我们饭店，您所提到的早餐问题，如果方便的话请进一步联系我们，我们将在今后的工作中逐步加以改进和提高。感谢您的点评，衷心期待您的下次光临!","The location is good.

1,"酒店的房间确实不错,只是卫生间小了点.服务员的态度很好.只是在我订房的时候,特地看了一下,酒店离五林广场有多远,携程上写的是0.5公里，是0.5哦。当时感觉特别满意。但到了酒店后，一问，原来蛮远的。根本远远不值0.5公里。失望！宾馆反馈2008年8月7日：非常感谢您能选择入住我们饭店，为您提供优质的服务是我们的宗旨。针对您所提到的问题，我们将及时联系携程更新和调整相关信息。再次感谢您为我们指正相关工作，衷心期待您的下次光临。","The hotel's room is really good, but the bathroom is a bit smaller. The waiter's attitude is very good. Just when I reservations, I took a special look. How far is the hotel from the Wulin Plaza.EssenceI felt particularly satisfactory at the time.But after arriving at the hotel, I asked, it turned out to be quite far away.It is far from 0.5 kilometers.disappointment!Hotel feedback on August 7, 2008: Thank you very much for choosing to stay in our hotel.

1,"每年去杭州数次,本次入住友好是看了网友的评价而去体验一下.友好果不负其名,服务质量上乘,从门童及每位员工的服务都非常的热情和主动.有宾至如归之感.房间整洁床上用品非常的舒适,冲淋房虽小但水和个性化的笼头感觉很惬意.最让我意想不到的是我午睡过的房间以及被我摆放凛乱的浴巾,等我晚上回房打开房门时,房间已整理一新.而且枕上摆放了二朵紫色的兰花感觉很温馨.这些体贴入微的小细节友好做到了.值得一提的是,这里的保洁员工素质都相当不错,我外出时手表和手饰等贵重物品和部分现金都随意的摆放在桌上,都不会丢失.入住友好让我感同深受,有一种象家的感觉.原打算只住一天结果我又延续多住了一天.早餐的旋转餐厅已开始旋转了(网友以前说是不转的)西湖美景尽收眼底,感觉真好.不理想的是餐饮方面,午餐我点了份海南鸡饭68元其味道和买相实在不敢恭维,是我所吃的海南鸡饭最难吃的一家,太不正宗了图有虚名.晚上点了58元一杯的乌龙茶茶质很一般香味不浓,38元一杯的鲜榨弥猴桃汁,弥猴桃质量不好生酸涩具然还掺了很多的水太难吃了,连一般盒装的果汁都不如.建议饭店在餐饮方面能有所改善,争取有更多的回头率.建议大堂和旋转餐厅的钢琴不要成为一种摆设偶尔能听到悠雅的琴声感觉会更好.该饭店地理位置优越,环境设施和服务很满意,性价比较高,以后还会打算入住.宾馆反馈2008年8月7日：非常感谢您能选择入住我们饭店，也非常您中肯的点评。我们饭店在各个岗位积极地推行金钥匙服务理念，力求为每一位宾客营造最舒适惬意的旅居环境，为您提供最热忱的服务是我们的宗旨。就您所提到的用餐时遇到的问题，饭店已经责成相关部门改进，并向您表示歉意。我们饭店大堂和旋转餐厅的钢琴是有定时演奏的，在时间上有固定的安排，希望您下次光临时能欣赏到优美的演奏。再次感谢您的点评，衷心期待您的再次光临。","Go to Hangzhou several times a year. This time I stayed in friendship to see the evaluation of netizens and experience it. The friendship is lived up to its name, the service quality is high, and the services of each employee are very enthusiastic and proactive.The feeling. The clean bedding of the room is very comfortable. Although the punching room is small but the water and personalized cage feels very comfortable. The most unexpected thing is that the room I had nap and the chaotic bath towels were placed.When I went back to the room at night to open the door, the room had been sorted out. And two purple orchids were placed on the pillow. It felt very warm. These considerate small details were friendly.They are all pretty good. When I go out, valuables and some cash such as watches and hand ornaments are placed on the table at will, and I will not be lost. The friendship of staying in the same way makes me feel the same.As a result, I lived another day for another day. The rotating restaurant of breakfast has begun to rotate (netizens used to say that it is not turned).Hainan Chicken Rice is 68 yuan, and it is really dare to compliment. It is the hardest one for Hainan chicken rice I eat. It ’s too unknown to have a virtual name. At night, I ordered 58 yuan a cup of oolong tea.Not thick, 38 yuan a cup of fresh squeezed Mona juice, the quality of Mi Monhon is not good and sour, but a lot of water is mixed with a lot of water.Improved, strive to have more return rates. It is recommended that the piano in the lobby and rotating restaurant should not be a furnishings that occasionally you can hear Youya's piano sound better.The cost is relatively high, and you will plan to stay in in the future. Hotel feedback on August 7, 2008: Thank you very much for choosing to stay in our hotel, and you are very willing to comment.Our restaurant actively promotes the concept of golden key service in various positions, and strives to create the most comfortable and comfortable living environment for each guest.

1,还有提琴曲艺在大厅表演，非常不错，地理位置绝佳，很安静的西安市郊，是住宿的首选,There is also the violin music performed in the lobby. It is very good and the geographical location is excellent.
1,给人印象深刻的一家酒店朋友推荐，带老人去厦门旅游入住该酒店豪华海景房的露台和服务生的微笑给人留下美好的回忆！唯一需要改进的地方是在适当的时候进行新的装修，有的设施陈旧了。,"Recommend a hotel friend who is impressive, take the elderly to Xiamen to travel to the terrace and the smile of the luxury sea view room of the hotel and leave a beautiful memory!The only thing that needs to be improved is to make new decoration at the right time, and some facilities are old."
1,酒店很漂亮，离市中心有点距离，所以很安静。无论从餐厅还是房间客户服务人员，都面带笑容，服务亲切。酒店能很快的记住客人的要求，每天不需要客人重复就会事先准备好。餐厅的饭餐不错，价格也不贵。总之，很愉快。,"The hotel is very beautiful, a little distance from the city center, so it is quiet.Regardless of the restaurant or room customer service staff, they have a smile and kind service.The hotel can quickly remember the customer's request, and it will be prepared in advance without the required guests every day.The meal in the restaurant is good and the price is not expensive.In short, very happy."
1,老牌五星。硬件略显不到位，也有些陈旧，没有室内泳池。但服务很好，酒店当初的设计概念是超前的。最主要的是，风景无敌，面对超大草坪和海景，除了不能下海玩沙、温度不够，有点可以相比海南了。极力推荐面海、带阳台的房间，800不到，面积到位，景色让人满意。,"Old five stars.The hardware is slightly not in place, and there are some old, without indoor pools.But the service is very good, the hotel's original design concept is advanced.The main thing is that the scenery is invincible. In the face of the large lawn and sea view, in addition to being unable to go to the sea to play sand, the temperature is not enough, it can be compared to Hainan.The rooms with the sea and balcony are highly recommended, less than 800, the area is in place, and the scenery is satisfactory."
1,厦门首选无与伦比我已经住了４次，次次流恋忘返。,"Xiamen's first choice of unparalleled I have lived 4 times, and I forgot to return."
1,1、服务人员态度和意识很好；2、早餐品种花样多，口感好；3、下次到太原还住此酒店。,1. The attitude and consciousness of the service staff are very good; 2. There are many varieties of breakfast and good taste; 3. Next time I go to Taiyuan to stay in this hotel.
1,非常方便，周围购物商场较多，离西湖很近，晚上可以去西湖看夜景，回来步行10分钟左右路程，也很安静宾馆反馈2008年7月17日：尊敬的宾客，非常感谢您入住我们饭店。您能在杭州旅游生活愉快，也是我们的快乐！我们希望每一位来杭州的客人都能欣赏到最美丽的风景，享受到最一流的服务，来到杭州就如回家般温暖！,"Very convenient, there are many surrounding shopping malls, very close to West Lake, you can go to West Lake to see the night view at night, and walk back for about 10 minutes. It is also very quiet hotel feedback on July 17, 2008: Dear guest, thank you very much for staying in our hotelEssenceYou can travel happily in Hangzhou, and it is also our happiness!We hope that every guest who comes to Hangzhou can enjoy the most beautiful scenery, enjoy the best service, and come to Hangzhou as warm as home!"
1,6月7号住的标准间，大概是携程上的评价太差了，所以住进去的感觉还满好，哈哈，朝马路，窗帘一拉，没啥2样。拖鞋牙刷牙膏沐浴洗发梳子吹风机热水壶，反正该有的全有，2个单人床也蛮大的。但是隔音效果确实不好，隔壁早上的电话响了，还以为是我们房间的，说话的声音也很清楚。门口有很多小黑车拉生意。走到西湖大概10分钟左右，周围都是大大小小的店，位置也不错。,"The standard room living on June 7 is probably the evaluation of Ctrip is too bad, so the feeling of living in it is good, haha, facing the road, the curtains are pulled, there is nothing 2.Slipper toothbrush toothpaste bath, shampoo hair dryer hot kettle, anyway, there should be all, and the two single beds are quite large.But the sound insulation effect is really not good. The phone next door rang. I thought it was our room, and the voice of speaking was very clear.There are many small black cars in the door.It takes about 10 minutes to walk to the West Lake, with large and small shops around, and the location is good."
1,离西湖很近门童不错比较安静交通便利,It's close to West Lake.
1,地理位置好，主要是韩国人入住，早餐韩式的，房间比较干净，洗手间很小。,"The geographical location is good, mainly Koreans staying, breakfast Korean, the room is relatively clean, and the bathroom is small."
1,酒店设施不错，服务良好。有机会还会入住。,The hotel facilities are good and the service is good.You will be in your chance.
1,"推荐推荐~~!!比亮马河公寓好多了,价格也优惠.","Recommended recommendation ~~ !! It is much better than the Liangma River apartment, and the price is also favorable."
1,"我常在外到出差,是我第一次入住,LOBBY小但感挺精的,度也不,房倒是很好,客大,房全,也可以免外借具,然用的不大,倒是予支持!房不大,但很乾!以我吹毛求疵的要求,整,店非常高的!但是有最大的缺就是地太偏了!到地王,象城要20到30元,而且很塞!叫出租要很久才有!住客要多注意!也希望酒店能跟出租公司配合,降低等!而言房可比五星,但外只能到四星,不是四星的位!可推大家!","I often go abroad to a business trip. It is the first time I stay in. Lobby is small but very refined. The degree is not. The room is very good.Support! The room is not big, but it is very dry! With my faulty request, the whole, the store is very high! But the biggest lack of the earth is too biased! When the king of the earth, the city is 20 to 30 yuan, and it is very stuffy.! It takes a long time for renting! Pay more attention! I also hope that the hotel can cooperate with the rental company and reduce it! The house is comparable to five stars, but it can only reach the four -star, not the four -star place! You can push everyone!"
1,第二次入住，蛮好的酒店。总的来说。在国内算不错的公寓式酒店。,"For the second time, a pretty good hotel.In general.A good apartment hotel in China."
1,"房间的整洁及服务都不错,人员的训练及接待都很亲切,入住的感觉也很不错","The tidely of the room and the service are good, the training and reception of personnel are very kind, and the feeling of staying in is also very good."
1,酒店位置比较适中，离咱们公司客户近，开会开得晚或一大早过去开会都很方便。,The hotel location is relatively moderate. It is close to our company's customers.
1,"酒店设施有些陈旧了,价格有些高,其他还可以","The hotel facilities are old, the price is a bit high, and the others are okay"
1,总体来讲比较不错，当然作为快捷酒店，设施比起假日或者皇冠假日是有相当差距。但是房间给人很舒服的感觉。,"Generally speaking, it is very good. Of course, as a express hotel, there is a considerable gap between the facilities than the holiday or crown holiday.But the room feels very comfortable."
1,综合来讲还是不错的，房间达不到四星，但是很干净，大堂宽敞，值得一提的是，服务非常好，无论行李生还是前台、客房，都给人以热情周到的印象，地段有点偏，但因距离办事地点较近，所以每次去长沙鑫都仍是不二的选择。,"In summary, it is still good. The room does not reach four stars, but it is very clean. The lobby is spacious. It is worth mentioning that the service is very good. Whether the luggage is born or the front desk or the guest room, it gives people an impression of enthusiasm.Better, but because the distance is close, it is still the best choice to go to Changsha Xin every time."
1,"1.下午3点到酒点,3间房,2间还没有打扫好,气愤2.由于是多次入住,以前没有注意:加了双层窗户,与外界的隔音好多了,但隔壁一位老大爷的呼噜声让我直到3点才睡去,早上不到7点,又被他的洗漱声音吵醒了.","1. At 3 pm to the wine point, 3 rooms, 2 rooms have not been cleaned up, angry 2. Because it was check -in many times, I didn’t pay attention before: the double -layer windows were added, and the sound insulation with the outside world was much better, but the next door of the one doorThe snoring of the old man did not sleep until 3 o'clock. At less than 7 o'clock in the morning, he was awakened by his washing sound again."
1,酒店房间比较大（行政楼层），但是没有早餐，也不包上网费，价格偏高，大堂的快餐很难吃。,"The hotel room is relatively large (administrative floor), but there is no breakfast, and the Internet fee is not included. The price is high, and the fast food in the lobby is difficult to eat."
1,携程服务的不错。因为要求安静的房间，携程一上午一直和我沟通最大限度满足我们的要求。酒店以前住过，卫生间太小，虽然订的是商务房，还是小。,"Ctrip service is good.Because of the quiet room, Ctrip has been communicating with me in the morning to meet our requirements to the greatest extent.The hotel has lived before, and the bathroom is too small. Although it is a business house, it is still small."
1,1.8月入住的该度假村，环境确实如网上大家所述，不错，挺满意的。省道上的标牌也够大够明显的。2.入住时可能正遇上该度假村接待一个中行的什么活动吧。说是网上预订的风景房，结果给的房间只能看到浓密的树杈！（莫非这也是一种风景？）3.尽管服务员帮我们换了个树杈不是很浓密的房间，但离我预想的风景房好像还是有所差距的。最后给的解释是：要看风景最后还是到屋外去。晕！4.早餐尚属一般，但服务各方面都是不错的。尤其是停车场，还要求我们按其要求的一致方位停靠车辆，够可以的，赞一个！5.该村最大的优点就是，风景不错，有点世外桃源的感觉，尤其是还有室外游泳池和网球场。（尽管我没机会享用）,"The resort where the resort staying in August is indeed as stated on the Internet. It is good and satisfied.The signs on the provincial highway are also obvious enough.2. When checking in, you may be encountered in the resort to receive a business.It is said that it is an online -reservation landscape room. As a result, the room can only be seen in the dense tree salamander!(Is this a landscape?) 3. Although the waiter helped us change a room that was not very dense, there seemed to be a gap from the landscape room I expected.The last explanation is: It depends on the landscape or goes outside the house.faint!4. Breakfast is still average, but all aspects of service are good.Especially in the parking lot, we also ask us to stop the vehicle in a consistent orientation in accordance with the consistent direction of its requirements. It is enough to like one!5. The biggest advantage of the village is that the scenery is good, and it feels like a paradise, especially the outdoor swimming pool and tennis court.(Although I have no chance to enjoy)"
1,地理位置不错。但好像人气不太旺。不过下次也会考虑住这的。,The geographical location is good.But it seems that the popularity is not very strong.But next time you will consider living here.
1,不错，有免费宽带，很适合出差住的。离开发区很近，很方便。,"Yes, there are free broadband, which is very suitable for business.It is very close to leave the hair area and very convenient."
1,硬软件都相当好，房间环境优雅，服务温馨体贴，早餐也很丰盛。只可惜门口的道路成了单行线，有点不便。但性价比绝对高，下次去沈阳，我仍会坚定不移地选择这家酒店入住！！,"The hard software is quite good, the room environment is elegant, the service is warm and physically, and the breakfast is very rich.Unfortunately, the road at the door became a one -way line, which was a bit inconvenient.But the cost performance is definitely high. Next time I go to Shenyang, I will still unswervingly choose this hotel to stay!Intersection"
1,新华酒店设施齐全，地理位置比较好，在酒店的顶部有一个旋转餐厅，能够在享受美味的同时浏览整个唐山市貌。价格还算公道。,"Xinhua Hotel has complete facilities and has a good geographical location. There is a rotating restaurant at the top of the hotel, which can enjoy the entire Tangshan city appearance while enjoying deliciousness.The price is fair."
1,环境安静，离火车站近。房间布置不错，早餐以中餐为主，丰富。下次接着住,"The environment is quiet and close to the railway station.The room is well -arranged, and the breakfast is mainly Chinese food, which is rich.I will stay next time"
1,环境非常优美，房间大而宽敞。徐州出租车多而便宜，虽然离市中心小有距离，但出入绝对没有问题，即使早上4点半也有。已经是第二次入住了。,"The environment is very beautiful, and the room is large and spacious.There are many and cheap taxis in Xuzhou. Although there is a small distance from the city center, there is absolutely no problem in entering and exit, even at 4:30 in the morning.It's the second time to stay."
1,感觉特别好！四星级的价格，五星级的享受。无论是内部装潢还是服务都特别好。尤其是出门就是湖，景色优美。到市区也方便。特别要提出的是，酒店还为客人准备了洗衣粉，这样袜子之类的小件东西都可以自己解决。还有就是酒店提供了很别致的木梳，用完后忍不住带了一把回来。。。,"It feels particularly good!Four -star price, five -star enjoyment.Both interior decoration and service are particularly good.Especially when going out is the lake, the scenery is beautiful.It is also convenient to go to the city.In particular, the hotel also prepares washing powder for guests, so that small things like socks can be solved by themselves.There is also the hotel provided a very chic wood comb, and I couldn't help bringing it back after use.EssenceEssence"
1,非常喜欢这间宾馆！双人大床非常的舒服。房间配备了饮用纯净水，够得上五星级的标准，服务也非常的好。美中不足的是淋浴房的门好像做得有点问题，一洗澡水就流的满地都是，害我大半夜的擦了好久：（,"I like this hotel very much!Double bed is very comfortable.The room is equipped with pure water for drinking, which is enough for five -star standards, and the service is very good.The lack of beauty is that the door of the shower room seems to be a bit problematic. When the bath water is flowing, it is full of the ground, which has been wiped out in the middle of the night for a long time: ("
1,因平时都是先看点评，后决定订酒店。开元的口碑不错（徐州的同学也赞赏有加），所以就定了。房间的问题有：1，蚂蚁的问题我也碰到了，但我想：一来，此酒店依山傍水，我们白天出去时，很多时候是把阳台门开着透气(不仅仅住一天)。那么，可能，蚂蚁是这样被我们“请”进来的――当然，请进来容易，请出去难哪！二来，在其他宾馆也遇到过（连在埃及的五星级酒店也见过此小东西），好在它的活动场所仅在卫生间，见怪不怪了！2，淋浴房做得不太好，洗澡时水会漏出来。不该啊！不该！唯一的瑕疵！值得一提的是该店的服务质量真的很好!在我住过的无数国内酒店中，仅次于桂林漓江大酒店！我定了面湖房，但到时，总台的服务生查下来告知面湖房的角度不好，问我要不要重新考虑。尽管后来，重选了面山房。但人性化的服务让人很舒服！这次旅程还有让我觉得美中不足的是：携程的价格并没有让我觉得很实惠，因为在徐州的朋友可以拿到更低价（598--518），当时都可以退订，但想想诚信原则，就算了。但心里还是有点不舒服啦！,"Because you usually look at the comments first, then decide to book a hotel.Kaiyuan's reputation is good (Xuzhou classmates also appreciate and add), so it is determined.The problem in the room is: 1. I also encountered the problem of ants, but I think: Once, this hotel is surrounded by mountains and rivers. When we go out during the day, we often take the balcony door with ventilation (not only staying for one day).So, maybe, the ants were ""invited"" in this way -of course, it is easy to come in, please go out!Secondly, I also encountered in other hotels (I have seen this little thing in even five -star hotels in Egypt). Fortunately, its activity venue is only in the bathroom, it is no wonder!2. The shower room is not very good, and the water will leak out during the bath.Don't!Shouldn't!The only flaw!It is worth mentioning that the quality of the store is really good! Among the countless domestic hotels I have lived, it is second only to the Lijiang Hotel in Guilin!I set a noodle lake house, but then, the waiter of the main station checked the angle of the Noodle Lake house was not good, and asked if I would like to consider it again.Despite the re -election of the Montenemia.But humanized services are very comfortable!What makes me feel that this journey is in disadvantages this time: Ctrip's price does not make me feel affordable, because friends in Xuzhou can get a lower price (598--518). At that timeThe principle of integrity, even if.But my heart is still a bit uncomfortable!"
1,其他倒没什么，就是太吵了，隔音不好，希望能改进一下。,"There is nothing else, but it is too noisy, the sound insulation is not good, I hope to improve it."
1,"这家酒店不错,大堂很气派,服务很热情,下次还住这里","This hotel is good, the lobby is very elegant, and the service is very enthusiastic. I will live here next time"
1,"住的商务间很大,这样使得看电视很费力,不得已把一个沙发拖过来,床太硬.其他都还好.","The business of living is very large, so that watching TV is very laborious, and I have to drag a sofa over, the bed is too hard. The others are okay."
1,"外环境不错,酒店有好几栋楼，挺赏心悦目的，大厅挺安静，布置也很有点小资情调，可能是黄金周刚结束的缘故吧。我住的是主楼２４０元的房间，四星级这个价格在国内应该很值了。早餐是自助的，以中式为主，品种挺多，挺适合咱中国人的胃。结账时才知道还有更经济的附楼（好像叫展鸿楼）的房间只要一百多元，不过未挂星。（大门还在改造）下次去试试。值的推荐呀……补充点评2007年10月10日：对了，还有免费水果，很温馨的感觉，宽带速度也很快。","The outside environment is good. There are several buildings in the hotel. It is very pleasing to the eye. The hall is quite quiet and the layout is a bit petty -funded. It may be due to the end of the Golden Zhougang.I live in a room with a main building of 240 yuan. The price of four -star is worth it in China.Breakfast is self -service, mainly Chinese, with a lot of varieties, which is quite suitable for our Chinese stomach.At the time of checkout, I learned that there were only more than 100 yuan in rooms with more economical attached buildings (like Zhan Honglou), but they did not hang.(The gate is still being transformed) Try it next time.Recommended value ... Supplementary comment on October 10, 2007: By the way, there are free fruits, a very warm feeling, and the broadband speed is fast."
1,"酒后设施还可以房间很大唯一就是窗外景色一般,去机场大概是人少的原因酒店安排了小车送而且司机开的很好,总体感觉还行.","After drinking the facilities, the only one in the room is that the scenery outside the window is normal. It is probably that the number of people in the airport is probably that the hotel arranges a car and the driver is driving well. The overall feeling is okay."
1,"交通比较方便,房间和服务都还好,入住时太累了,睡得很香","The transportation is more convenient, the room and the service are okay."
1,位置靠近区体校，不是正市区中心，但交通都算方便，离火车站也近。各方面都为标准4星酒店，服务比较热情，可能和管理有关。以前都是住凤凰，甬江的，这次在机场看到有酒店人员打着免费接机的牌子就注意上了，回程就住到该酒店，去机场只要和前台预约一下就可以了，一个人都送机。对于往返机场的旅客还是很方便的。,"The location is close to the district sports school, not in the center of the urban area, but the transportation is convenient, and it is close to the train station.All aspects are standard 4 -star hotels. The service is more enthusiastic and may be related to management.In the past, I lived in Phoenix and Yongjiang. This time, I saw a hotel staff at the airport with a free pick -up sign. I stayed at the hotel when I returned. I only want to make an appointment with the front desk.Delivery.It is still very convenient for passengers to and from the airport."
1,这次去广西在金都住了2天，一次普通房，一次豪华房。规规矩矩4星级。服务很好，房间不错，离火车站步行10分钟。性价比很好。当然广西整体房价不高。推荐。,"This time I lived in Golden Capital in Guangxi for 2 days, once a normal room, a luxurious room.4 stars.The service is very good, the room is good, walk 10 minutes from the train station.The price / performance ratio is very good.Of course, the overall house price of Guangxi is not high.recommend."
1,第二次入住。嗯，老实说，中规中矩吧，没有特别好，也没发现什么不好。补充点评2008年3月5日：对，电梯要查房卡才能使用，稍有点麻烦，不过酒店管理，可以理解,"Check in the second time.Well, honestly, it is quite good, not particularly good, and not found any bad.Supplementary comment on March 5, 2008: Yes, the elevator needs to be used for a housing card, which is a bit troublesome, but the hotel management can be understood"
1,位置不错，逛街购物相当方便。房间不算太大，不过，开始住入一个房间没有做无烟处理，有气味。另一个房间，卫生间灯坏了，会闪烁。当然，都处理好了，服务很快，不过能事先发现和处理是不是更好呢？,"The location is good, shopping is quite convenient.The room is not too big, but it starts to live in a room without smoke -free treatment and smells.In another room, the bathroom lights are broken and will flash.Of course, it is well handled and the service is fast, but can it be better to find and deal with it in advance?"
1,酒店还不错，就是提供的半日游和一日游太黑了！,"The hotel is pretty good, that is, the half -day tour and one -day trip are too dark!"
1,"早餐不行,房间太小.前台结帐态度还不错,","Breakfast is not good, the room is too small. The attitude of the front desk will be pretty good,"
1,很同意交通方便的说，近几个月一直选这里。但是，携程的价格比直接找酒店定还贵。这令人很不满意。希望携程能重视对客户价格方面的承诺。,"I agree with the convenience of transportation, and I have been choosing here in recent months.However, Ctrip's price is more expensive than finding the hotel directly.This is very unsatisfactory.It is hoped that Ctrip can attach importance to commitment to customer prices."
1,性价比还是比较高的，比同是四星的杭州武林广场那边的一些四星好一些。去杭州出差常常住的酒店,"The cost -effectiveness is relatively high, and it is better than some four stars in Hangzhou Wulin Square, which is also a four -star.Go to the hotel where you stay in Hangzhou for a long time"
1,虽然离西湖不太近，但是交通也算方便，房间也不错。只是感觉床和枕头偏软，床较短。酒店的隔音不是很好，走廊里的声音及隔壁的电视声音稍大些就听得很清楚。,"Although not too close to West Lake, the transportation is convenient and the room is good.It just feels that the bed and the pillow are soft and the bed is short.The sound insulation of the hotel is not very good. The sound in the corridor and the TV sound next door are a little louder."
1,总体来说还是不错的。说是酒店，其实更像是个公寓，一方面楼里有好几层是办公用的，另一方面房间的配备也像。我们订的是豪华大床房，先说优点：入住和退房都挺快的，商务中心可以订车票，房间不小挺干净的，有卫星电视。缺点也有几个：一是离西湖有点远(20-30分钟行走)，二是周围吃饭的地方太少，只有三家，早餐得走15分钟到延安路才有(不过好吃又不贵，人很多)，三是浴室有点小，没有单独的沐浴房。宾馆反馈2007年11月5日：首先感谢您对我酒店提出宝贵的评价，在这里我们对您提出的一些问题将做一些相应的解释：1、酒店离西湖的总路程为一站路的公交车程。2、从我酒店出门（庆春路）往东方向步行大约2分钟，就有许多饭店包括早餐店，价格实惠且品种丰富，这条街是杭州餐饮比较集中的一条街，建议您下次入住时可直接咨询前台，我们将热忱为您服务。,"Overall, it is quite good.It is more like a hotel, which is actually more like an apartment. On the one hand, there are several floors in the building, and on the other hand, the equipment in the room is also similar.We ordered a luxurious large bed room. First, the advantages are: check -in and check -up are quite fast. The business center can book tickets. The room is not small and there are satellite TVs.There are also a few disadvantages: one is a bit far from the West Lake (walking 20-30 minutes), and the other is that there are too few places to eat around, only three, and you have to walk for 15 minutes to Yan'an Road.Many), the third is that the bathroom is a bit small and there is no separate bath room.Hotel feedback on November 5, 2007: First of all, thank you for your valuable evaluation of our hotel. Here we will make some corresponding explanations on some of the problems you raised: 1.Drive.2. Go out from my hotel (Qingchun Road) to walk east to the east for about 2 minutes. There are many restaurants including breakfast restaurants. The price is affordable and rich in variety. This street is a more concentrated street in Hangzhou.You can directly consult the front desk, we will be enthusiastic about serving you."
1,服务一般，环境还可以，位置相对偏僻一些，商务中心的刀子奇快无比。,"The service is average, the environment is okay, the location is relatively remote, and the knife of the business center is extremely strange."
1,这家酒店离天津西青区比较近，条件和服务也没有想象中的那么差，还是值得推荐的。,"This hotel is relatively close to Tianjin Xiqing District, and the conditions and services are not as bad as expected, and it is still recommended."
1,本次入住的是商务双床房，基本满意。房间空间比较大，环境和布局都比较好，在整体的空间内体现出卧室和客厅的格局，客厅完全可以接待三两个朋友。电脑是dell的电脑，性能基本主流，网速也令人满意。不足之处：卫生间空间比较小，但整体是满意的。酒店门口停车比较麻烦，行李必须从路边拿下来走到大堂，而门童的服务意识也不是很强。餐厅关闭时间太早，晚上9点钟就不提供服务了，要知道在酒店附近想找吃饭的地方可不是很容易的。,"This time I stayed in the business double bed, which was basically satisfied.The room space is relatively large, and the environment and layout are relatively good. In the overall space, the structure of the bedroom and living room is reflected. The living room can receive three or two friends.The computer is a Dell's computer. The performance is basically mainstream and the network speed is also satisfactory.Insurance: The bathroom space is relatively small, but the overall is satisfactory.Parking at the entrance of the hotel is more troublesome. The luggage must be taken down from the roadside to the lobby, and Men Tong's service awareness is not very strong.The restaurant is closed too early, and it will not provide services at 9 o'clock in the evening. It is not easy to know that where you want to find meals near the hotel."
1,客房整洁，服务周到，卫浴稍小，餐饮略贵，整体不错！,"The room is clean, the service is thoughtful, the bathroom is slightly smaller, the catering is slightly expensive, and the overall is good!"
1,我订的是1310大床间，房间里面大小合适，卫生也很好，总的来说超级满意，空调非常好，一点都不冷。床单上还给了一枝玫瑰，桌上给了一盘水果，还有2瓶免费的矿泉水。附属品比如小吃饮料也很齐全。唯一觉得有点欠缺的地方是卫生间比较小。还有一个问题就是我入住的价格是218￥，但是宾馆对对面的某个公司的公开价格是折后198￥。这个问题比较让人寒心。因为住的是同样的房间，我付218，人家付198，太不舒服了。。。如果房价在200以内，这里的性价比，还是非常值得推荐的！,"I booked a large bed in the 1310 bed. The size of the room is suitable, and the hygiene is also very good. Generally speaking, the air conditioner is very good and it is not cold at all.A rose was also given on the sheets, a plate of fruits on the table, and 2 bottles of free mineral water.Auxiliary products such as snacks and drinks are also complete.The only thing that feels a bit lacking is that the bathroom is relatively small.Another problem is that the price I stayed at was 218 ￥, but the public price of a hotel opposite the company was 198 ￥.This problem is more chilling.Because I lived in the same room, I paid 218, and people paid 198, which was too uncomfortable.EssenceEssenceIf house prices are within 200, the cost -effectiveness here is still very recommended!"
1,设施有点陈旧，住的大床间感觉房屋面积过小，性价比不如宜宾银龙戎州大厦宾馆,"The facilities are a bit old, and the large beds living in the large bed feel that the house area is too small."
1,"宜宾人都说华荣是最好的.....其他没去过,不知道真假.地方太偏僻了,在开发区,旁边小店饭馆都不见几个.好象住华荣的人很少的.","Yibin said that Hua Rong is the best ... I have never been there, I do n’t know that the authenticity is. The place is too remote. In the development zone, there are no few shops next to the restaurants. It seems that people who live in HuarongFew."
1,不错的酒店，服务态度很好，环境好，满意。前台小姐漂亮，不错。建议选房间的时候尽量选靠里面的房间，免得早上有点儿闹（临街）。停车场要收费10元，非常不好！,"A good hotel, the service attitude is very good, the environment is good and satisfied.The front desk lady is beautiful and good.It is recommended to choose the room inside when choosing a room, so as not to be a little troubled in the morning.The parking lot is 10 yuan, which is very bad!"
1,"听同行介绍，又想在办完事后看看东湖，所以就订了这家，实际上是武汉电信的会议中心，由锦江集团管理的。应该说房间里的东西不错，有电脑和大屏幕的液晶电视，对于喜欢上网的朋友来说是个惊喜。不过宾馆客人并不多，显得有点冷清，我认为主要跟它的价格有关，456元的价格居然不含早餐，加上早餐509元，这个价格对于不处于闹市区的酒店来说，显得贵了，不具有竞争力。另外服务也没有有些朋友说的那么好，我订的时候携程提醒我说酒店赠送2瓶软饮料，可是一直到我入住房间，酒店方面没有任何的告知，后来我到前台去询问，才告诉我只能喝雪碧和可乐，其他的饮料都得收钱，有点被愚弄的感觉。另外酒店没有娱乐设施（ＫＴＶ、保健等），对于喜欢热闹的朋友来说，可能有些缺憾。总体而言，如果还是这个价格，估计下次入住的可能性不大。还有，从携程订的房间一般都是酒店朝向和楼层最差的房间（我遇到过许多次），这点携程需要以客户为本，与酒店方面多多协调，否则仅仅是靠一点不值钱的积分来忽悠顾客，最终会被客户抛弃。补充点评2008年7月21日：补充一下，酒店房间的卫生间实在小，这样小的卫生间好像是２０年设计的一样。我１.６５的个子，洗澡的时候转身都有点困难，左右前后都得撞上淋浴房的玻璃，如果个子大点，真不知道怎么洗澡。还有，预定的时候，携程说酒店有到机场的穿梭巴士，可住下后问酒店，说是早就没有了，有点失望。宾馆反馈2008年7月31日：谢谢您给酒店提出的几点意见,我们已经针对这几个问题进行了改正。赠送的软饮已经注明是雪碧或可乐；机场大巴由于更改了线路所以暂时取消了，酒店已经在网站上更改。","Listening to the introduction of the colleagues, I wanted to see Donghu after the incident, so I booked this one. In fact, it was the conference center of Wuhan Telecom, which was managed by Jinjiang Group.It should be said that the rooms in the room are good. There are LCD TVs with computers and large screens, which is a surprise for friends who like the Internet.However, there are not many guests in the hotel, and it seems a bit deserted. I think it is mainly related to its price. The price of 456 yuan does not include breakfast. In addition to 509 yuan for breakfast, this price is expensive for hotels that are not in the downtown area.It is not competitive.In addition, there are no friends who said that the service is as good as. When I booked, Ctrip reminded me to give me 2 bottles of soft drinks, but until I got into the room, there was no notification in the hotel. Later, I went to the front desk to ask.Being able to drink Sprite and Coke, other drinks have to be collected, a little foolish.In addition, the hotel does not have entertainment facilities (KTV, health care, etc.), and it may be a little regrettable for friends who like lively.Overall, if this price is still, it is estimated that the possibility of staying next time is not much.In addition, the rooms ordered from Ctrip are generally the hotel's worst room and the worst floor of the floor (I have encountered many times). This point of Ctrip needs to be customer -oriented and coordinate with the hotel.Customers who come to flicker are eventually abandoned by customers.Supplementary comment on July 21, 2008: In addition, the bathroom in the hotel room is really small. Such a small bathroom seems to be designed in 20 years.My 1.65 person, it is a bit difficult to turn around when I take a bath. I have to hit the glass of the shower room left and right. If I get older, I really do n’t know how to take a bath.In addition, when I was booked, Ctrip said that the hotel had a shuttle bus at the airport, but after staying, I asked the hotel and said that it was gone long ago, and it was a bit disappointed.Hotel feedback on July 31, 2008: Thank you for your opinions on the hotel's opinions. We have made corrections on these issues.The gift of soft drinks has been indicated as Sprite or Cola; the airport bus is temporarily canceled because it has changed the line, and the hotel has changed on the website."
1,我于4月底入住该酒店，整体来说该酒店超出我的预期。酒店门口有公交车站，多路公交车经过；还有出租车在门口，打车也很方便。酒店客房层设有中庭，宽敞明亮，让人感觉眼前一亮。标房面积很大，还配有电脑提供免费上网。服务员非常热情，能主动问候并提供建议。某种程度上感觉是五星级酒店，下次还会来。,"I stayed at the hotel at the end of April, overall, the hotel exceeded my expectations.There is a bus station at the entrance of the hotel, and the multi -way bus passes through; the taxi is at the door, and it is also convenient to take a taxi.The hotel room has an atrium, which is spacious and bright, making people feel bright.The benchmarking area is very large, and it is equipped with a computer to provide free Internet access.The waiter is very enthusiastic and can take the initiative to greet and provide suggestions.To some extent, it feels like a five -star hotel and will come next time."
1,"房间不错很干净,交通便利,旁边有大型超市,没有特别服务,价格偏高","The rooms are good and clean, and the transportation is convenient. There are large supermarkets next to it. There are no special services. The price is high."
1,"去年去武汉住的是帅府,真是痛心啊,以致于影响到对武汉的印象.不过这次住锦江,真是爽啊.酒店环境超级好,交通非常方便,就在洪山广场东北角上,如果没有记错方向的话.酒店服务非常好,当天因为下雨,衣服全部湿了,由于计划出差一天,所以没有被用的衣服,酒店人员帮我免费烘干,态度特别好,帮我解决了大问题.另外,酒店房间较少,所以安静的很.价格也有竞争力,不是非常高,性价比绝对超值.这个酒店,是我从携程上预定过的最舒服的酒店之一.谢谢.","Last year, I went to Wuhan to live in Shuai Mansion. It was really distressed, so that it affected the impression of Wuhan. However, this time it was cool to live in Jinjiang. The hotel environment is super good and the traffic is very convenient.If you remember the wrong direction, the hotel service is very good. Because of the rain that day, all the clothes were wet. Because the plan was a day of business trip, the hotel staff helped me dry it for free.Question. In addition, there are fewer hotel rooms, so it is very quiet. The price is also competitive. It is not very high. The cost performance is absolutely value. This hotel is one of the most comfortable hotels I have booked from Ctrip. Thank you."
1,这家酒店外表并不怎么起眼，但内部不错，服务业比较到位，对于讲究实惠的客人是很好的选择（除非很要表面好看的人）。值得下次再去住！,"This hotel's appearance is not very eye -catching, but the internal is good and the service industry is in place. It is a good choice for customers who pay attention to affordable (unless they are very good -looking).It's worth living again next time!"
1,早餐还可以，停车方便，二楼餐厅很安静。朝南的房间靠近锅炉房，声音吵。宾馆反馈2008年8月12日：回复：尊敬的宾客：首先非常感谢您对本酒店的肯定。关于您反映的房间外噪音问题，是酒店一项临时性的施工引起，我们对施工的噪音已有具体的要求和措施，也将更加严格执行。诚挚欢迎您的再次光临！,"Breakfast is okay, it is convenient to park, and the restaurant on the second floor is quiet.The room facing the south is close to the boiler room, and the sound is noisy.Hotel feedback on August 12, 2008: Reply: Dear guest: First of all, thank you very much for your affirmation of the hotel.Regarding the noise of the room you reflect, it is caused by a temporary construction of the hotel. We have specific requirements and measures for the noise of construction, and will also be more strict.Sincerely welcome you to come again!"
1,"环境优美,很特别的地方,各项都还不错,而且提前了一天去接站,原来司机听错了时间,唯一感到很不安的是酒店只管起飞不管降落,走的时候就没人管了.早晨5:30去火车站,竟然找不到车,去了就知道,必须提前安排好车,还好,那边的出租车司机蛮讲信誉的,出租车很少,早晨提前打了电话能够及时到,我这是去火车站,别的地方可能就难保了.这个地方总体来说,可以,还是老问题,空调不太好,光是响声不制热,后来就把它关掉了.","The environment is beautiful, very special, all the items are not bad, and after a day in advance to pick up the station. It turned out that the driver heard the wrong time. The only thing that felt very uneasy was that the hotel took off, regardless of the landing.5:30 Go to the train station, but you can't find a car. If you go, you know that you must arrange the car in advance. Fortunately, the taxi driver over there is very reputation. There are very few taxis.When I go to the train station, it may be difficult to keep it elsewhere. In general, this place is okay, it is still old problem, the air conditioner is not very good, the sound is not heated, and then it turned off it."
1,房间不错，还有个阳台，能看到大院的景色，不过阳台之间的间隔太近了，使人外出的时候觉得不太安全，但环境是一流的。本来网上是说有机场接送的，不过没有明确的指引怎么订，到步之后都只能自己打车去酒店。,"The room is good. There is also a balcony. You can see the scenery of the courtyard, but the interval between the balcony is too close, making people feel not safe when they go out, but the environment is first -class.Originally, there was an airport pick -up, but there was no clear guidance how to order. After the reaching, I could only take a taxi to the hotel by themselves."
1,如果下次到武夷山，我还是会选择这家酒店，很好！！！,"If you arrive at Wuyi Mountain next time, I will still choose this hotel, very good!IntersectionIntersection"
1,酒店很干净，窗外见山，山味很好闻。早餐不错，凉拌米粉特别好吃，小菜也好。餐厅价格比外面高，但卫生好很多，质量也较高，有一个靓妹很养眼。酒店位置好，闹中取静。总的来说，非常满意，特别是价格很便宜，180含双早，^_^。会推荐朋友来。补充点评2008年8月16日：可以刷卡的。,"The hotel is very clean, the mountains are seen outside the window, and the mountain taste is very good.Breakfast is good, cold rice noodles are particularly delicious, and small dishes.The price of the restaurant is higher than the outside, but the hygiene is much better and the quality is high. There is a beautiful girl very eye -catching.The hotel location is good, and you are quiet.Overall, very satisfied, especially the price is very cheap, 180 with double early early,^_^.I will recommend friends.Supplementary comment on August 16, 2008: You can swipe your card."
1,算是海口市比较好的酒店了。处于市中心，购物方便。服务态度好。保险柜出问题了叫人来开，打个电话很快几个人就来搞定了。结果他们走了之后，设定密码还是弄不好，再次叫他们过来指导，也是很快就来了，没有厌烦，很好的笑脸。,"It is a better hotel in Haikou.It is in the city center and is convenient for shopping.Good service attitude.When there was a problem with the safe, people came to drive, and a few people came to get it soon.As a result, after they left, they couldn't get the password. They asked them to come over again, and they soon came. They were not bored, and they smiled well."
1,"酒店有三种色调的房间,白色,米色和翠绿色,好象还有女士楼层看电梯里的介绍图片是粉红色的,挺有意思.宽带上网也比较快,交通方便,值得推荐.","The hotel has three hue rooms, white, beige, and emerald green. It seems that there are also pink introductors in the lady floor to watch the elevator, which is very interesting. Broadband Internet access is relatively fast, convenient for transportation, and it is worth recommending."
1,有道机场的专车接送，就是价格太高。其他的还可以,The special car delivery of Youdao Airport is that the price is too high.Others can
1,"除了离机场近,我实在想不到什么其他理由非得选择他.","Except that it is close to the airport, I really can't think of any other reasons to choose him."
1,对于我来说这家酒店就真是方便回家。因为不是本地人所以经常要赶飞机而这酒店就里机场5分钟实在是太方便了。,"For me, this hotel is really convenient to go home.Because it is not a local person, it is too convenient to catch the airport for 5 minutes."
1,看了网友的点评后选择入住该酒店，在各方面的总体印象都不错。酒店离西湖步行约十分钟，离夜市步行约二、三分钟，离九百碗面馆、奎元馆、知味观步行约六、七分钟，都十分方便。每天有免费水果赠送。早餐的菜式就其价格来说也还算可以。房间内的拖鞋时间穿得稍长会起毛，很不舒服，建议改进。不爽的事发生在酒店内餐厅。就餐前曾致电酒店总台，并且还亲自到餐厅确认，住店客人在酒店内餐厅就餐可以打九折，可是一次在酒店的韩国村吃晚饭，一次在酒店的中餐厅吃午饭，都不给打折。韩国村的答复是他们不属于酒店，只是租借酒店的地方，所以不能打折。中餐厅的答复是除非有酒店VIP卡，否则不能打折。让人搞不懂的是既然这样，酒店总台为什么说可以打折呢？非常令人失望。,"After watching the comments of netizens, I chose to stay in the hotel, and the overall impression of all aspects was good.The hotel walks about ten minutes from West Lake, about two or three minutes away from the night market, and it is very convenient to walk for about six or seven minutes from the 900 bowls of noodles, Kuiyuan Pavilion, and Zhiwei Guan.There are free fruit gifts every day.Breakfast dishes are okay for its price.The slippers in the room can be used for a long time, and it is very uncomfortable. It is recommended to improve it.Unhappy things happened in the hotel restaurant.Before the meal, I called the hotel's head station, and I also went to the restaurant to confirm that the guests in the hotel can get a 10 % discount in the restaurant in the hotel.Discount.The response from Korean villages is that they do not belong to the hotel, but they just rent a hotel, so they cannot be discounted.The response from the Chinese restaurant is unless there is a hotel VIP card, it cannot be discounted.What makes people don't understand is that since this is the case, why can the hotel's main station say that it can be discounted?Very disappointing."
1,酒店服务特别棒，虽只是准四星，但性价比友好、马可波罗酒店高。总之是因好的服务让我再次选择这家酒店入住，以后还会继续选择这家酒店。宾馆反馈2008年8月11日：非常感谢您对中山国际的肯定和支持，顾客至上是我们服务的宗旨。衷心期盼您的下次光临，为我们提出更多宝贵的意见和建议。,"The hotel service is particularly great. Although it is only a quasi -four -star, it is cost -effective and high in Marco Polo Hotel.In short, because of good services, I chose this hotel to stay again, and I will continue to choose this hotel in the future.Hotel feedback on August 11, 2008: Thank you very much for your affirmation and support for Zhongshan International. Customers first are the purpose of our service.I sincerely look forward to your next visit and make more valuable opinions and suggestions for us."
1,服务很周到，态度也很好，并且为我们升级到行政楼层。房间很干净，设施也很齐全，大床很大，睡得很爽，晚上还送了绿豆汤，很好喝，市内电话是免费的，很方便我们打114查询杭州美食。早餐品种很多，口味也很好，服务也很周到，会有服务员主动询问咖啡or红茶。以后如果有机会再去杭州，一定还住中山。Bytheway，门口的taxi最好能合理选配一下，竟然带我们绕路，多花了15元打的费不说，还害的我们没赶上车，浪费了车票。。宾馆反馈2008年8月12日：非常感谢您选择中山国际作为您的休栖之地，也非常感谢您对我们提出的意见和建议。酒店也将会向有关部门反映出租车的问题，希望能为客人提供更为有效的服务。忠心期盼您的再次光临。,"The service is very thoughtful and the attitude is also very good, and it is upgraded to the administrative floor for us.The room is very clean, the facilities are very complete, the big bed is very large, and the sleep is very good. It also gave the mung bean soup at night. It was delicious. The phone in the city was free.There are many breakfast varieties, good tastes, and very thoughtful services. Some waiters will take the initiative to ask coffee or black tea.If you have the opportunity to go to Hangzhou in the future, you must still live in Zhongshan.Bytheway, the taxi at the door is best to choose a reasonable match. It took us to take a detour. It cost 15 yuan to do not say that we did not catch up with the car and waste the ticket.EssenceHotel feedback on August 12, 2008: Thank you very much for choosing Zhongshan International as your rescue land, and thank you very much for your opinions and suggestions on us.The hotel will also reflect the problem of renting the car to the relevant departments, hoping to provide guests with more effective services.Faithful look forward to your visit again."
1,酒店设施很新，细节问题处理非常好！服务人员的态度非常好，很喜欢，已经多次入住，以后还会作为杭州出差的首选酒店！宾馆反馈2008年8月11日：非常感谢您对酒店的肯定和支持，您对我们的肯定是我们前进的最大动力，我们一定会再接再励努力为客人提供高品质的服务。忠心期盼您的再次光临。,"The hotel facilities are very new, and the details of the details are very good!The attitude of the service staff is very good, I like it very much, I have been staying many times, and I will be the first choice hotel in Hangzhou on a business trip!Hotel feedback on August 11, 2008: Thank you very much for your affirmation and support for the hotel. You are definitely our biggest motivation for us. We will continue to work hard to provide customers with high -quality services.Faithful look forward to your visit again."
1,"感觉不错,下次一定再住.只是卫生间的龙头,不知道是设计师选的还是业主选的.非常的使用不变.而且也很不环保.龙头没有起泡器.水花四溅.弄的一生.而且涂了肥皂不好开龙头.必须一遍涂手,一遍开着龙头.非常浪费.总之就是不实际宾馆反馈2008年8月12日：非常感谢您选择中山国际作为您的休栖之地，同时也非常感谢您对中山国际提出的宝贵意见。酒店倡导绿色消费，对环保酒店非常重视。我们将会对房间内的水龙头作全面检查，将对上述问题作出相应的整改。忠心期盼您的下次入住。","It feels good, I must live again next time. It's just the leader in the bathroom. I don't know if it is the designer or the owner. It is very unchanged. And it is not environmentally friendly.Life. And the soap is not easy to open the faucet. You must apply your hands again and again, and the faucet is opened again. Very wasteful. In short, it is unrealistic hotel feedback on August 12, 2008At the same time, thank you very much for your valuable opinions on Zhongshan International.The hotel advocates green consumption and attaches great importance to environmental hotels.We will conduct a comprehensive inspection of the faucet in the room and will make a corresponding rectification of the above issues.Faithful look forward to your next check -in."
1,"地理位置非常好,交通方便,距西湖很近,另外步行逛街也很方便,入住手续办理很慢，退房时比较快，前台应该主动提供发票（提出开票要求才给开的）,房间设施比较好，此次入住的房间非常安静,水果也新鲜，房间内整体比较干净，客房服务也很好，比较满意，下次还会选择入住！宾馆反馈2008年8月7日：非常感谢您选择中山国际，您对酒店的肯定是我们前进的最大动力。我们会加强对前台人员的培训。忠心期待您的下次光临。","The geographical location is very good, the transportation is convenient, and it is very close to West Lake. In addition, walking shopping is also very convenient. The check -in procedures are very slow. The check -in is relatively fast.

You are definitely our biggest motivation for the hotel.We will strengthen the training of front desk personnel.Looking forward to your next visit."
1,预订海景花园大酒店已经没有房间了，于是换到了这里，看到外表有些疑惑，因为酒店并不大，入住时却得到了出乎意料的惊喜：前台服务很温馨，cheakin的速度很快，门童很热情，主动给你提行李，如果开车去会记住为你留好车位；房间面积不小，装饰得很精致，还有果盘赠送；环境稍差些，看不到海景，但是从酒店出来，穿过马路一直向海走，再过一条马路就到了著名的韩式烧烤---李朝木炭烧烤了，另外一点不足就是旁边有一家KTV，晚上能感觉到有些吵。总体感觉很不错，可以给4星。,"There is no room for booking the sea -view garden hotel, so I changed it here and saw that there were some doubts about the appearance, because the hotel was not large, but I got unexpected surprises when I stayed: the front desk service was very warm, Cheakin was fast, the door was fast, the door was the door, and the door was the door.Tong is very enthusiastic and take the initiative to raise your luggage. If you drive, you will remember to keep your parking space for you;Come out, walk through the road and walk towards the sea, and then go to a road to the famous Korean barbecue-Li Chao charcoal barbecue. Another shortcoming is that there is a KTV next to it. You can feel a little noisy at night.Overall feels very good, you can give 4 stars."
1,在昆山属于比较好的酒店了，如果价格低于500元，性价比就更高了。总体还行。,"It is a better hotel in Kunshan. If the price is less than 500 yuan, the cost performance will be higher.Overall."
1,前台入住手续办理顺利，非常感谢，虽然客人不会中文，英文尚欠，早饭丰富。,"The front desk is going well. Thank you very much. Although the guests do not know Chinese, the English is still owed, and the breakfast is rich."
1,已经住过两次了，我发现酒店附近很难打到出租车，而且酒店自备的出租车不够使用，如果打预约电话叫出租车的的话，时间很难保证，上次入住之后，就由于这个原因，我错过了一趟由上海-北京的航班，我觉得作为这样档次的酒店，这些方面的服务是应该考虑进去的。如果还有别的选择的话，我下次或许不会再住中信。另外，对于中信这样的酒店，协议价500元还是有点贵了。,"I have lived twice, and I found that it is difficult to get a taxi near the hotel, and the taxi bossed by the hotel is not enough. If you call the taxi call, it is difficult to guarantee. After the last stay, it will be due to the last time you stay.For this reason, I missed a flight from Shanghai-Beijing. I think that as such a hotel, these services should be considered in these aspects.If there are other choices, I may not live in CITIC next time.In addition, for hotels like CITIC, the agreement price is 500 yuan."
1,绵州酒店算是绵阳市区最好的酒店之一，但是毕竟是四星级的，品质不可能太好。优点：1、服务态度好，接受信用卡付帐。2、位置优越，在市中心，靠近购物中心、火车站、市政府。3、出租车充裕，停车场面积大。4、3楼的中餐厅不错。味道好，价格优惠，值得去吃吃。5、房间面积特别大，住起来特别舒服。卫生间也很不错。缺点：1、电梯速度特别慢，上楼需要10分钟。电梯太慢了，让人无法忍受。2、早餐9点就结束了，而且早餐非常单一，只有包子、榨菜、米粥。这相当于招待所。3、大堂的面积有些小。大堂的厕所也太小了。,"The Mianzhou Hotel is one of the best hotels in Mianyang, but after all, it is a four -star, and the quality cannot be too good.Advantages: 1. Good service attitude, accept credit card payment.2. The location is superior, in the center of the city, near shopping malls, railway stations, and municipal governments.3. There are abundant taxis, and the parking lot area is large.The Chinese restaurant on the 4th and 3rd floor is good.The taste is good, the price is preferential, it is worth eating.5. The room area is particularly large, and it is very comfortable to live.The bathroom is also very good.Disadvantages: 1. The elevator speed is particularly slow, and it takes 10 minutes to go upstairs.The elevator is too slow to bear.2. The breakfast is over at 9 o'clock, and breakfast is very single, only buns, mustard, rice porridge.This is equivalent to a guest house.3. The area of the lobby is somewhat small.The toilet in the lobby is too small."
1,"酒店位置很不错,而且在市中心,对面是人民公园.而且有直通班车到罗浮山的绵州温泉酒店,如有时间,值得去温泉酒店泡泡.","The location of the hotel is very good, and in the city center, the opposite people's park. There is also a direct bus to the Mianzhou Hot Spring Hotel in Luofu Mountain. If you have time, it is worth going to the hot spring hotel bubble."
1,根据网评预定400一天标房，到店告知携程协议价只能住西北朝向房间，感到有点霉味，要求换房，换后还是西北向不过楼层高些，霉味小些；房间窗户、家具、卫生间都是旧款，不显档次，床很舒服；服务不错，感觉楼层比前台服务更好；酒店周围环境真好，有山有海，本人在后山散步时差点掉下悬崖，建议酒店及时将后山半截路加上标志和围挡，太危险了！夜间行走和小孩子玩耍更危险！,"According to the online review of 400 a day, the standard room is scheduled to inform the Ctrip agreement price to live in the northwest dynasty. I feel a bit moldy. I ask for a house to change the house.The bathrooms are all old models, no grades, and the bed is very comfortable; the service is good, and the floor is better than the front desk service; the surrounding environment of the hotel is really good, there are mountains and sea, I almost drop the cliff when walking in the back mountain.It is too dangerous to add a signs and enclosure in Houshan halfway roads in time!Walking at night is more dangerous to play with children!"
1,我经常入住这家酒店。这是我认为在绵阳性价比最好的酒店,I often stay in this hotel.This is the hotel I think is the best cost -effective hotel
1,9月30日第一次住这个酒店，总体感觉这个酒店很不错，下次去绵阳我还会住这个酒店。优点：1、酒店的硬件设施非常好，处处给人很舒服的感觉2、早餐也很丰富，味道也很不错3、从酒店铺的厚厚的地毯和赠送的咖啡看得出酒店的细心与周到缺点：1、后院有个酒吧，虽然不是很吵但给人的感觉不好2、前台的服务态度一般,"I stayed in this hotel for the first time on September 30. Overall I feel that this hotel is very good. Next time I go to Mianyang, I will still stay in this hotel.Advantages: 1. The hotel's hardware facilities are very good, and they feel comfortable everywhere. 2. Breakfast is also very good. The taste is also very good. 3. From the thick carpets of the hotel and the gift of coffee, you can see the care of the hotel.Throughout the disadvantages: 1. There is a bar in the backyard."
1,酒店地理位置好，周边环境不错。酒店内设施很好。房间比较宽敞，特别是商务大床间的性价比较高。房间干净，毛巾、浴巾比较新。餐厅饭菜品种较多。,"The hotel has a good geographical location and the surrounding environment is good.The facilities in the hotel are very good.The room is relatively spacious, especially the cost of the large business bed is relatively high.The room is clean, and the towels and bath towels are relatively new.There are many types of meals in restaurants."
1,酒店离机场较近，对时间紧凑的客人来说是个不错的选择。大堂吧的咖啡和点心不错，服务很好，价格合适！,"The hotel is closer to the airport, which is a good choice for guests with compact time.The coffee and snacks of the lobby bar are good, the service is good, the price is suitable!"
1,"房间挺大,条件也可以,就是通过携程无早餐,自订狂贵,而且价格也多变,一会收30,一会收48,各部门之间又缺乏联系,送的软饮,结帐时有要收费,软件服务要跟上,不过总体还可以.","The room is quite large, and the conditions are also OK. It is through the no breakfast through Ctrip, the self -order is expensive, and the price is also changed. After receiving 30, it will receive 48 in a while.There is a fee, the software service must be kept up, but the overall is OK."
1,该酒店性价比较高，还能免费上网打电话，虽然我们最后没有使用，但是还是值得向大家推荐。,"The hotel is relatively cost -effective and can call online for free. Although we did not use it in the end, it is still worth recommending to everyone."
1,位置是非常好，就在省政府对面，离步行街也很近，但房间内的条件太一般，达不到四星。我住的是398元的，还没包早餐，最多也就值200元，不过酒店能到机场接客确实很不错。如果住一晚也值了，如果住三晚以上，还是选择别的实惠一点的酒店吧。现在我才发现，通过携程网订房价格很没优势的，都是提高了价格后再折扣，折后价格比不上其他的普通酒店，以后还是要自己直接跟别的酒店联系，省了中间环节，价格会低很多，并且条件还会更好。,"The position is very good. It is opposite the provincial government and is very close to the walking street, but the conditions in the room are too average to meet the four stars.I live at 398 yuan, and I haven't included breakfast yet, and it is worth 200 yuan, but the hotel can pick up customers at the airport. It is really good.If you live for one night, you will be worth more than three nights, and choose another affordable hotel.Now I discovered that the price of the booking of Ctrip.com is very advantageous. They all increase the price and then discount. After the discount, the price is not as good as other ordinary hotels. In the future, I still have to contact other hotels by themselves.The price will be much lower and the conditions will be better."
1,"遗漏了东西在酒店,多亏服务人员的告之,在这里表示感谢","I missed things at the hotel, thanks to the service staff, here I express my gratitude"
1,"地理位置有点偏,出行除打车外不是很方便,离地铁站也有点距离",The geographical location is a bit biased. It is not very convenient to travel except for taxis. It is also a bit of a distance from the subway station.
1,"酒店环境幽雅，服务很好，价格合理,综合条件都不错。","The hotel environment is elegant, the service is good, the price is reasonable, and the comprehensive conditions are good."
1,酒店房间设施比较现代，服务人员从前台到行政楼层餐厅服务生都非常训练有素。虽然酒店位置是在住宅区，相对较远，但是环境安静。同时，附近有大拇指广场，吃饭休闲都不是问题,"The hotel room facilities are relatively modern, and the waiters of the service staff from the front desk to the administrative floor restaurant waiters are very well trained.Although the hotel location is in the residential area, relatively far away, the environment is quiet.At the same time, there is a thumbs square nearby, and eating and leisure are not a problem."
1,在杭州住过几家四星五星的酒店，维景还算不错。服务态度不冷也不热，能过得去。客房装修也能接受。,"There have been several four -star and five -star hotels in Hangzhou, and the scenery is pretty good.The service attitude is not cold or hot, and you can live.The room decoration can also be accepted."
1,"从入住到离开,都很满意,下次来杭州一定还会入住的.宾馆反馈2008年6月24日：感谢您对酒店的评价，这对我们而言是最受鼓舞的客人反馈。期待您的再次光临！","From staying to leaving, I am very satisfied. Next time I come to Hangzhou, I will still stay in. Hotel feedback on June 24, 2008: Thank you for your evaluation of the hotel, which is the most encouraged guest to feedback us.welcome next time!"
1,宾馆的位置不错，可是房间里面设施比较陈旧，特别是卫生间，其他的都还不错，离西湖比较近。稍稍有点意见的是饭店的洗衣房居然也下班，而且我的衣服都装到袋子里面了，只是没有填上是普通洗还是快洗，就没有被服务员拿去洗。宾馆反馈2008年6月12日：酒店洗衣房的客衣洗衣工作时间为8：00-21：00。如果有特急物品，也可以通知大堂副理处理。有些客人喜欢将脏衣服暂时放入酒店的洗衣袋内，并非需要酒店清洗。也有过多起这种洗衣，事后客人认为没有这种需要，并在清洗过程中耽误客人的时间。因此，酒店在清理房间时，如果客人不填写洗衣单，是不收取衣服进行清洗。我们也尝试对这样的情况，对客人进行留言，再次确认需求情况。,"The hotel's location is good, but the facilities in the room are relatively old, especially the bathroom. The others are not bad, closer to West Lake.A little bit of opinion is that the laundry room of the hotel is actually off work, and my clothes are put in the bag, but if you do n’t fill it with ordinary washing or fast washing, you will not be washed by the waiter.Hotel feedback on June 12, 2008: The customer laundry working time of the hotel laundry room is 8: 00-21: 00.If there are special items, you can also notify the deputy manager of the lobby.Some guests like to temporarily put dirty clothes into the laundry bag of the hotel, and do not need hotel cleaning.There are too many kinds of laundry. Afterwards, the guests thought that there was no such need, and the time of delaying the guests during the cleaning process.Therefore, when the hotel is cleaning up the room, if the guest does not fill in the laundry list, it will not collect clothes for cleaning.We also tried to leave a message to the guests and confirm the demand again."
1,"合庆的商务单间可以堪称豪华,设施特别先进，特别是少有的先进马桶,很少酒店有这样的装备.价格也可以接受","Heqing's business single room can be called luxurious, and the facilities are particularly advanced, especially the rare advanced toilet. Few hotels have such equipment. The price can be acceptable"
1,因为春秋航空晚点6个小时，到酒店的时候已经快凌晨2点了。期间打了两个电话给酒店，请求延迟入住时间，前台小姐比较热心的告诉了我机场到酒店需要的出租车费，避免给人很宰一刀。房间硬件不错，服务也很好。,"Because Spring Airlines is 6 hours later, it is almost 2 am when I arrive at the hotel.During the period, I called the hotel and requested delaying the check -in time. The lady at the front desk told me that the taxi fee required to get to the hotel at the hotel was more enthusiastic to avoid being very slaughtered.The room has good hardware and good service."
1,服务算是热情周到，早餐尚可，卫生间够大的,"The service is enthusiastic and thoughtful, breakfast is okay, the bathroom is large enough"
1,我是7号入住的豪华商务间优点：1.位置较好，交通方便。2.出现问题后能及时沟通，服务较好。（详见后）不足：1.有部分豪华商务房由所谓的“家庭套房”改造而成（两个房间有一个木门连接），隔音效果非常差。2.房间内有霉味。其他：我预定的598的豪华商务房，checkin时没有告之我该房是由所谓的“家庭套房”改造而成，结果入住后发现隔音非常差，隔壁的男士在和一女士通电话，在我房间内甚至可以听到那个女士的说话声，呵呵。经交涉后调换了房间，问题得以解决，在交涉过程中服务态度不错，但个人认为应从根本上杜绝此类问题出现。,"I am the advantages of luxury business that I stayed on the 7th: 1. The location is better and the traffic is convenient.2. You can communicate in time after a problem, and the service is better.(See it for details) Insufficient: 1. Some luxury business houses are transformed from the so -called ""family suite"" (two rooms have a wooden door connection), and the sound insulation effect is very poor.2. Mold smell in the room.Others: I have a 598 luxury business house. When Checkin, I did not tell me that the room was transformed by the so -called ""family suite"". As a result, the sound insulation was very poor after check -in.I can even hear the lady's speech in my room, haha.After the negotiations were changed, the problem was resolved. During the negotiation process, the service attitude was good, but I personally believe that such problems should be fundamentally eliminated."
1,虽然酒店比较陈旧，但整体服务很好，遇事处理反应很快，交通也便利，下次来还会选择入住这里。,"Although the hotel is relatively old, the overall service is very good, the response is very fast in case of trouble, and the traffic is convenient. Next time, I will choose to stay here."
1,看了携程网上大家评价如此之高才定了这家酒店，先说有点：1，酒店位置好，就在植物园边，去哪个景点都很方便；2，餐饮起家的酒店，餐饮非常方便，味道好，价格公道，早餐品种很多。3，服务态度好，非常主动。再说说不住之处：1，酒店的硬件：外观象个招待所，房间内装没有特色，墙纸有些脱离，地毯色深且有些斑点；2，外幕墙隔音不太好（是指外墙不是内部的二结构墙）。1楼角落有个卸货平台，每天早上6：30有车进来卸货，引擎声，嘈杂声（倒车！倒车！停！停！！）象个闹钟。总的来说还是不错，只是硬件稍有不足之处。听说在前浦造新楼，营业后一定会去住住。,"After watching Ctrip.com, everyone commented on this hotel. This hotel is set.Okay, fair price, a lot of breakfast varieties.3. Good service attitude and very active.Besides, I ca n’t hold it: 1. The hardware of the hotel: the appearance is like a guest house, there is no characteristic of the room, the wallpaper is somewhat separated, the carpet is dark and some spots;Two structure walls).There is a unloading platform on the first floor. Every morning at 6:30 in the morning, a car comes in unloading.In general, it is still good, but the hardware is slightly short.I heard that in Qianpu New Building, I will definitely live after business."
1,此酒店在问题处理上不够积极。还好我是在携程订的。携程的服务确实有大公司的风范。后期的服务跟进很到位。对于酒店，我就不多说了。诚信永远是发展之道,"This hotel is not active enough in terms of problems.Fortunately, I booked it in Ctrip.Ctrip's service does have the style of large companies.The follow -up service follow -up is in place.I won't say much about the hotel.Integrity is always the way of development"
1,"每次去济南我都会住在山东大厦.酒店设施周到完善,服务员服务到位,很多细节上凸显了酒店的人性化考虑,总之,非常满意!","Every time I go to Jinan, I will live in Shandong Building. The hotel facilities are thoughtful and perfect, and the service staff services are in place. Many details highlight the humanity of the hotel. In short, I am very satisfied!"
1,环境真好，面向大海，幽静，适合休闲度假，可惜只住了一晚。地点较偏，自驾比较方便。酒店用餐太贵，开车出去吃了。,"The environment is so good, facing the sea, quiet, suitable for leisure vacation, unfortunately only stayed for one night.The location is more biased, and it is more convenient to drive by car.The meal of the hotel is too expensive, and I drive out for a while."
1,其他都很不错，就是叫出租不是太方便~,"Everything else is very good, it is not too convenient to ask rental ~"
1,定济南酒店之前看大家的点评，山东大厦好评最多，以我这次亲身体会，可谓名副其实。山东大厦的好处，首先胜在环境。记得小时候语文课本里老舍关于济南的文章吗？随着城市的发展，那些“环抱济南的小山”现在已经被城市包围，但保留了绿树葱葱，山东大厦就在它们的拱卫中。而在近处，大厦北面一路之隔，就是济南植物园，更是满目绿色。我住在1716房间，窗外景色开阔，完全没有他楼上目光的逼迫，黄昏时俯瞰植物园慢慢昏暗下去，不远处夕阳落下山坳，感觉有些微醺。山东大厦另一好处，是正宗的波特曼式中庭空间。波特曼是上世纪美国以旅馆设计著称的建筑师，尤其擅长共享空间的设计，上海的上海商城就是他的作品，但上海商城的中庭还不如山东大厦来的原滋原味，值得在其中体会一番。应该说山东大厦的政府背景有一定关系，现在的纯粹商业资本也许已舍不得用这样的大手笔作中庭，另外防火审查也很难批下来。房间不奢华，但舒适。电视是43寸液晶，另有台式电脑提供免费上网。最喜欢的是内阳台上的休息区，发发呆很不错。当然小问题还是有的，浴缸排水口在水流冲击时会散发霉味。,"Ding Jinan Hotel has read everyone's comments before, and Shandong Building has the most praised. It can be described as my own experience.The benefits of Shandong Building are first wins the environment.Remember the articles about Jinan in the Chinese textbook when he was a kid?With the development of the city, those ""hovering in Jinan"" are now surrounded by cities, but the green trees are retained, and Shandong Building is in their arch guards.Nearly, the north of the building is separated by the Jinan Botanical Garden, which is even more green.I live in Room 1716, and the scenery outside the window is wide, and there is no persecution of his eyes upstairs. At dusk, the botanical garden is slowly dim.Another benefit of Shandong Building is the authentic Portman -style atrium space.Portman is an architect that is known for the design of the hotel in the last century. It is particularly good at the design of sharing space. Shanghai Mall in Shanghai is his work, but the atrium of Shanghai Mall is not as good as the original flavor of Shandong Building.One time.It should be said that the government background of the Shandong Building has a certain relationship. Now the pure commercial capital may be reluctant to use such a large hand as an atrium, and it is difficult to criticize the fire prevention review.The room is not luxurious, but comfortable.TV is 43 -inch LCD, and there are also desktop computers to provide free Internet access.The favorite is the lounge area on the balcony, which is very good.Of course, there are small problems. The bathtub drainage port will emit mold smell when the water flows."
1,合庆确实不错，我住的商务单间，房间很大，设施很齐全，很温馨的感觉。尤其让我满意的是酒店后边的小山，沿着小路一直走上去，很多树，还有一些盛开的小花，小山的一侧就是清澈的海水，远处是一些小岛，尤其在夏天去，感觉非常舒服。下次一定还住合庆。,"Heqing is really good. The business single room I live is large, the room is very large, the facilities are complete, and a very warm feeling.What is particularly satisfied with is the hill behind the hotel, always walking along the path, many trees, and some blooming small flowers. On the side of the hills is clear sea water, there are some small islands in the distance, especially in the summer.very comfortable.Next time, I must live in Heqing."
1,拖鞋不错哦，很舒服，颜色也不错，大床很舒服，软硬适中，房间温度也好，在大东区地点稍偏，不过不远处有大小什街，都是吃的，特别一家狗肉馆，不错不错！在五星里面，价格算较低的了，下次还想住那里,"The slippers are good, very comfortable, the color is also good, the big bed is very comfortable, the soft and hardness is moderate, the room temperature is also good, but there are small and small streets in Dadong District, but they are eaten.,Not bad!In the five -star, the price is low, and I want to live there next time"
1,"酒店的硬件没得说可以说是一流.对其硬件非常的满意但是他们东北的服务意识真的让我怎么说,就那样了,.因为东北太干了加上他们空调的暖气开的较高,早上我起来流鼻血了,等我退房他们前台居然告诉我他们酒店有加湿器可以使用,天哪!我向他们反映时没有人和我说有加湿器等我退房了居然说可以使用加湿器来使人体在干燥的房间里舒服一点!MyGod!Nothingtosay!","The hotel's hardware is not said to be first -class. It is very satisfied with their hardware, but the service consciousness of their Northeast really makes me say, because the Northeast is too dry and the heating of their air -conditioning is higher.In the morning, I got up and nosebleed. When I got out of the room, they actually told me that their hotel had a humidifier to use. Oh my god! No one told me that there was a humidifier waiting for me to wait for me to check out that I could use it. I said that I can use it.The humidifier makes the human body comfortable in a dry room! MyGOD! Nothingtosay!"
1,此酒店有欺诈客人的嫌疑！房间的MINI吧里，所有的饮料均标有价格，惟有放在小桌上的矿泉水没有标价，并在该矿泉水旁还有友情提示：用此水泡咖啡味道更佳。我们误以为这是免费的，就用了1大瓶2小瓶。不想在结帐时被告知此矿泉水是收费的，费用高达168元！,"This hotel is suspected of fraudulent guests!In the MINI bar of the room, all the beverages are marked with the price. Only the mineral water on the small table is not marked, and there is a friendly tip next to the mineral water: it is better to use this soaked coffee.We mistakenly thought that this was free, so we used 1 large bottle and 2 small bottles.I don't want to be told that the mineral water is charged at the checkout, and the cost is as high as 168 yuan!"
1,4月30日入住会所房，大概经过多次博螯论坛的磨练，酒店终于达到了超五星的标准。房间硬件没的说，超级大，泡在浴缸可以看到万泉河、玉带滩，只是淋浴房门漏水，满地都是湿的。绒布拖鞋质量很好也很舒服，单独的行李房很不错。另外提一句，入住该酒店的话可以以将近一半的折扣价买博螯论坛会址的门票。最最赞的，还得是酒店旁的高尔夫球场，太棒了。环境很美，秋道很宽，能够给打球人无比的自信，呵呵，LG还连打了两个birdy。很多人去海南就知道去三亚挤，大概都还没有发现博螯这块度假的宝地，我们还会再去的。,"In the clubhouse on April 30, the hotel finally reached the standard of super five stars after many disciplines from the Bolachi Forum.The hardware of the room is not large. It is super large. You can see the Wanquan River and Jade Beach soaked in the bathtub, but the door of the shower room is leaking, and the ground is wet.The quality of the velvet slippers is very good and comfortable, and the separate luggage room is very good.In addition, if you stay in the hotel, you can buy tickets at the site of the Bolachi Forum at nearly half of the discount price.The best is the golf course next to the hotel, which is great.The environment is very beautiful, and the Qiu Dao is very wide. It can give the players extremely confident. Hehe, LG also hit two Birdy.Many people know that they go to Sanya to squeeze in Hainan, and we probably have not found the treasure land of Bolachi, and we will go again."
1,"房间紧张---由于地理位置,这个酒店的房间通常都很紧张.房价高---285虽然不多，但是要记住这个是经济型酒店.在这个价位不太经济.布局好---本次的房间有一个办公桌,足够大,比以前在电视前面打电脑要好多了.服务一般---这个如家根本没有任何服务可言.推荐入住.","The room is tight --- Due to the geographical location, the room of this hotel is usually very tight. Hall prices are high-although there are not many houses, but remember that this is a economical hotel. It is not economical at this price. The layout is good----------------There is a desk in this room, which is much big enough, which is much better than playing a computer in front of the TV. The service is average --- this home without any service at all. Recommended."
1,位于徐家汇中心地段，房价经济实惠，环境也很好呢！,"Located in the center of Xujiahui, the house price is economical and the environment is also very good!"
1,有一点不太满意，就是酒店的早餐秩序较乱，服务跟不上，餐桌不能及时清理，导致客人经常没有桌子用餐，入住的几天都是这样，不知是因为过年，服务员都放假了？如果是这样，倒也有情可谅。希望下次不会遇到这种情况。其它的酒店服务都比较满意。,"One is not very satisfied, that is, the hotel's breakfast order is more chaotic, the service cannot keep up, and the dining table cannot be cleaned in time. As a result, guests often have no tables to dine. The days of staying are like this. I wonder if the waiters are on vacation because of the New Year?If so, there is also enlightenment.I hope this will not be encountered next time.Other hotel services are relatively satisfactory."
1,房间干净舒适，是出差、旅游度假的理想之选。服务业很不错。,"The room is clean and comfortable, and it is an ideal choice for business trips and travel and vacations.The service industry is very good."
1,"很宽敞,非常好的地方。如果可能的话，希望能把洗脸处的存水盖子修理好。应该是件简单的事。","Very spacious and very good place.If possible, I hope to repair the storage lid in the face.It should be a simple matter."
1,我们东莞旭豪机械有限公司此次前来上海参加7月27―7月31日在新国际博览中心举办的中国国际纺织机械展览会，一行5人，通过携程旅游网帮我们推荐入住中信五牛城酒店公寓。不得不佩服携程的专业，帮我们推荐的五牛城酒店商务三房刚好可以住5人而且互不影响，有2套卫浴使用，还有一个近40平方米的客厅供我们晚上商量事务或打牌娱乐。酒店离新国际博览中心很近很方便，地处浦东陆家嘴地区，晚上我们出去逛街购物都很方便，交通也便捷，总之，这样的酒店公寓对我们这样的商务小型团队非常适合，也很经济实惠，我要把这家酒店公寓介绍给我们生意上的中外伙伴们，下次再来上海出差或家庭旅游我还选择中信五牛城酒店公寓，相信我，你们住五牛城酒店公寓不但少花钱而且绝对不丢面子！,"Our Dongguan Xuhao Machinery Co., Ltd. came to Shanghai to participate in the China International Textile Machinery Exhibition held at the New International Expo Center on July 27th to July 31st at the New International Expo Center. A group of 5 people recommended to stay in CITIC Wuniu through Ctrip.City hotel apartment.I have to admire the major of Ctrip to help us recommend the three -bedroom business of Wu Niocheng Hotel, which can only live in 5 people and does not affect each other. There are 2 sets of bathrooms, and a nearly 40 -square -meter living room for us to discuss affairs or play cards at night or play cards.entertainment.The hotel is very close to the New International Expo Center. It is located in the Lujiazui area of Pudong. It is very convenient to go out and shopping at night, and the traffic is convenient., I want to introduce this hotel apartment to our business partners in business. Next time I come to Shanghai for business trip or family travel, I also choose CITIC Wu Niocheng Hotel Apartment. Believe me, you live in Wu Niocheng Hotel Apartment not only spend less moneyAnd never lose face!"
1,感谢五牛城，给我一次非常舒适的旅行。我们一共4人订了标准的二室一厅，周围环境很好，从窗户可以看到黄浦江以及东方明珠、金茂大厦。唯一的缺点是刚进去的时候，气味很冲，不过开了空调后过一会就好了。交通也很便利，附近路口就有公交车站，离地铁口也不远。宾馆反馈2008年8月5日：非常感谢您的评价。关于您提到气味问题，我们会督促员工加强客房通风工作，希望您再次入住时能给您一个清新的环境。,"Thanks to Wu Niocheng for a very comfortable trip for me.A total of 4 people have a standard second room and one living room. The surrounding environment is very good. From the windows, we can see Huangpu River and Oriental Pearls and Jinmao Building.The only disadvantage was that when I first entered, the smell was very rushing, but it would be fine after turning on the air conditioner.The transportation is also very convenient. There is a bus station at the nearby intersection, not far from the subway entrance.Hotel feedback on August 5, 2008: Thank you very much for your evaluation.Regarding the smell problem you mentioned, we will urge employees to strengthen the ventilation of the guest rooms. I hope you can give you a fresh environment when you stay in again."
1,这次是参加浦东新国际博览中心的会议，在网上查看到这个酒店的酒店距离展会十分近，打车才20元出头，酒店设施比以前有所改善，还免费帮我升级了房型，另外还送了免费游泳券让我在炎炎夏日里凉爽了一把。听前台人员介绍，近期还推出了麻将、OK房等休闲房，如果下次有朋友聚会，可以考虑入住这么价廉物美的酒店。宾馆反馈2008年8月5日：非常感谢您的评价。希望通过我们自身不断的整改和活动举措的不断推出，能吸引您和您的朋友再次光临！,"This time I participated in the meeting of Pudong New International Expo Center. I checked on the Internet that the hotel's hotel was very close to the exhibition. It was only 20 yuan for a taxi. The hotel facilities were improved than before.The free swimming coupon made me cool in the hot summer.Listening to the front desk staff, there have been recently launched leisure rooms such as Mahjong and OK rooms. If there is a friend's party next time, you can consider staying in such a cheerful hotel.Hotel feedback on August 5, 2008: Thank you very much for your evaluation.It is hoped that through the continuous launch of our own continuous rectification and activities, it can attract you and your friends to come again!"
1,酒店地段较好，我选择的行政大床房，感觉房间设计挺好的，比较有温馨感，总体入住的感觉不错，性价比总体上还是较好的。下次应该还会入住,"The hotel location is good. The administrative big bed room I choose to feel is very good in the room design, more warm, and feel good for staying in. The cost performance is generally better.I should still stay next time"
1,周末出游订了这里的行政房，卧室和客厅有隔墙分开很雅致，室内的装潢以玫瑰红和黑色为主，感觉像是蜜月房，另有台式电脑。唯一不理想的是卫生间和卧室仅用玻璃分开，私密性不足。总体感觉很好，很喜欢里面的大浴缸。,"The administrative houses here are booked here on weekends. The bedrooms and living rooms are separated from the wall. The interior decoration is mainly rose red and black. It feels like a honeymoon room and a desktop computer.The only unsatisfactory thing is that the bathroom and the bedroom are only separated by glass, and the privacy is insufficient.Overall feels good, I like the big bathtub inside."
1,"我订的是298元的大床房,客观的评价说:1、房间装修还是蛮有特色的，深颜色为主，面积有点小，我想可能豪华大床房会要大点去吧，卫生间是透明的玻璃，有布帘，夫妻或情侣住住还是很不错的。2、地理位置很不错的，去西湖不远的，走走就到了3、房间还是很干净的，液晶电视，4、前台结帐有点乱，时间蛮长的，希望能加强一点","I ordered a large bed room of 298 yuan. Objectively evaluating: 1. The room decoration is still quite distinctive. The dark color is the main and the area is a bit small. I think it may be a bigger luxury bed room.It is a transparent glass with a curtain, and the couple or couple lives very well.2. The geographical location is very good, not far from the West Lake, the room is still very clean. LCD TV, 4. The front desk is a bit messy, and the time is quite long. I hope to strengthen a little bit."
1,去的之前只打了一个晚上的酒店，后来由于种种原因就决定再住一晚。随之在携程上找了米兰，到了酒店之后，感觉很温馨。装修也很人性化，房间虽小，但格调很喜欢，唯一的不好就是太靠马路，晚上有点吵。但离西湖很近，我们是走过去的，因为是闹市所以不觉得远。总之很喜欢，下次还会来住的……,"Before I went, I only hit the hotel for one night, and later decided to stay for another night for various reasons.Then I found Milan on Ctrip. After arriving at the hotel, I felt very warm.The decoration is also very user -friendly. Although the room is small, the style likes it. The only bad thing is that it is too much on the road, and it is a bit noisy at night.But it's close to West Lake. We walked over because we didn't feel far because of the market.In short, I like it very much, I will live next time ..."
1,我们定的是特价大床房，很幸运，去了就免费升级成豪华大床房了。位于四楼，房间还算宽敞，而且很干净。我喜欢洗手间的玻璃屏风，这样显得整个房间比较大。不喜欢透明的话还可以放下卷帘。这儿的床很好。床旁边的台灯也漂亮。唯一毛病是淋浴房门无法合紧，洗澡的时候要拽着门，防止水溅出。好在只住一晚，这点小困难还可以克服。总的来讲，三百元就住到这样的旅馆，性价比已经非常好了。,"We set a special large bed room. Fortunately, we went to the luxury bed room for free.Located on the fourth floor, the room is quite spacious and clean.I like the glass screen of the toilet, so that the whole room is relatively large.If you don't like transparent, you can also put down the roller.The bed here is very good.The table lamp next to the bed is also beautiful.The only problem is that the shower house door cannot be closed. When taking a bath, drag the door to prevent water from splashing.Fortunately, just stay for one night, this small difficulty can be overcome.Generally speaking, 300 yuan stays in such a hotel, and the price / performance performance is already very good."
1,"环境很美,很静,有山有水,十分暇逸.感觉比住在山上好,因为有水.位置就在山脚下,绕过水库左转就上山了.到山脚5公里,上山23公里路.就是房间太小,而且隔音不好,隔壁的电话在响,我老以为是我们房间的电话.刷卡不方便,最后还是付了现","The environment is beautiful, very quiet, there are mountains and water, and it is very timeful. It feels better than living on the mountain, because there is water. The location is at the foot of the mountain. Turning around the reservoir to the left and up the mountain.The road. The room is too small, and the sound insulation is not good. The phone next door is rang. I always think that the phone in our room. It is not convenient to swipe the card. Finally, I paid it."
1,"5天前的是市景房,酒店自升湖景房前台,僮,中西餐服都很好,商中心的女孩非常,然房修比,非平面型,但是用,清,床被很清,舒服,水也很清,中餐格也合理,位置很好,物方便,(但西湖有距,所以房景也有失望)不300多元是值得,(以前少有500元以下的酒店有如此高水平)下次去杭州都入住(不僮代叫到司宰了120元,此外,餐早餐段外客人提供刀叉,人家做手抓人)宾馆反馈2008年8月15日：客人的认可是我们努力的目标，我们会加强服务的细致化，人性化。早餐的刀叉用具放在西点处可能不明显，我们对没有及时关注到客人的需求表示歉意，欢迎您的再次光临。（参考信息：1.客人可乘坐民航大巴前往机场，15元/人次，酒店步行至上车点5分钟路程；2.门僮提供代叫出租车服务，客人可要求司机打计程表前往目的地。）","Five days ago, the city scenery house, the hotel from the front desk of the lake scene, children, Chinese and Western dining clothes were very good, the girls in the business center were very, but the house repair ratio, the non -plane type, but the use, clear, the bed was very clearIt is comfortable, the water is very clear, the Chinese food is reasonable, the location is very good, and the material is convenient.

We apologize to the needs of the guests in time. Welcome to visit again.(Reference information: 1. Guests can take the civil aviation bus to the airport, 15 yuan/person, the hotel walks to the boarding point for 5 minutes;).)"
1,"酒店的位置很好,就在市中心,杭百和银泰边上，购物和交通很方便。这次本人住在24楼，居然在高处看到大半个西湖。只是可能酒店建成时间较久，房间里的设施较陈旧，卫生间装修不敢恭维，地毯也已经有点污迹斑斑了。不过房间里的软件配备还挺齐全，有免费供应的咖啡和立顿红茶，雨伞，小冰箱，保险箱，还有浴袍等。另外，楼顶旋转餐厅的自助早餐已经取消，现改在五楼餐厅了。早餐的品种也比较丰富，可能有所改进了。总之，作为四星级饭店，性价比还可以，以后还会继续入住的。宾馆反馈2008年7月29日：感谢您对酒店的支持，我们会对设施设备逐步加以改进，酒店欢迎您再次入住。","The hotel's location is very good, just in the city center, Hangbai and Intime, shopping and transportation are very convenient.This time I lived on the 24th floor and actually saw most of the West Lake on the heights.It is just that the hotel may be completed for a long time, the facilities in the room are old, the bathroom decoration dare not compliment, and the carpet is already a bit stained.However, the software in the room is quite complete. There are free coffee and Litton black tea, umbrella, small refrigerator, safe, and bathrobe.In addition, the buffet breakfast of the dining restaurant on the top has been canceled, and it is now changed to the fifth floor restaurant.Breakfast varieties are also relatively rich, and may be improved.In short, as a four -star hotel, the price -performance ratio is okay, and it will continue to stay in the future.Hotel feedback on July 29, 2008: Thank you for your support to the hotel. We will gradually improve the facilities and equipment. The hotel is welcome to stay in again."
1,位置优越，出行方便。就是房间较小，床位较小，房间装修较旧，其他方面都不错。,"The location is superior and the travel is convenient.That is, the room is small, the beds are small, the room decoration is old, and other aspects are good."
1,定的特惠房，看网上评价不是很好，有点犹豫，但是离我办事的银泰百货非常的近，所以还是定了。比想象中的好！虽然有些旧了，不过还是很干净的，服务员态度也挺好的。早餐也不错。下次还会住那里的。宾馆反馈2008年6月5日：感谢您对酒店的支持，我们会继续努力提高服务质量，同时加强对设施设备的改建和维护，酒店欢迎您的再次入住。,"The fixed special room, watching the online evaluation is not very good, hesitant, but Intime Department Store, who is doing business, is very close, so it is still fixed.A better than expected!Although it is old, it is still very clean, and the waiter attitude is pretty good.Breakfast is also good.I will live there next time.Hotel feedback on June 5, 2008: Thank you for your support for the hotel. We will continue to work hard to improve the quality of service, and at the same time strengthen the reconstruction and maintenance of facilities and equipment. The hotel welcomes you to stay again."
1,还好。相比而言感觉比美丽华强。早餐不错，德州扒鸡已经吃腻了。,"fine.In contrast, it feels stronger than beauty.Breakfast is good, Texas has been tired of picking chicken."
1,入住398元的高级房，性价比较差。房顶墙皮象鱼鳞般翘起，现在想起来都觉得麻人。卫生间设施比较陈旧。补充点评2008年4月15日：怎么系统给打了4分，我觉得至多值个3分。,"Checking in high -end houses of 398 yuan, the cost is poor.The roof wall leather fish scales were raised, and now they think Mairen.The bathroom facilities are relatively old.Supplementary comment on April 15, 2008: How to give the system 4 points, I think it is worth 3 points."
1,"入住A栋,房间很大,面海的房间还有大阳台.房间内设施全新,服务周到贴心.早餐品种丰富,味道很好.酒店离海外很近,对面过了马路穿过一个小公园就到了.","Check in Building A, the room is very large, there are large balconies in the room in the sea. The facilities in the room are new, and the service is thoughtful and intimate. The breakfast variety is rich and the taste is very good. The hotel is very close to overseas.arrive."
1,酒店位置不错！服务可以！只是楼下是酒家，油烟味太重！晚上夜宵人声稍大!,The hotel location is good!Service!It's just a restaurant downstairs. The smell of oil fume is too heavy!The supper is louder at night!
1,在这里住了两晚，由于下雨，有点湿气，我订的是江景房，视野很好，虽然在西街上，但因为离热闹的中心地带还有些距离，所以晚上还是很安静的。边上就是大师傅和一块瓦比较有名的餐饮店，对面就是九九车行，交通非常便利，离汽车站走路就三分钟。只是房间里没有宽带，但可以租用，10元/天。,"I lived here for two nights. Because it was raining, I was a little moist. I ordered the Jiangjing Fang. The field of vision was very good. Although it was on the West Street, because there was still some distance from the lively center, I was still quiet at night.On the side is the master and a well -known restaurant with tiles. On the opposite side is the Jiu or 9 car bank. The transportation is very convenient. It takes three minutes to walk away from the bus station.It is just that there is no broadband in the room, but it can be rented, 10 yuan/day."
1,住的248的大床房，南苑楼虽然有些旧，但是房间很干净，入住期间碰上市人大会议在南苑召开，政府的官僚作风禁止出租进入，影响到其他住客要拖着行李从大门走到大堂，非常不方便。南苑最大的问题是吃饭非常不方便以及打车很困难，其他方面比较满意，早餐种类很丰富。补充点评2008年4月12日：点评完看到楼下客服回复的，出租车事宜再次入住有很大的惊喜，距今已经4个月了，我看情况没有任何改变，还不能打车到门口。,"Although the large bed room where it lives, although the Nanyuan Tower is a bit old, the room is very clean. During the check -in, the meeting of the people was held in Nanyuan.It is very inconvenient to walk to the lobby.Nanyuan's biggest problem is that eating is very inconvenient and difficult to take a taxi. Other aspects are relatively satisfactory, and the types of breakfast are rich.Supplementary comment on April 12, 2008: After the review, I saw the customer service downstairs reply. There was a lot of surprises to stay in the taxi again. It has been 4 months since I see. I see that the situation has not changed. I can't take a taxi to the door.Essence"
1,酒店依山势而建，前面就是长江，环境很棒。大堂也很气派，服务也很热情。住的218的标准间，房间内设施及家具款式都比较老式，但很干净，没有之前人说的老鼠的问题。唯一不足的是酒店交通很不方便，根本没有出租车在那里等客，除非正好有人打车过来，否则只能自己走出去，大概要走10分钟。第一天吃饭是自己走出去的，第二天去机场提早了半小时让服务台叫车，结果等了半小时也没来，差点误机。吃饭也是比较头痛的问题，附近没找到什么吃饭的地方。另外建议去泸州的朋友，如果是晚上到泸州，又是只身一人，最好是坐机场大巴到市区，比的士要安全些。机场出来的那条路黑嘛嘛没有路灯，如果碰到打劫之类，真是叫天天不应，叫地地不灵。机场到酒店打车21元。,"The hotel is built on the mountain, and the Yangtze River is in front, and the environment is great.The lobby is also very elegant and the service is very enthusiastic.In the 218 standard room, the facilities and furniture styles in the room are relatively old -fashioned, but it is very clean. There is no problem with the mouse mentioned by the previous people.The only disadvantage is that the hotel's transportation is inconvenient. There is no taxi there to wait for customers there. Unless someone takes a taxi, you can only go out by yourself, and it takes about 10 minutes.On the first day, I went out of myself. The next day I went to the airport for half an hour to let the service desk call the car. As a result, I didn't come for half an hour. I almost missed the machine.Eating is also a problem of headache. No place to eat nearby.In addition, friends who go to Luzhou will go to Luzhou in the evening and be alone. It is best to take the airport bus to the city, which is safer than the taxi.There is no street light from the road out of the airport. If you encounter robbery and the like, it is really called every day.The airport took a taxi at the hotel for 21 yuan."
1,环境不错，房间设施挺好，很有档次，下次还会考虑入住,"The environment is good, the room facilities are very good, and there are very grades. I will consider staying next time"
1,"机场快线的K5直接到酒店门口,要了高层的客房,干净舒适,景色很美.住了两天,打扫房间很快.走出去到维港的星光大道20分钟,尖沙咀地铁8分钟,弥敦道5分钟.值得住.补充点评2008年7月20日：周边餐饮很多，挑选范围也广，最重要的是价格能承受。","The K5 of the Airport Express went directly to the entrance of the hotel, and asked the high -rise guest room, clean and comfortable, the scenery was beautiful. After staying for two days, the cleaning room was fast. Go out to the Avenue of Stars in Victoria Harbor for 20 minutes.Dun Road 5 minutes. It is worth living. Supplementary review July 20, 2008: There are many surrounding catering, and the selection range is wide. The most important thing is that the price can withstand."
1,地段不错，这次和老公6月6日入住，6月8日离开。checkin和checkout速度很快。刚开始给了我们10楼的房间，打开窗都是高楼，后来老公去前台公关了一下，换了17楼的大床房，打开窗能看到维港，真不错！没在酒店用过餐，因为附近的茶餐厅太多了。交通也方便，我们机场来回都坐的A21，每人33元，停要弥敦道，走走很快到酒店了。出行也方便，我们基本上都在尖沙嘴地铁站出发，后来找到近路，走到地铁站只需要5分钟的。下次去香港，会再考虑入住的。最后那天晚上机票回上海，中午要退房，就把行李寄在前台，也没问题，很好。就是房间小了点，哈哈。,"The location is good, this time I stayed in June 6 with my husband and left on June 8.Checkin and Checkout are fast.At the beginning, I gave us the room on the 10th floor. Opening the window was all high -rise buildings. Later, her husband went to the front desk to publicly talk about it. After changing the large bed room on the 17th floor, it was good to open the window to see Victoria Harbor!I haven't had a meal in the hotel, because there are too many tea restaurants nearby.The transportation is also convenient. A21 sitting back and forth in our airport, 33 yuan per person, stopped, and walked soon to the hotel.It is also convenient to travel. We basically set off at the Tsim Shazui Metro Station. Later, it was only 5 minutes to find the road.Next time I go to Hong Kong, I will consider staying again.On the last night, the air ticket returned to Shanghai, check out at noon, and send the luggage in the front desk. No problem, very good.The room is a bit smaller, haha."
1,处于厦门市区，离机场打的在约１６分钟，离ＳＭ商业中心也较近，有公交车到轮渡，去鼓浪屿很方便，位置是比较优越的．不足是房价与空间相比比较贵．,"In Xiamen City, it is about 16 minutes away from the airport, and it is closer to the SM commercial center. There are buses to ferry. It is convenient to go to Gulangyu. The location is superior.The shortcomings are that house prices are more expensive than space."
1,整体感觉还可以吧，价格方面在厦门还算可以，叫了餐服，服务态度还不错，房间感觉不是太好，用的洁具都很一般,"The overall feeling is OK. The price is okay in Xiamen. I called meals, and the service attitude is not bad. The room feels not very good."
1,服务不错，房间很大。之前其他评论提到的送机服务也是真的，因为有些事情离店时间比预约的晚了一些，司机态度仍然很好。最不满意的就是早餐很恶劣，吃的本来就少，像饮料什么的没了也没人要去补。习惯西式早餐的可能会发现没有东西可以吃，面包还是蛋糕的东西很硬，口感很糟糕，味道也差，严重破坏食欲。（中式早餐有一些，但没注意看，不评价）另外餐厅的卫生需要加强，地面的油感觉没有清除干净，踩上去黏黏的。放面包那边12月了还有苍蝇飞。总结一下就是向早餐无所谓的旅客推荐这个酒店，如果重视早餐，最好别住这里，住了两天食欲被败光了。,"The service is good and the room is large.The delivery service mentioned in other comments before is also true, because some things are later than the store time than the appointment, and the driver's attitude is still very good.The most dissatisfied is that the breakfast is very bad, and there are fewer foods. No one wants to make up for it.Those who are used to Western breakfast may find that there is nothing to eat. The bread is still very hard, the taste is bad, the taste is poor, and the appetite is severely damaged.(There are some Chinese breakfast, but I do n’t pay attention to it, do n’t evaluate it.) In addition, the hygiene of the restaurant needs to be strengthened.Put the bread in December and the flies fly.To sum up, it is to recommend this hotel to the travelers who do not care about breakfast. If you pay attention to breakfast, it is best not to live here. If you live for two days, your appetite will be defeated."
1,我是07年8月入住的这家酒店，环境和服务都不错，只是没有携程说的礼品果盘，虽然没什么大不了的，但是如果没有这项礼品还是不写的好。,"I am in this hotel where I stayed in August 2007. The environment and services are good, but I do n’t have a gift disk that Ctrip said. Although there is no big deal, it is not good if there is no gift."
1,酒店服务很好，环境幽雅，很地道，比当地同级的康年,"The hotel service is very good, the environment is elegant, authentic, and the Kangnian"
1,"酒店的硬件很好,服务人员也不错(如礼宾部)但还是有些不足.1.前台效率低.在办理入住时,共三位前台人员,两位在接电话,还有一位根本不会办理Checkin,还要等其他工作人员接好电话来帮他.有很多客人在前台等.2.入住当天晚上,在电梯里竟然有呕吐物,3.""阳光吧""没有客人要的饮料4.卫生间不够清洁如果没有以上不足,可以和上海,北京的五星媲美.","The hotel's hardware is very good, and the service staff is also good (such as the Royal Ben), but it is still a bit insufficient .1. When the front desk is low, the front desk is low. When checking in, there are three front desk staff, the two are answering the phone, and one will not be able to handle it at all.Checkin, we have to wait for other staff members to answer the phone to help him. There are many guests waiting at the front desk. 2. On the night of staying in the elevator, there was a vomit in the elevator. 3.If there is not enough cleaning, it can be comparable to the five stars in Shanghai and Beijing."
1,房子还凑合，但是硬件不行，不象4星酒店，服务还可以,"The house is still together, but the hardware is not good, not like a 4 -star hotel, the service is okay"
1,6月30到7月1号入住的.去美使馆办事很方便所以预定了.当天到达后酒店给的升级房间还好.说原来定的标准间看不到景色就是居民区.所以免费升级了.很好的房间.前台的CHECKINANDOUT慢.但其他还好.酒店设施也较时尚.老公很喜欢.门口也较方便逛街和散步吃东西.可以.火车站离的很近去机场回北京我们到300米处有一机场快线就是BUSTOAIRPORT20YUANPERPERSON.定点的.方便.可以推荐.,"It was convenient to stay in the US Embassy on June 30th to July 1st. So it is very convenient to work in the U.S. Embassy. So it ’s okay to rely on the hotel that the hotel given to the hotel on the same day. It’ s okay to say that the original standard room cannot see the scenery. It is a residential area.. Good room. Checkinandout at the front desk is slow. But other is good. Hotel facilities are also more fashionable. Husbands like it. The door is more convenient for shopping and walking.At 300 meters, a airport express line is Bustoairport20Yuanperperson. Set point. Convenience. It can be recommended. You can recommend it. You can recommend."
1,酒店所处位置跟交通都很方便。。而且服务态度很好，我在6月19号那天退房时，因为快递还没到。。我跟酒店方面帮我接收一下。。他们的态度很好。不过就是房间没有电蚊香，希望以后会有所改进~~宾馆反馈2008年7月9日：绝大部分时间，酒店客房是没有蚊子的，故没有在客房配备电蚊香。酒店管家部备有电蚊香供有需要的住客使用。夏季是广东省台风多发的季节，可能会有少数蚊子。,"The hotel's location and traffic are very convenient.EssenceAnd the service attitude is very good. When I checked out on June 19th, because the courier had not yet arrived.EssenceLet me receive it with the hotel.EssenceTheir attitude is very good.However, there is no electric mosquito coil in the room. I hope there will be improvement in the future ~~ Hotel feedback on July 9, 2008: Most of the time, there are no mosquitoes in hotel rooms, so there is no electric mosquito coils in the guest room.The hotel housekeeper has electric mosquito coils for residents needed.Summer is the season when the typhoon in Guangdong Province is often occurred, and there may be a few mosquitoes."
1,如果作为四星级的话，可以打70分吧。交通还是挺便利的。早餐也不错：）宾馆反馈2008年7月9日：欣喜地知会：2007年9月，广州天伦万怡大酒店顺利通过国家旅游局饭店星级评定委员会星级评定，荣膺五星级饭店。感谢阁下对我店早餐的赞赏，我们会保持好的出品，不断创新。,"If you are a four -star, you can score 70 points.Transportation is quite convenient.Breakfast is also good :) Hotel feedback on July 9, 2008: I am happy to know: September 2007, Guangzhou Tianlun Wanyi Hotel successfully passed the Star Star Assembly of the Star Evaluation Committee of the National Tourism Administration and was awarded a five -star hotel.Thanks to your appreciation of my shop breakfast, we will maintain good products and continue to innovate."
1,酒店内部装潢尚算不错，屋子很大，加带早餐。但是地下和一层的配套服务设施就不敢恭维了，天一擦黑大堂里基本上就已经空空如也。可能是地理位置的因素，周边也没有什么好去得地方，还要打车去几公里外的镇上。不过离浦东机场还算比较近，也可以在门口打到车，交通还是很方便的。不过按照酒店的地处位置和周边设施，房价还是偏贵,"The interior decoration of the hotel is still good, the room is large, and breakfast is added.However, the supporting service facilities on the ground and the first floor are dare not compliment. As soon as the dark lobby is wiped out, it is basically empty.It may be a factor in geographical location. There is no good place around the surroundings, and it has to take a taxi to a few kilometers away.However, it is relatively closer to Pudong Airport, and you can also get a car at the door. The transportation is still very convenient.However, according to the location and surrounding facilities of the hotel, house prices are still expensive"
1,房间：住得商务大床房，房间大小还行（一个人住不需要太大），可惜我住的那间电话竟然被放到写字桌上，床头没有，希望能调整一下，方便住客，其他方面，房间很干净，就是有蚊子呵呵环境：本来环境应该还可以，可惜我入住的时候，外边正在修建高架桥，比较吵，幸好本人睡得比较实在，晚上听不见：）服务：这一项很满意，一进门就有门童帮忙拎行李，一直送到电梯口，大堂入住和退房手续办理的很快，态度也很好，离开时赶飞机，提前和酒店订好了出租车，下楼时候车已经等候在那里了，很方便。晚上很晚打电话咨询，接线生的态度都不错其他：麒麟阁的中餐很好吃，早餐种类也很多，不错不错,"Room: Living in a large business bed room, the size of the room is okay (one person does not need to be too big), but unfortunately the phone I live in was put on the office desk, there is no bedside, I hope to adjust it to facilitate residents to facilitate residentsIn other aspects, the room is very clean, that is, there is a mosquito environment: Originally the environment should be okay, but when I stayed in, I was building a viaduct outside, and I was more noisy.Xiang was very satisfied. As soon as I entered the door, there was a child who helped to carry his luggage. He was sent to the elevator mouth. The lobby stays and checks out quickly, and his attitude is very good. When you leave, you can rush to the plane and bind a taxi with the hotel in advance.The car was waiting there when I went downstairs, which was very convenient.Call and consult at night, the attitude of the wiring students is good. Others: The Chinese food in Kirin Pavilion is delicious, and there are many types of breakfast."
1,在厦门岛内实地考察了很多家4星级标准酒店，认为这是性价比比较好的一家，位置还好，虽然设置不太新，但和其他几家挂牌4星且价格很贵的酒店相比也差不多。,"Many 4 -star standard hotels have been inspected on the field on the field. They believe that this is a better cost -effective one. The location is okay. Although the setting is not new, it is compared to several other hotels listed on 4 stars and expensive hotels.Also almost."
1,"管理有点混乱.明明房价已经包含两份早餐,可是西餐厅说""你的房间不包含早餐"";说了半天,总台还是打了一份""早餐147元""的单让我签字.","The management is a bit chaotic. Obviously, house prices have contained two breakfast, but the western restaurant said, ""Your room does not contain breakfast""; after a long time, the main station still made a ""breakfast 147 yuan"" order for me to sign."
1,"挺好的住的是公寓房,环境不错哦我很喜欢!下次来还打算住那里","I live in the apartment house, the environment is good, I like it! I still plan to live there next time"
1,逛街很方便，没有免费停车有点不方便，，，,"It is convenient to go shopping, and it is a bit inconvenient to stop without parking ,,,,"
1,酒店的服务人员服务周到，细致，给人一种宾至如归的感觉。,"The service staff of the hotel is thoughtful and meticulous, giving people a sense of guests."
1,酒店门脸有点小，你们倒是很大，房间还不错！就是房间的门已经有些下沉了，关门一定要用点力量，早餐差了点，反正不够4星早餐的水平，400多一天有点贵，要是能降到400以下比较合适！,"The door of the hotel is a bit small, you are very large, the room is not bad!That is, the door of the room is sinking, and the door must be used to close the door. The breakfast is a bit worse. Anyway, it is not enough for the level of breakfast for 400. It is a bit expensive for more than 400 a day. It is more appropriate to drop below 400!"
1,不知道是不是五一期间的缘故，感觉性价比不是很高。住的标间B好像是原来的餐厅包间改的，超级大，但是没有窗户，冷气不足，唯一的好处就是电视节目有很多频道。浴室小，水压也小，下水不够快。但是地理位置就没得嫌。,"I do n’t know if it is because of the period of May Day, and it is not very cost -effective.The standard room B of the living room seems to be changed by the original restaurant private room. It is super large, but there is no window and insufficient air -conditioning. The only advantage is that there are many channels for TV shows.The bathroom is small, the water pressure is small, and the water is not fast enough.But the geographical location is not suspected."
1,"五一节去的，住的是家庭房，别的倒还可以，不过不知道为什么房间里蚊子特别多，全家被蚊子咬的伤痕累累，亲手消灭了3只蚊子，然后仔细察看了一下墙壁和家具，有好多陈年的血迹，估计是前几批住客消灭蚊子后留下的。在杭州户外两天都没有被蚊子咬，在这家宾馆一晚上咬得倒是挺多的。补充点评2008年5月22日：总体来说去了两次杭州都是住这家宾馆的，感觉挺好的，第二次入住，还因为是老顾客送了一份水果，感觉很温馨。谢谢了！宾馆反馈2008年5月22日：尊敬的宾客,感谢您的点评.非常抱歉,近期酒店已安排专业的杀虫公司进行灭蝇防蚊工作,房务中心也准备了灭蚊片供客人使用,希望在您下次入住时能有更好的环境.期待着您的再次光临!","I went to the family room on May 1st. It was okay, but I do n’t know why there are a lot of mosquitoes in the room.Furniture has a lot of old blood stains. It is estimated that the first few groups of residents were left after the mosquito was eliminated.I did not be bitten by mosquitoes for two days in Hangzhou, and it was a lot bit bitter at this hotel all night.Supplementary comment on May 22, 2008: Generally speaking, I went to Hangzhou twice to live in this hotel. It feels good. I stayed in the second time. I also felt very warm because the old customers gave a fruit.Thank you!Hotel feedback on May 22, 2008: Dear guests, thank you for your comments. Sorry, the hotel has arranged a professional pesticide company to do flies and mosquitoes.I hope there will be a better environment when you stay in the next time. Looking forward to your visit again!"
1,"房间可以免费打长途很好.离西湖也不是很近.门口有直达公交去钱塘江和六和塔.还有一个小饭店,有杭州本地菜肴.宾馆反馈2008年5月7日：尊敬的宾客,感谢您的点评.酒店距离西湖200米,步行大约5分钟,欢迎您能再次光临!","The room can be free for free long distances. It is not very close to West Lake. There is a direct bus to Qiantang River and Liuhe Tower at the door. There is also a small restaurant with local dishes in Hangzhou. Hotel feedback on May 7, 2008: Dear guestsThank you for your review. The hotel is 200 meters away from West Lake and about 5 minutes walk. Welcome to visit again!"
1,房间里的设施有些老旧了，毛巾、浴巾、浴袍也都很旧。房间隔音很不好，本来以为在半上腰会很安静，结果却被下面卡拉OK还是夜总会的歌声吵得睡不着觉。唯一的优点是山上空气好。白天倒是很安静。,"The facilities in the room are somewhat old, and towels, bath towels, and bathrobes are also very old.The sound insulation of the room was very bad. I thought it would be quiet in the half -waist, but it was noisy to sleep by the karaoke of the karaoke below or the nightclub.The only advantage is that the air on the mountain is good.It is quiet during the day."
1,房间很好，我的客人很满意。电视、地毯、大床等等我的客人见了都感觉很好,"The room is very good, and my guests are very satisfied.TV, carpet, big bed, etc. My guests feel good when they meet"
1,酒店服务较好。入住后还给免费升了级，留下很好的印象。有机会还会去住，但价格应该再降下来一些。交通不是很方便。,"The hotel service is better.After check -in, it was also promoted for free, leaving a good impression.If you have a chance, you will live, but the price should be reduced.Transportation is not very convenient."
1,"该酒店在义乌来讲，交通环境出入方便，以前也入住过多次，酒店设施客房餐厅都比较满意。就是最近这次入住，在酒店客房叫了份西餐面，吃坏了肚子，连续上了五次卫生间，去街上药房买了肠炎药才止住，向服务员及类似领班性质的员工反应此情况后，对方也没个回音,（见对方没个回音，本人11月2日入住的，第二天就退房，住到伊美广场酒店去了）。不过抛开此事不谈话，该酒店应该是理想的入住对象。宾馆反馈2008年4月14日：给您带来的不愉快，我们表示诚挚的歉意，我们住店宾客的人身安全与食品安全是酒店关注的重点，如果有遇上什么事，请拨打大堂经理电话52，我们竭诚为您服务。","In terms of Yiwu, the hotel is convenient to enter and exit the traffic environment. It has been staying many times before, and the hotel facilities room and restaurants are relatively satisfied.That is, this time I stayed in this time. I called a western noodle in the hotel room. I had a bad stomach. I went to the bathroom for five consecutive times. I went to the pharmacy on the street to buy enteritis medicine before stopping.Later, the other party did not have an echo. (Seeing the other party did not have an echo, I stayed in November 2, and went out to check the next day and stayed at the Imei Plaza Hotel).But aside from this matter, the hotel should be an ideal target of check -in.Hotel feedback on April 14, 2008: The unpleasantness brought to you, we express our sincere apologies. The personal safety and food safety of our shop guests are the focus of the hotel's attention. If what happens, please call the lobby manager phone call.52, we will serve you wholeheartedly."
1,我是四月中旬入住的，是朋友介绍的，朋友说干净、没有骚扰且饭菜不错才预定的。我的评价是：服务态度很好，有好多老外都喜欢住在这里；饭菜不错，尤其是早餐还是很丰富的；干净整洁较新，卫浴设施还是不错的；缺点：房间较小，不过一个人住足够了！隔音十分不好，隔壁说话都听得见！值得一提的优点：有免费报纸、每晚有免费热牛奶，倍感温馨！还有就是我那几天身体不适，五层的服务员对我无微不至的关心我很感动，在这里谢谢你们！~总结：值得一去的性价比不错的酒店，推荐！,"I stayed in mid -April and introduced by a friend. My friend said that it was clean, no harassment, and good meals.My evaluation is: the service attitude is very good, and many foreigners like to live here; the meals are good, especially the breakfast is still very rich; clean, tidy and new, bathroom facilities are goodLive in enough!The sound insulation is very bad, and I can hear it next door!It is worth mentioning the advantages: there are free newspapers, free hot milk every night, and it feels warm!There is also my discomfort in those days. The five -layer waiter was moved by me. I was very moved by me. Thank you here!~ Summary: It is worth a good cost -effective hotel, recommended!"
1,非常不错的酒店，前台服务人员的态度也非常好，只是目前现在大堂在装修，找门都找了半天，这是小小的遗憾之处，其它都是非常不错的，值得一住！宾馆反馈2008年5月30日：谢谢您!!您的支持就是我们服务最好的鼓励!!,"The very good hotel, the attitude of the front desk service staff is also very good, but now the lobby is renovating and looking for the door for a long time. This is a small regret. Everything else is very good, it is worth living!Hotel feedback on May 30, 2008: Thank you !! Your support is the best encouragement for our service !!"
1,房间很大，有大窗户，而且靠近苏州河和外滩，到南京路也很近。主要住的很安静，不错。帮老板定的大床真的很大。就是地毯脏了点，早餐简单了，不值那个价钱，其他还好。下次来还会住的。补充点评2008年6月24日：北京东路似乎是买电线五金的，周围环境一般，自己有车去就好了。,"The room is large, with large windows, and near the Suzhou River and Bund, and it is very close to Nanjing Road.The main living is very quiet and good.The big bed set by the boss is really big.That is, the carpet is a bit dirty, the breakfast is simple, it is not worth the price, the others are okay.I will live next time.Supplementary comment on June 24, 2008: Beijing East Road seems to be buying wires hardware. The surrounding environment is average. You just have a car to go."
1,房间干净整洁，隔音还不错。感觉最好的是里面居然有几本不错的书可供阅读，很温馨。,"The room is clean and tidy, and the sound insulation is pretty good.The best thing is that there are a few good books in it to read, which is very warm."
1,"这个酒店是离科学城最近的一家商务酒店,大堂很气派,有直接从机场到达酒店的四号快线,几次入住过A楼的房间,每次都有常住常新的感觉,这次入住还知道他们又增设了电脑房,下次来要试试,房间的宽带上网速度很快,服务特别好,最方便的一点是他们有开通酒店到科学城的穿梭巴士.以后会常住这个酒店.","This hotel is a business hotel closest to Science City. The lobby is very elegant. There are No. 4 Express to the hotel directly from the airport. They stay in the room in Building A several times.I also know that they have added a computer room. I will try it next time. The broadband Internet speed of the room is fast and the service is particularly good. The most convenient point is that they have the shuttle bus to the hotel to the Science City. In the future, they will live in this hotel in the future."
1,已经是多次入住了，04房间的窗外景色还是那么的美，对面超市购物也很方便。,"It has been checked many times. The scenery outside the 04 room is still so beautiful, and shopping on the opposite side is also very convenient."
1,"刚开始订的是大床房,后来入住却发现酒店床单很脏,之后给的回复是床单弄错了(因为该酒店同时有公安系统招待所和酒店的产业,洗衣房弄错床单~~~~),很脏,所以不想住,服务员推荐说有豪华房,会好很多,最后选择了加钱住豪华房.~~~~酒店的硬件设施太老了,根本不像是4个星星的.唉","The big bed was originally booked, but then I checked in but found that the hotel sheets were dirty, and the reply to the sheets was wrong (because the hotel also had the industry's hospitality house and the hotel industry, the laundry room was wrong with sheets ~~~~), Very dirty, so I do n’t want to live. The waiter recommends that there are luxury rooms, which will be much better. Finally, I chose to stay with the luxury room. ~~~~ The hardware facilities of the hotel are too old, not like 4 stars at all.well"
1,这里虽然房间不大，但是充满温馨；虽然设施不很豪华，但是比较干净；虽然服务人员不多，但是比较细致。因此总体感觉还是不错的，对于离家在外的人，我认为需要更多一点这样的酒店，也希望携程网真的能够搭建这样的平台，让我们大家更加信任、更加依赖。宾馆反馈2008年5月6日：感谢您的点评，我们期待人生还有相逢时……,"Although the room is not large, it is full of warmth; although the facilities are not luxurious, they are relatively clean; although there are not many service staff, they are more detailed.Therefore, the overall feeling is still good. For those who are out of home, I think that more such hotels are needed, and I also hope that Ctrip.com can really build such a platform so that we all trust and depend on.Hotel feedback on May 6, 2008: Thank you for your comments. We look forward to the meeting in life ..."
1,也是冲着这楼下诸位旅友的评价去的，连住了几晚，感觉酒店的整个经营思想还是颇有独到之处的，整个运行结构颇似欧洲的中低端旅店，感觉务实简洁，亲切与温馨。房间隔音确实不行，尤其是经常听到服务员在走道里大声说话（这在欧洲旅店可是难以想象的事情），酒店后面有个楼盘的工地，白天略有噪音。醉月轩的菜的确味道一般，另希望进一步加强客房的打扫清洁工作，住了几天，身上有蚊虫咬痕，奇痒难忍至今未愈。希望你们做的更好所以说了那么多。,"It was also for the evaluation of travelers under the downstairs. After living in a few nights, I felt that the entire operating idea of the hotel was quite unique.Careful and warm.The sound insulation of the room is indeed not good, especially when the waiter often speaks in the aisle (this is an unimaginable thing in European hotels). There is a real estate site behind the hotel, and there is a little noise during the day.Drunk Yuexuan's dishes do have a general taste. I hope to further strengthen the cleaning and cleaning work of the guest room. After living for a few days, there are mosquito bite marks on the body.I hope you do so much so much."
1,离火车站比较近，打车的话起步费即可。但是吃饭比较不方便。补充点评2008年8月6日：定的商务大床房，在一楼，感觉暗暗的，窗户外貌似是楼下餐馆的某个储藏室，早上还有人会突然进去翻动东西,"It is closer to the railway station.But eating is inconvenient.Supplementary comment on August 6, 2008: The big business bed room, on the first floor, feels secret, the window seems to be a certain storage room in the restaurant downstairs."
1,"在市中心,离观前街很近,房间比较小,很干净,庭院式的,比较雅致,如果是去工业园区,不建议住这里.","In the city center, it is very close to Guanqian Street. The room is relatively small, clean, courtyard -style, and elegant. If you go to the industrial park, you are not recommended to live here."
1,"房间温馨小巧,酒店整体设计很有情调,离步行街很近,购物,吃饭都很方便.如果下次去苏州,还会选这个酒店.","The room is warm and small. The overall design of the hotel is very emotional. It is very close to the walking street. It is convenient to eat and eat. If you go to Suzhou next time, you will choose this hotel."
1,房间清理得不是狠及时，服务基本到位。周围环境稍有嘈杂，仍是闹中取静的地方。2015是我住的房间，如果下次去还要住这里，“好”就是一个字！！p.s.对面纽家巷左手第一家小店早餐大饼＋油条＋咸豆浆是人间盛宴，不可或缺,"The room was not cleaned in time, and the service was basically in place.The surrounding environment is slightly noisy, and it is still a place where you are in trouble.2015 is my room. If you still have to live here next time, ""good"" is a word!IntersectionP.S. The first small shop breakfast big cake + fritter + salted soy milk is a feast on earth, indispensable"
1,很不错的酒店，仿佛把苏州园林搬到了酒店，中式装修风格的房间倒是在别的酒店住过，但是拥有私密的小庭院的倒不多见。（每3个房间有一个小院子，虽然不大，倒也有苏州园林的感觉，算缩微版的吧）。另外，酒店里的工作人员很热情，知道我招蚊子，主动点了两个电蚊香，让我睡了个好觉。很高兴前台的那位先生。值得推荐的酒店，如果早餐再丰盛一点的话，就更好了。补充点评2008年7月4日：住的是携程上680元的房间，不觉得房间小。就在商业街附近（但是并不吵），逛街，吃饭都很方便。,"A very good hotel seems to move Suzhou gardens to the hotel. The Chinese -style decoration -style room has lived in other hotels, but it is rare to have a private courtyard.(There is a small yard in every 3 rooms. Although it is not large, it also feels like the Suzhou garden. Calculate the micro version).In addition, the staff in the hotel was very enthusiastic, knowing that I recruited mosquitoes and took the initiative to order two electric mosquito coils, which made me sleep well.I am very glad the gentleman on the front desk.It is worth recommending a recommended hotel.Supplementary comment on July 4, 2008: I lived in a room of 680 yuan in Ctrip, and I didn't feel that the room was small.Just near Commercial Street (but not noisy), shopping, eating is very convenient."
1,酒店离观全街很近，整体环境很有苏州小桥流水人家的风味，酒店内部环境幽静，园林式的花园就像住在古代大富人家的感觉，就是房间的面积很小，卫生间更小，床是大床但也比一般酒店的标准尺寸小一些。,The hotel is very close to the whole street. The overall environment has the flavor of the people in Suzhou Xiaoqiao. The internal environment of the hotel is quiet. The garden -style garden is like living in the ancient rich family.The bed is a large bed but smaller than the standard size of ordinary hotels.
1,的确是很好的酒店，环境很不错，其中，床更舒服。,"It is indeed a good hotel. The environment is very good. Among them, the bed is more comfortable."
1,很不错的酒店，强烈推荐。为什么要20个字,"Very good hotel, highly recommended.Why 20 words"
1,"没有想到开封这个地方.居然有服务这样好的宾馆。酒店人员的培训是很到位了。服务和我经历过的一些五星级酒店差不多了。果然是市委招待所的班子.缺点就是我们住的哪个房间,设施有点陈旧.交通很便利.从酒店步行5分钟就到了最繁华的开封的小吃一条街.","I did not expect this place in Kaifeng. There are such good hotels.The training of hotel staff is in place.The service is almost the same as some five -star hotels I have experienced.Sure enough, it is the team of the Municipal Party Committee. The disadvantage is which room we live in. The facilities are a bit old. The transportation is very convenient. 5 minutes from the hotel to the most prosperous Kaifeng snack street."
1,酒店不错，每次去中山出差都住的这家。如果已经成为酒店的会员，还会有一些小礼品，而且预授权也不过1倍。不错。早餐不错，花样很多，而且RoomService也很棒，订餐的时候接线人员也会很仔细的回答问题，还会针对我的口味推荐。,"The hotel is good, and every time I go to Zhongshan, I live in a business trip.If you have become a hotel member, there will be some small gifts, and pre -authorization will be only doubled.good.Breakfast is good, there are many tricks, and RoomService is also great. When ordering meals, the wiring staff will also answer questions very carefully, and it will also recommend it for my taste."
1,多次住此酒店，唯一这次是大地震后，感觉确实受到了地震影响。首先是房间内墙壁留下了裂缝，其次是电梯也有一部损坏。酒店的裙楼更像危楼。交通较方便，离火车站和汽车站很近，但是周围没有什么地方吃饭和购物。服务尚可。,"Having lived in this hotel many times, the only time this time was after the great earthquake, it really felt affected by the earthquake.The first is the cracks left in the wall of the room, and the second is that the elevator is also damaged.The podium of the hotel is more like a dangerous building.The transportation is more convenient, which is very close to the railway station and the bus station, but there is no place to eat or shop around.Service is acceptable."
1,住的的是两房一厅，卧室偏小，到卫生间要路过客厅和门厅，不太方便。服务尚可，早餐以欧式为主。入住时正好是端午节，还送了一盒粽子，蛮人性化的。总体来说还行。,"Living in two bedrooms and one living room, the bedroom is small. It is not convenient to pass the living room and the hall in the bathroom.The service is acceptable, and the breakfast is mainly European style.It was exactly the Dragon Boat Festival during the check -in, and a box of rice dumplings was also sent, and the barbaric was sexually sexually.Overall is OK."
1,酒店的环境服务能满足四星级标准，房间虽然比较小，但设施还不错，酒店内中餐厅菜的色香味还不错，可能是生意比较好的缘故，所以上菜速度有点慢，价钱和市中心的酒店差不多。服务上还是出现了一点问题，通过携程预订，入住首日酒店赠送每房VIP水果一份和价值50元的桑拿按摩券一张，入住期间酒店每天赠送每房价值288元中秋月饼礼盒一盒。水果是打电话到总台才送来的，桑拿按摩券和月饼礼盒连提也没有提，而且听口气好像总台并不知道要送什么东西。总体来说算是一间不错的酒店，下次还会考虑入住。补充点评2008年7月21日：酒店提供的早餐质量一般，而且品种不全，比如就缺少豆浆和豆腐花等中式的早餐品种，我观察下来吃早饭的老外并不多，应该可以增加一些中式的早餐品种。,"The environmental service of the hotel can meet the four -star standards. Although the room is relatively small, the facilities are not bad. The color and fragrance of the Chinese restaurants in the hotel may be good.The hotel in the center is almost the same.There is still a problem in the service. Through Ctrip's booking, the first day of the hotel will be given a VIP fruit per room and a sauna massage coupon worth 50 yuan. During the check -in, the hotel will give a box of 288 yuan Mid -Autumn Festival moon cake gift box per day.The fruit was delivered by the head office. The sauna massage coupon and the moon cake gift box did not even mention it, and it seemed that the head station did not know what the main station was going to give.Generally speaking, it is a good hotel, and you will consider check -in next time.Supplementary comment on July 21, 2008: The quality of breakfast provided by the hotel is average, and the variety is incomplete. For example, there is a lack of Chinese breakfast varieties such as soy milk and tofu flowers.Breakfast variety."
1,住的最贵的套房，除了房间大，其他看不出有最贵和5星之实质。按摩浴缸是坏的，水特别小，放缸水半个多钟头，热水最热也是温吞的。海景么不谈了，看黄浦江还更漂亮点。checkin排队有半个多钟头，居然说找不到我名字，看了半天说原来预定的是英文的，给身份证就找不到对应的中英名字了。没学过拼音的说。好的：服务态度很好，比市区的5星还好。大闸蟹很好，绝对正宗。害得我现在吃啥蟹都觉得不如此蟹美味,"The most expensive suite, except for the large room, can't see the most expensive and 5 -star essence.The massage bathtub is bad, the water is particularly small, and the water is more than half an hour. The hottest water is also warm.I do n’t talk about the sea view, and it ’s more beautiful to see the Huangpu River.Checkin lined up for more than half an hour. He actually said that he couldn't find my name. After reading it for a long time, it was scheduled to be in English, and the corresponding Chinese and English name could not be found for the ID card.I have never learned to Pinyin.Okay: The service attitude is very good, which is better than 5 stars in the urban area.Hairy crabs are good and absolutely authentic.Make me feel so delicious in what crabs I eat now"
1,题外话：来我们学校招聘的单位大都住在新悦或者东胜，很多同学都积极主动的去招聘人员居住的酒店争取工作机会。在新悦，工作人员在一楼电梯处围追堵截，坚决不允许学生乘坐电梯，于是大家都爬十几层的楼梯。在东胜，工作人员只是提醒大家不要拥挤，以免电梯罢工，大家都得爬楼梯。这大概就是4星和5星的差别吧！所以对新悦印象不好。此次入住感觉一般。补充点评2008年1月3日：补充：携程提供的价格并不是很有竞争力啊，只不过少了10元钱而已。,"Outside: Most units recruited from our school live in Xinyue or Dongsheng. Many students actively go to the recruiting hotels to live in hotels.At Xinyue, the staff chased the elevator on the first floor and resolutely did not allow students to take the elevator, so everyone climbed the stairs on the dozen floors.In Dongsheng, the staff just reminded everyone not to be crowded, so as not to strike the elevator. Everyone has to climb the stairs.This is probably the difference between 4 stars and 5 stars!So it is not impressed by Xinyue.It feels average this time.Supplementary comment on January 3, 2008: Supplement: The price provided by Ctrip is not very competitive, but it is only 10 yuan less."
1,没有写字台，电视剧旁边那点空间太小，明明房间里有空间，为什么不放张写字台？,"There is no writing desk, the space next to the TV series is too small, there is space in the room, why not let the writing table be released?"
1,地处闹市，办事方便。卫生条件好，人员服务好，性价比高！,"It is located in trouble, convenient to do things.Good sanitary conditions, good personnel services, high cost performance!"
1,之前通过携程订的无烟房，酒店都没法满足要求，所以每次都享受了免费升级，升级为套房。这次很顺利地订到要求的房间，但因为升级升惯了，呵呵，居然有点失落了。还是喜欢这里，喜欢这里的早餐。,"The cigaretteless rooms ordered by Ctrip before, the hotel could not meet the requirements, so I enjoyed the free upgrade every time and upgraded to a suite.This time I made a smooth booking room, but because of the upgrade, hehe, he was a bit lost.I still like it here and like the breakfast here."
1,太原市的酒店，这家算是很不错的。经常住，房间设施很满意，服务嘛，没什么太大感觉。以前都是直接入住，没有预订过。有一次去入住，前台接待小姐很热情地告诉了通过网络订房可以优惠的办法，并帮我这样做了。于是第二次去了，还想这样直接去前台通过网络公司订房，却被当班前台人员拒绝，在我说明了上次的事，他通过电脑查清我确实那天入住过后，还说“不可能不可能”。我认为你可以不为我办理，但不能说客人撒谎。后来得知那是大堂经理，搞得我很生气。。不过因为总去那里住，还是没有影响我后来还喜欢去万狮。,"The hotel in Taiyuan City is very good.Frequent living, the room facilities are very satisfactory, the service, there is nothing too much.I used to stay directly and had not reservations.Once I went to check in, the front desk receiving lady told the preferential method that can be preferentially reached through the Internet and helped me do it.So I went for the second time, and wanted to go to the front desk to book a house through the online company, but was rejected by the front desk staff of the class. I explained the last thing. He checked through the computer that I did not move in that day.impossible"".I think you can not do it for me, but you can't say that the guests lie.Later, I learned that it was the lobby manager, so I was very angry.EssenceHowever, because I always live there, I still did not affect me and I like to go to Wanli later."
1,"感觉该店的服务非常好,我凌晨三点从客户那儿回来打不到车请他们帮忙叫一辆出租车过来,结果他们不但叫了车过来,还有一位大堂副理也随车过来接我了(可能因为我是女生吧).总之我很满意.早餐还有我爱吃的黄桃.^_^","I feel that the service of the store is very good. I can't get a car from the customer from the customer at three in the morning and ask them to help them call a taxi.(Maybe because I am a girl). In short, I am very satisfied. Breakfast and the yellow peach I love to eat.^_^"
1,房间一般吧，卫生间的布局不太合理，有的房间面向商场，开窗空气不新鲜，早餐还可以，退房服务不错。,"The rooms are average. The layout of the bathroom is not reasonable. Some rooms are facing shopping malls. The windows are not fresh, breakfast is okay, and the check -up service is good."
1,"酒店在五一假期前后开始降价促销,感觉不错.","The hotel began to reduce prices before and after the May holiday, and it felt good."
1,环境还是挺不错的，工作人员也比较热情，晚上保安巡逻发现窗户没关还电话提醒我们，赞一个！早餐略显一般！酒店门口就是峨眉特色小吃！离旅游车站非常近，线路方便！房间设施虽达不到四星的标准，但在景区也还不错了。可以推荐！,"The environment is still very good, and the staff is also more enthusiastic. At night, the security patrol found that the window was not closed and the phone reminded us. Like one!Breakfast is slightly average!At the entrance of the hotel is Emei specialty snacks!It is very close to the tourist station, and the route is convenient!Although the room facilities cannot meet the standards of four -star, they are also good in the scenic area.It can be recommended!"
1,太子酒店，就是《酒店风云》的拍摄地啊！出差东莞就入住这儿，同事们很兴奋的要拍照纪念。而且，太子酒店是偶住了那么多酒店最喜欢的。酒店大堂就很气派，壁上有大型浮雕，装潢非常精致大气。房间环境和设施极其令人满意！光是打开房门插电一刻，就有阳台窗帘徐徐拉开，感觉在欢迎你一样。电视机边有给DVD挑，浴缸对面有屏幕可以洗澡时看，全程电子遥控板操纵这个那个不要太方便，日常用品也一样不缺还有意想不到的小贴心物品。赞！服务也很好，房价比较便宜。这个五星级实在值得！唯一的问题就是附近是比较荒凉下只角了，你想要Happy只有去酒店里的。补充点评2008年2月27日：住了一次园景房，却比较失望各类设备还不如原来的标间，“园景”只是能看到酒店内的花园而已还是原来的标间性价比更值,"Prince Edward Hotel is the shooting place of ""Hotel""!Staying in Dongguan, colleagues are very excited to take pictures to commemorate.Moreover, the Prince Hotel has occasionally lived in so many hotels.The hotel lobby is very elegant, with large reliefs on the wall, and the decoration is very delicate.The room environment and facilities are extremely satisfactory!Just when the door was opened for a moment, there was a balcony curtain open slowly, and it felt like you welcomed you.There is a DVD on the side of the TV. There is a screen opposite the bathtub to take a bath. It is not too convenient to manipulate this electronic remote control board throughout the process. There is no shortage of daily necessities and unexpected small intimate items.Thumbs up!The service is also very good, and house prices are cheaper.This five -star is really worth it!The only problem is that nearby is relatively desolate. You want Happy to go to the hotel.Supplementary comment on February 27, 2008: I lived in a garden view room, but it was more disappointed as the original standard room. ""Garden view"" can only see the garden in the hotel."
1,房间设施很不错，可是不知道为什么，房间内只有一个可以用的插座。比如，我用电脑的话，就不能给手机充电，很奇怪。你一定要和服务员拿排插才可以。,"The room facilities are very good, but I don't know why, there is only one socket in the room.For example, if I use a computer, I can't charge the phone, which is strange.You must take a row with the waiter."
1,自动窗帘，窗纱，遥控开关台，是太子酒店独特的地方。演艺馆很有特色，专业的歌舞杂技演员给人留下非常深刻的印象。早餐也非常丰富，不过不够精致，有点大锅饭的感觉。另外，园景房的窗外景色也非常不错，有超大的泳池，园林，还有儿童乐园，我朋友还曾经跑去园子里摘过荔枝~,"Automatic curtains, window screens, remote control switching tables are unique places for Prince Edward Hotel.The entertainment hall is very distinctive, and professional song and dance acrobatics are very impressed by people.Breakfast is also very rich, but it is not exquisite enough, a bit of a big pot of rice.In addition, the scenery outside the garden view room is also very good. There are large swimming pools, gardens, and children's parks. My friend once ran to the garden to pick litchi ~"
1,"本人住过国内外酒店过百家,在珠海都住过好几家,我们4大2小于国庆节入住这家挂牌四星公寓酒店的豪华三人套,现和大家分享一下：好的方面:1.酒店是由几座商品房改造的,外部环境不错,绿树成荫,房间面积大(2房一厅);2.酒店的康乐活动有保龄球,高尔夫球练习场,网球,游泳,等等,(须另外收费);3.酒店的停车方便,而且不收费;4.客房内的食品价格不高，5.服务态度好,服务员会带客人上到房间,并介绍房间设施,入住和退房较快.不好的方面:1.设施不豪华,只能算舒适,客房内的厨房如要使用另加30元一天,2.客房内毛巾清洁的不够专业,床和床上用品质量普通，3.客房内的保养做的不足,如睡房内的床头灯不能调节光度,4.如有小孩的,睡房内的窗户打开后一定要小心,因为窗户距床很近,不要让小孩子一个人在床上玩(酒店方面应该要有提示,或将窗户做成只能打开15-20厘米).补充点评2008年1月11日：总的来说,这个酒店的硬件最多3星水平;最大的好处是周边环境比较好.","I have lived in more than a hundred hotels at home and abroad, and have lived in Zhuhai. We 4 major 2 luxury three people who stayed in this list of four -star apartment hotels in the National Day. Now I will share with you: Okay: 1. The hotel is transformed from several commercial houses. The external environment is good, the green trees are lined, and the room area is large (2 rooms and one living room);(It must be charged separately); 3. The hotel's parking is convenient and does not charge; 4. The price of food in the room is not high, 5. The service attitude is good. The waiter will bring the guests to the room and introduce the room facilitiesFast. Instead of good aspects: 1. The facilities are not luxurious and can only be considered comfortable. If the kitchen in the guest room is used, add 30 yuan a day. 2. The towels in the guest room are not clean enough. The quality of beds and bedding is ordinary. 3. Insufficient maintenance in the guest room, such as the bedside lamp in the bedroom cannot regulate the light, 4. If there is a child, the windows in the bedroom must be careful when the windows are close to the bed.A person is playing in bed (there should be a prompt in the hotel, or the window can only be opened for only 15-20 cm). Supplementary reviews January 11, 2008: In general, the hardware of this hotel is up to 3 stars;The biggest advantage is that the surrounding environment is better."
1,"优点:房间很大,前台说该酒店是以前的南油员工宿舍改建的,感觉就像是度假村.缺点:1.酒店周围没有商家,最好是事先买好东西(水/食品)再前往酒店.2.酒店应该要与泳池/保龄球/高尔夫/健身房/网球….等休闲设施签协议让住客可以免费使用.补充点评2007年12月29日：谢谢酒店回复我的评价.我记得当时在前台结帐时,服务员跟我提到酒店特别重视房客的反馈,由此看来所言不假!有如此用心的酒店,相信生意必然昌隆.宾馆反馈2007年9月7日：向您致以诚挚的歉意没能及时准确让您了解以下信息，澄清一下，1、珠海南油大酒店的前身是珠海市政府投入南海石油开发给部分外国专家的高级公寓，按照当时国际化的理念进行设计规划，直至南海石油珠海片开发项目搁置，后来平衡多方利益，改建为渡假村酒店至今。2、酒店的商场营业时间为8：00AM―21：00PM，地点在酒店大堂后盏记食府2楼，酒店咖啡厅亦营业至24：00，为住客提供便利服务，另本月新开张了一家好思家零食店。3、酒店的泳池/保龄球/高尔夫/健身房/网球….等休闲设施酒店住客均可享受优惠折扣。","Advantages: The room is very large. The front desk said that the hotel was converted from the previous Nander employee dormitory. It feels like a resort. Disadvantages: 1. There are no merchants around the hotel. It is best to buy good things (water/food) in advance and then go to the hotel.2. Hotels should sign with the swimming pool/bowling/golf/gym/tennis .... Signing agreement for leisure facilities to allow guests to use it for free. Supplementary comment on December 29, 2007: Thank you hotels for replying to my evaluation. I remember at the front desk at that time at the front deskDuring the checkout, the waiter mentioned to me that the hotel attaches great importance to the feedback of the tenant. It seems that it is not false! There is such an attentive hotel, I believe that the business must be Changlong. Hotel feedback on September 7, 2007: Severe you sincerelyThe apologies cannot be accurately and accurately let you understand the following information. Clarify it. 1. The predecessor of the Zhuhai Handan Hotel is the high -end apartment developed by the Zhuhai City Government in Nanhai Petroleum Development to some foreign experts.Until the Nanhai Petroleum Zhuhai Film Development Project was put on hold, and later balanced the interests of various parties and was converted into the Resort Hotel.2. The hotel's shopping mall business hours are 8:00 AM -21:00pm. The location is on the second floor of the hotel's house behind the lobby of the hotel.A good family snack shop.3. The hotel's swimming pool/bowling/golf/gym/tennis ... and other casual facilities hotel guests can enjoy discounts."
1,"酒店位置交通方便,但是临街噪音较明显,窗户隔音效果不如人意,浴室中配备的冲浪浴缸无法使用,房间中的桑拿房也无法使用,酒店自助早餐的品种和口味也一般,较为遗憾","The location of the hotel is convenient, but the noise of the street is more obvious. The sound insulation effect of the windows is not satisfactory. The surfing bathtubs equipped in the bathroom cannot be used. The sauna in the room cannot be used."
1,不错，门口、大堂成天美女如云///////////////////,"Yes, the beauty at the door and the lobby is like a cloud ///////////////////"
1,酒店的房间不错，非常宽敞，背靠音乐学院，很安静，经常有美女出入。缺点是此楼是商务用房，很多小公司在里头，还住了不少学生，高峰期间电梯有点繁忙，半天不到，晚上有骚扰电话，网速比较慢。周围吃饭，消费，酒吧等都很方便。,"The hotel's room is good, very spacious, and the back of the music college is very quiet and often has beautiful women in and out.The disadvantage is that this building is a business house. Many small companies have lived in it. During the peak, the elevator was a bit busy. It was less than half a day. There were harassment calls at night. The network speed was slow.Eating around, consumption, bars, etc. are very convenient."
1,还是茂名最好的酒店。现在拆了浴盆，帘子长度不够，水溅出来很多，地面很滑。,"It's still the best hotel in Maoming.Now I disassembled the bathtub, the curtain length was not enough, the water splashed a lot, and the ground was slippery."
1,1、前台服务不好，结账时没有人等都会很慢，而且我住了5天退房要求延长到14：00都不行，最多13：00，这个是在别的酒店从未遇到过的。2、3楼和4楼的茶餐厅不错。3、服务员服务意识有待提高，见面不微笑，在洗手间遇到也不会让客人先洗手，4、网速较慢，,"1. The front desk service is not good, and no one will wait at the checkout that it will be very slow, and I live in 5 days to retire the house and ask for extension to 14:00.EssenceThe tea restaurant on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th floor is good.3. The awareness of the waiter's service needs to be improved. Do not smile when you meet. If you meet in the bathroom, you will not let the guests wash their hands first. 4. The speed of the internet is slow."
1,"确实是茂名最好的酒店,房间很大,装修也很新,酒店所处位置的风景也非常好.窗户的隔音很好,即使是靠马路的房间晚上睡觉也很安静.早餐很丰富.",It is indeed the best hotel in Maoming. The room is very large and the decoration is very new. The scene in the hotel is also very good. The sound insulation of the window is very good. Even the room on the road is very quiet at night. The breakfast is rich.
1,相当不错宽带速度很不错。周边环境也可以个人比较喜欢,The broadband speed is very good.The surrounding environment can also personally like
1,"服务很好,窗在路边也不会吵,很舒服.只是卫生间的淋浴用的不太习惯~","The service is very good, the window is not noisy on the road, it is very comfortable. It's just that the shower in the bathroom is not used to it ~"
1,去年11月去北京，前门店没房间了，订了菜市口，很不错，干净，服务态度很好，有问必答，餐厅总体来说还可以，楼下的涮肉很不错。,"I went to Beijing in November last year. There was no room in the former store. I booked a vegetable market. It was very good, clean, and good service attitude. There was a question of answering questions. The restaurant was generally okay."
1,海上花园酒店紧邻菽庄花园，离商业街龙头路也不远，位置得天独厚。傍晚上岛，乘坐酒店免费接送游客的电瓶车，我们沿着环岛路绕行鼓浪屿一周。迎着海风，岛上的景致惊鸿一瞥，锦缎似的蓝色海面好似一个温柔的怀抱，令夕阳一点一点地沉睡下去…海上花园酒店的1201标间正对一宽大的平台，推门即可见美丽的院景和无边的海景。每晚，在鼓浪屿音乐厅欣赏完免费的音乐演出，从月色如水的寂静小巷回到灯火阑珊的海上花园酒店，温暖闲逸的度假生活令人满心欢喜。,"The Sea Garden Hotel is close to the Langzhuang Garden, not far from the leading road of commercial street, and the location is unique.In the evening, the island, take the battery car for free tourists by the hotel, we wrap around Gulangyu along the island road for a week.Facing the sea breeze, the scenery on the island was shocked, and the brocade -like blue sea surface seemed to be a gentle embrace, which made the sunset sleeping little by little ...You can see the beautiful courtyard scenery and boundless sea view.Every night, I will enjoy free music performances at Gulangyu Concert Hall. From the silent alley of the moonlight as water, I return to the sea garden hotel with a lit. The warm and leisure vacation life is full of joy."
1,酒店环境不错，自助早餐品种丰富，值得一去。,"The hotel environment is good, the buffet breakfast variety is rich, it is worth a go."
1,"环境非常好的酒店,由于是工作日去的关系,人很少,往山上走10分钟左右就是一个水库,非常幽静.酒店的房间很大,住的是标C房,晚上睡觉是关窗开空调的,也没觉得怎么吵.温泉没去,如果住店的话温泉60元/人.房间里也是温泉水,用木桶泡,酒店提供一次性塑料袋,很周到.在酒店吃了一顿晚饭,4个人300多,感觉和上海的价格差不多.","Hotels with very good environment, because it is a working day, there are very few people. It is a reservoir to walk on the mountain for about 10 minutes. It is very quiet. The hotel's room is very large.The air conditioner did not feel any noisy. The hot spring didn't go. If the shop stayed at the hot spring 60 yuan/person. The room was also hot spring water, soaked in wooden barrels, the hotel provided disposable plastic bags, very thoughtful. I ate a meal in the hotel.Dinner, more than 300 people, it feels similar to the price of Shanghai."
1,"住标c,不要住在靠康乐中心那头,泵房太吵了,估计专留给携程的,入住时说是2楼都有噪音,观察下来,根本不是,就2楼面对泵房的几间才吵.","Live in the bid C, do not live on the other side of the Kangle Center, the pump room is too noisy. It is estimated that it is left to Ctrip. When you stay in, you have noise on the second floor. Observe it.Several noisy."
1,"标房房间挺大的,外面的环境一般.我订时要求环球好点不过外面也没什么.估计是农村,农村里就是空气好,价格有点偏高.服务员的态度是非常不错,不过餐厅的上菜速度太慢.催了好几次才上菜.地方比较偏.四星级酒店远不如其他地方的四星级的各项服务.","The benchmark room is quite large, and the outside environment is average. I ask for a time to make a better time. But there is nothing outside. It is estimated that it is rural. The rural areas are good. The price is a bit high.The speed of the dishes is too slow. It was urged several times to serve. The place is more partial. Four -star hotels are far less than four -star services in other places."
1,1、酒店还算可以，设施有点旧，四星级勉强2、地处陈家坪，没有大型商场超市，背后有个美食街。送餐服务只有西餐厅的套餐，不过价格还可以，另有赠送水果小盘，不错（因为周围买不到水果）。3、开通电话要10元/日（包打市内、长途），这个看不懂，要是碰上长途电话煲，会怎样？上网是免费，网速可以。,"1. The hotel is okay. The facilities are a bit old. The four -star is barely 2. It is located in Chenjiaping. There is no large shopping mall supermarket. There is a food street behind it.The food delivery service is only a package of Western restaurants, but the price is okay, and there are small fruits, which is good (because you can't buy fruits around).3. The phone is 10 yuan/day (including the market, long -distance). I ca n’t understand this. What would happen if you encountered a long -distance telephone pot?The Internet is free, the network speed is okay."
1,房间挺好，但是内部的电视太陈旧，紧靠马路非常吵人，玻璃也不是双层的，但是吃饭很方便，就在背后有一条街都是,"The room is very good, but the internal TV is too old, and the road is very noisy. The glass is not a double -layer, but it is very convenient to eat. There is a street behind it."
1,去成都住的较多的酒店之一。行政房不错。普通房间里的设施比较老旧了。出门打车基本要等，现在修地铁，门口改了单行道就更不方便了。,One of the hotels where there are more in Chengdu.The administrative room is good.The facilities in ordinary rooms are older.It is even more inconvenient to go out to take a taxi. Now it is even more inconvenient to change the one -way road at the door.
1,"酒店很干净\漂亮.最特别的是赠送的洁具还有小木梳什么的,很是贴心.最烦的是每次到深圳出差,下了飞机,那些个出租车司机都会大肆宰人,就十几分种的车程要价就是二百多块,直接不打票,真叫人吃不消.见多了,也就知道了,是这边的风气,估计是改不了了.","The hotel is very clean \ beautiful. The most special is the gift of the gift and the small wooden comb. It is very intimate. The most annoying thing is that every time you go to Shenzhen on a business trip, when you get off the plane, those taxis drivers will be slaughtered.The asking price of a few types of drive is more than two hundred yuan, and it is not unable to eat it. If you see too much, you know, it is the atmosphere here, it is estimated that it can't be changed."
1,房间很干净，所有用具设施都比较新，价格也很合理，是到宝安工作的首选．美中不足，打车很困难，应该是酒店的位置不理想的缘故,"The room is very clean, all the equipment and facilities are relatively new, and the price is reasonable. It is the first choice to work in Baoan.Insufficient in the United States and China, it is difficult to take a taxi. It should be because the location of the hotel is not ideal."
1,"住了好多次宝晖````还好,就是外面的烧烤档贵的离谱````","I have lived many times Baohui `` `Fortunately, the outrageous is expensive outside the grill` `` ``"
1,房间的布局有点奇怪，空调的调节装置居然在minibar上面。第一晚没有找到，所以冻了一宿。入住的时候，26层正在装修，油漆味比较浓。大堂也有相似的味道，还好旁边的中餐厅没有油漆味。28层的游泳池和风景不错，正对着创业立交。第一晚有欢迎水果，不过是夜里十一点半才打电话过来问是否方便送进来，所以觉得奇怪。是深圳的关外，不过打车还比较方便。,"The layout of the room is a bit strange, and the adjustment device of the air conditioner is actually above minibar.I didn't find it on the first night, so I froze.When checking in, the 26th floor is decorated, and the paint taste is relatively strong.The lobby also has a similar taste. Fortunately, the Chinese restaurant next to it has no paint.The 28th floor swimming pool and scenery are good, facing the entrepreneurial interchange.On the first night, there was a welcome fruit, but it was only at 11:30 at night to ask if it was convenient for sending in, so it was strange.It is outside Shenzhen, but it is more convenient to take a taxi."
1,虽然周围环境差了一些，但是酒店大堂气派，房间宽敞，设备新，服务到位，总体来说在酒店内确实是五星的标准，考虑到周边环境，携程应当在费用上再争取一下。补充点评2006年8月7日：由于是通过携程定的房间，所以宽带免费，但是没人提醒，所以用手机上网卡磨了半天，这一点比较郁闷。,"Although the surrounding environment is a bit worse, the hotel lobby is spacious, the rooms are spacious, the equipment is new, and the service is in place. Generally speaking, it is indeed a five -star standard in the hotel. Considering the surrounding environment, Ctrip should strive for the cost.Supplementary comment on August 7, 2006: Because it is freely set by Ctrip, the broadband is free, but no one reminds it, so it has been grinded with a mobile Internet card for a long time, which is more depressed."
1,酒店的房间很好，景色很不错。酒店的早餐不好，管理也不太专业。最主要是从酒店到外面的交通，很不方便。外面的出租车漫天要价，随便拒载。如果自己没有车，最好不要住在这里。,"The hotel's room is very good and the scenery is very good.The hotel's breakfast is not good and management is not very professional.The main is the transportation from the hotel to the outside, which is very inconvenient.The taxi outside the car is asking for the price, and casually refuses to load.If you have no car, it is best not to live here."
1,总体不错，窗外就是江，周围吃的也很多。（乐山人民有些不友好，当心敲诈，吃东西最好多走几家问问价。）要的是180的标间，房间空间很大，虽然有些成就，不过也算对得起他的价格了，早餐没吃，送了两瓶小矿泉水，不够喝，建议换小桶装的。,"Overall is good, Jiang Jiang is outside the window, and you eat a lot around.(The people of Leshan are a bit unfriendly, blackmail, and it is best to take a few more asks for eating.) The 180 standard room is very large. Although some achievements are achieved, it is worthy of his price. BreakfastI did n’t eat it, I gave two bottles of small mineral water. It was not enough to drink. It is recommended to change the small barrel."
1,"本人是和老公订的蜜月套餐的,属于渡假类产品．整个酒店很大气，本人感觉西餐也不贵呀，情侣套餐好多东东的哦，才一百五十八元一份呀，房间很有气氛，值得去试试的哦，我们是下午到达的，就去游泳，再去吃饭，在西餐厅里听歌，感觉很浪漫哦。然后去按摩，一系列都在套餐里了，感觉很不错哦。就是用餐的迎宾态度不太好，其他都很满意了","I booked a honeymoon package with my husband and belongs to a holiday product.The whole hotel is very atmospheric, and I feel that Western food is not expensive. There are a lot of stuff for couples. It is only 158 yuan a copy. The room is very atmospheric and it is worth trying. We arrived in the afternoon.Go swimming, go to dinner, and listen to songs in the western restaurant. It feels very romantic.Then go to the massage, a series is in the set meal, it feels very good.That is, the welcoming attitude of the meal is not very good, and the others are very satisfied"
1,住的副楼，未评星的，设施就很一般了，肯定是没有主楼好的。电视可收看的频道也不好。早餐要到主楼那边去吃，比较丰富，就早餐不错。,"The auxiliary building, without the star, the facilities are very general, there must be no main building.The channel for TV can be watched is not good.Breakfast is to eat at the main building. It is rich and breakfast is good."
1,"1.地理位置不错2.周围设施商圈热闹方便3.酒店比较旧,应该改造了4.服务态度不错",1. Good geographical location 2. The surrounding facility business district is lively and convenient. 3. The hotel is relatively old and should be transformed. 4. The service attitude is good
1,这次住的附楼（未挂星），硬件设施比较陈旧，空调也不太好，我还因此换了回房间．二楼还有很多蚊子．不过服务,"The attached building (unaware of the star) this time, the hardware facilities are relatively old, and the air conditioner is not good. I also changed back to the room.There are many mosquitoes on the second floor.Service"
1,"我住的是大床房，房间很大，还有一个蛮舒服的沙发。但宾馆设施比较陈旧,木头上的油漆都剥落了，服务比较好。同意前面的朋友评价的，“至于说的在房间能看到大佛,呵呵,用天文望远镜也许能行!”","I live in a large bed room, the room is large, and there is a pretty comfortable sofa.However, the hotel facilities are relatively old, and the paint on the wood is peeled off, and the service is better.Agree with the evaluation of the friends in front, ""As for what you can see the big Buddha in the room, huh, you may be able to go with an astronomical telescope!"""
1,在宜昌应该是排名前三位的酒店了，希望能继续得到保持，应该会成为宜昌的首选,"In Yiyi, it should be the top three hotels. I hope to continue to be maintained. It should become the first choice of Yichang."
1,环境优美，设施齐全，服务周到，房间舒适。,"The environment is beautiful, the facilities are complete, the service is available, and the room is comfortable."
1,此次入住的是豪华标准间，房间号A区1311。房间干净、设备良好。遗憾之处：距离古镇约有20分钟的路程，晚上KTV声音较吵，早餐品种很少、口味欠佳。补充点评2007年9月11日：酒店距离古镇很远，出行一次到古镇，还是坐人力车比较方便,"This time I stayed in the luxury standard room, the room number A 1311.The room is clean and the equipment is good.Unfortunately: There is about 20 minutes from the ancient town. The KTV sound is more noisy at night. The breakfast varieties are very small and the taste is not good.Supplementary comment on September 11, 2007: The hotel is far away from the ancient town. It is more convenient to travel to the ancient town once."
1,10月17日入住，总体感觉可以，离景区较远，正好可以从西塘政治中心一路走到老镇，感受岁月变化，也算与时俱进。如果热，服务员可以提供电扇，还是美的牌哦！,"Checking in on October 17, the overall feeling is okay. It is far from the scenic area. It can just go from Xitang Political Center to the old town to feel the changes in the years and keep pace with the times.If it is hot, the waiter can provide a fan, or a beautiful card!"
1,房间还算整齐宽敞，我住的是标准间大床房，只是浴室的淋浴笼头不太好，出水不均匀，洗澡不舒服。服务还不错，到酒店是早上11点，让我提前入住，而且结账速度也比较快，不耽误时间。酒店靠近13号地铁，还算方便的。,"The room was neat and spacious. I lived in a standard room in the standard room, but the shower in the bathroom was not very good. The water was uneven and the bath was uncomfortable.The service is not bad. It was 11 am in the hotel. Let me stay in advance, and the checkout speed is relatively fast without delaying time.The hotel is close to the 13th subway, which is quite convenient."
1,物有所值，环境挺好的。下次去浦东机场可以考虑入住！,"It is worthwhile and the environment is very good.Next time you go to Pudong Airport, you can consider check -in!"
1,天黑时太难找了，也没有亮灯的指示牌，打车兜了一圈才找到，在新国际展览中心里面那条路的最里面……服务还行，就是太难找了。,"It was too difficult to find when it was dark, and there was no sign of the lighting. After taking a ride, I found it. The innermost road in the new international exhibition center ... The service is okay, but it is too difficult to find."
1,因为参展，就选择了这酒店。酒店在新国际展览馆内，这是最大的优势。摆展的时候随时可以走回酒店的，免去了交通麻烦。但如果是大型展览会酒店的价格也是较高的，平时360的房间遇到展会时竟涨到458，说实话，在龙阳路这种房间458绝对不值的，就冲方便而来的了。还有就是早餐，要28一份，真不知道有啥好吃的，而且9点以后估计连煎蛋都没有了。最让人觉得不爽的就上网要收钱，还60元一天！住这里的人基本都是来参展的商务出差的，10有8个都带有笔记本办公的，这不等于变相多收60元房费吗？还有就是那个酒店菜馆，东西一般的很，但价格倒不便宜，清炒时蔬都要18块！总体来说房间还算干净卫生的，但就不值这个价吧。如果摆展入住的话，因为实在是比邻方便，也别计较那么多了，还是值得推荐的,"Because of the exhibition, I chose this hotel.The hotel is the biggest advantage in the New International Exhibition Hall.When you are showing, you can go back to the hotel at any time, eliminating traffic troubles.However, if the price of a large exhibition hotel is also high, the 360 rooms usually rose to 458 when the exhibition encountered the exhibition. To be honest, the 458 room like Longyang Road is absolutely not worth it, it will come and conveniently come.EssenceThere is also breakfast. It takes 28 copies. I really do n’t know what is delicious, and it is estimated that there is no fried egg after 9 o'clock.The most uncomfortable one is to collect the money online, it is 60 yuan a day!People who live here are basically business trips to participate in the exhibitors. 10 of 10 have laptop office. Isn't this the same that they charge 60 yuan more in disguise?There is also that hotel restaurant. It is very general, but the price is not cheap. When stir -fry, the vegetables are 18 yuan!In general, the room is still clean and hygienic, but it is not worth the price.If you are showing up, because it is really convenient to be adjacent, don't care so much, it is worth recommending"
1,"总体感觉很不错,对得起这个价格.就是隔间太差,晚上旁边房间看电视声音听得很清楚.其它什么都好.","The overall feels very good, it is worthy of this price. That is, the compartment is too bad. The sound of watching the TV next to the room at night can be heard very clearly. Everything else is good."
1,还不错，来北京的首选．就是餐厅太贵．．．．．．,"Not bad, the first choice to come to Beijing.It is the restaurant that is too expensive..........."
1,"整体不错,房间大,干净.服务也挺好的.酒店离市中心,海边都挺近.前台叫车也很即时.就是不知为何,回酒店时候,很多出租司机没听过这个酒店....晕....因为是2楼,有蚊子..不过蚊香就在触手可及的地方,还好~","The overall is good, the room is large, clean. The service is also very good. The hotel is very close to the city center. The front desk is very immediate. I do n’t know why, when I return to the hotel, many rental drivers have never heard of this hotel .... Halo ... because it is on the second floor, there are mosquitoes .. But mosquito coils are at the place where the tentacles can be, fortunately ~"
1,总体感觉不错，不过每间房只含一份早餐不太合适。另外，自助早餐的价格偏高。,"Overall feels good, but it is not suitable for each room to contain only one breakfast.In addition, the price of buffet breakfast is high."
1,环境比较旧，但是床单、毛巾都比较干净，前台服务态度良好。,"The environment is relatively old, but the sheets and towels are relatively clean, and the front desk service attitude is good."
1,服务到位，早餐很好，尤其是checkin时小姐的热毛巾很温馨。就是商务中心的服务价格太高了,"The service is in place, and the breakfast is very good, especially when Miss's hot towels are very warm.The service price of the business center is too high"
1,"房间挺宽敞,也干净.床上用品的质量都不错,让人觉得服务挺用心的.门口的服务生态度挺好的,晚上我们11点在店外的停车点倒车,门口的服务生主动迅速跑上来帮忙看着.此行因为还在另二家宾馆各住一夜,比较下来海外海提供的拖鞋质量最不好了(看来是为了省成本).第二天一早开车送父母去灵隐,很方便.下次来杭州还会考虑住的.","The room is very spacious and clean. The quality of the bedding is good, which makes people feel that the service is very intentional. The service attitude of the service at the door is very good. At 11 o'clock in the evening, we will reverse at the parking point outside the store at 11 o'clock.Come up and help watch. Because this trip is still living in the other two hotels one night, the quality of slippers provided by the overseas Sea is the least bad (it seems to save the cost). I drove to my parents to Lingyin the next morning.It is very convenient. Next time I come to Hangzhou, I will consider living."
1,"还不错,比较适合自驾的经济适用的星级酒店.酒店设施3_;周边环境3;服务3+;设施偏老,而且还省了不少东西,美其名环保,呵呵,还能接受.周边交通不错,面山背小区,景观不错,去景点也不远,适合自驾.服务比较用心,无论是停车场帮看倒车,房间的免费饮用水,假日不涨价...基本看出管理层满重服务的.提一下三人房,只比双人的贵20元,要知道早餐券就要28元,合算的,房间很大,床也不小,适合一家三口.提一下早餐,品种不少,东西比较普通,不值28元.","It's not bad. The economically suitable star hotel. Hotel facilities 3_; peripheral environment 3; service 3+; facilities are old, and it also saves a lot of things.The traffic is good, the back of the mountain back, the landscape is good, and the attractions are not far away. It is suitable for self -driving. The service is more attentive. Whether it is the parking lot to help the car, the free drinking water in the room, the price of the room will not increase.Those who are full of heavy service. When you mention the three -person room, it is only 20 yuan more expensive than the two. You must know that the breakfast voucher is 28 yuan. It is cost -effective. The room is large and the bed is not small. It is suitable for a family of three.Few, things are relatively ordinary, not worth 28 yuan."
1,酒店基本符合要求，早餐不错，挺丰富的。去灵隐寺非常方便。免费停车。,The hotel basically meets the requirements. Breakfast is good and rich.It is very convenient to go to Lingyin Temple.Free parking.
1,"我的朋友来北京多数住这里.感觉套房向南方向的还不错,其他朝向的很不好,价格应降低一个档次.特别是两头的,特别不好.我的朋友很不满意.另外,停车费极贵,吃一次饭就得10多元.应该住宿的停车免费!!!","Most of my friends come to Beijing to live here. I feel that the suite is not bad in the southward direction. Other orientation is very bad. The price should be reduced by one grade. Especially on both ends, it is particularly not good. My friend is very dissatisfied.It is very expensive, and it takes more than 10 yuan for a meal. The parking that should be accommodation is free !!!"
1,房间装修后第一次入住，感觉还可以；比较干净。服务也还不错，只是周围坐车不是很方便。,"The first time I stayed in the room, I felt okay; it was cleaner.The service is not bad, but it is not very convenient to take a car around."
1,"总体不错,就是卫生间小点,一直都住该洒店,价308元,现在却提为348元了,不会再住了.","Overall is good, that is, the bathroom is small, and I have always lived in the sprinkle shop. The price is 308 yuan, but now it is 348 yuan, and I will not live anymore."
1,"说是临湖实际离巢湖太远了.不过总的来说,服务员的服务质量还是不错的,最好的是里面的餐饮,味道不错,比外面的饭店好吃","It is said that Linhu is actually too far from Chaohu Lake. However, in general, the service quality of the waiter is still good. The best is the catering inside."
1,"由于到店时间为凌晨1:00多，因此,估计房间比我预定的要升一个档次，很宽敞。而且早上可以看到外面的景色及鸟的叫声。不过早上是被鸟叫的声音吵醒的……室内有保险柜，感觉没太大用处；有冰箱，比较实用……早餐不好吃，不知道是多少钱的标准……","Since the time to the store is more than 1:00 in the morning, it is estimated that the room is one grade than I booked, which is very spacious.And in the morning, you can see the scenery outside and the sound of birds.However, in the morning, it was awakened by the sound of birds ... There are safe in the room, which feels not very useful; there is a refrigerator, which is more practical ... breakfast is not delicious, I don’t know how much is the standard ..."
1,比较朴实的一家酒店～～～还是上海衡山管理旗下，有些亲切感,A more simple hotel ~~~ It is still a subsidiary of Shanghai Hengshan Management.
1,环境不错，在市区内但还挺安静。服务人员很规范，但在细节方面有欠缺，在办完入住手续后，我要自己提着行李去找住宿的楼，楼上也没有提示，还要自己去问，行李少还好，行李要多还真挺累。,"The environment is good, but it is quite quiet in the urban area.The service staff is very standardized, but there is a lack of details. After finishing check -in, I have to take my luggage to find the building of the accommodation. There is no prompt upstairs. I have to ask myself.It's really tired."
1,酒店位置很好，房间也很舒服，下次还会入住。,"The hotel location is very good, and the room is very comfortable. I will stay next time."
1,酒店除了大堂小了点之外，其他都不错房间装修也挺不错，作为4星酒店，足够了比较难得的是，房间还送矿泉水，比较5星待遇了,"In addition to the lobby is a little smaller, the room decoration is also pretty good. As a 4 -star hotel, it is enough to be rare. The room is also given mineral water."
1,经朋友强烈推荐而入住此酒店，中肯地评价一下：设施还可以，服务人员态度也好，交通还算便利，价格也合适，安排了印有客人名字的欢迎单。但有几个情况必须说一下：,"After being strongly recommended by my friends, they stayed in this hotel. They evaluated it: the facilities are okay, the attitude of the service staff is good, the transportation is convenient, and the price is appropriate. The welcome list printed with the name of the guests is arranged.But there are a few situations that must be said:"
1,"初一住在这家宾馆,感觉服务还算是不错,只是正好过年时候,餐厅打烊比较早,想想人家也不容易,对丽水总的印象,感觉当地人都比较纯朴,人也比较热心.","Living in this hotel in the first day, I feel that the service is pretty good, but just when the New Year, the restaurant is closer earlier. It is not easy to think about people. I feel that the locals are relatively simple and enthusiastic."
1,总体来说荣昌的服务态度还算可以的，房间也比较干净。但是个人认为南北湖的门票80/人，有点贵，而且也不值。因为去的时候已是晚上十点多了，如果有当地人的带进去的话，门票可以打折。,"In general, Rongchang's service attitude is okay, and the room is relatively clean.However, I personally think that the tickets of the North and South Lake 80/person are a bit expensive and worth it.Because it was more than ten o'clock in the evening, if there were locals brought in, tickets could be discounted."
1,"荣昌整体不错,环境很美,服务员很客气,还会选择这里!就是南北湖景区门票太贵了80元,如果以后还是80元,宁可不去,永远不去!因为不值!","Rongchang is good as a whole, the environment is beautiful, the waiter is very polite, and you will choose here! The tickets for the North and South Lake Scenic Area are too expensive. If it is 80 yuan in the future, it would rather not go, never go! Because it is not worth it!"
1,环境还不错，我姐她们指定住的地方，住过很多次了喜欢。。。,The environment is not bad. The place where my sister is designated has lived many times and liked it many times.EssenceEssence
1,"房间干净,春节期间泳池水很清.客房服务生态度很好.但前台接待人员须提高素质.结帐后不能及时对信用卡担保进行解除.","The room is clean, and the pool water is very clear during the Spring Festival. The guest room service is very good. However, the front desk reception personnel must improve the quality. After checkout, the credit card guarantee cannot be lifted in time."
1,很不错的，同展馆附近其他几家比，性价比是最高的，吃喝买东西都极方便。不足就是要自己跑到马路上叫车，不过天津的酒店服务也差不多都如此。,"Very good, the other than the other near the exhibition hall are the highest cost -effective, and it is very convenient to eat and drink.The shortcomings are to run on the road to call the car, but the hotel services in Tianjin are almost the same."
1,去之前在网上找莫干山住宿的资料，很少。怕山上条件太差，就定了最贵的这个住宿的地方。酒店房间不多，活动范围不大，而且基本算不提供正餐，早饭的话起的晚了，问经理，经理很NICE，还是提供了本来十点就结束的早饭。水流和空调我感觉还是正常，不像之前有人说的水小，不过我订的是豪华大床房，如果是别的再便宜点的房间，和员工共用卫生设备，真的是很不方便。但是风景好的房间真的很少，大多是没有阳台的，牧师别墅就是在杜月笙别墅后面的象副楼一样的，估计以前是佣人住的，我们住的大概是主人房，边上还有一间说是主卧，有两个阳台，杜月笙住过的，也是最贵的一间。感觉不是非常值得。到达之后问晚餐，看经理比较为难，说会所准备的菜少，估计也没有什么好吃的。同时经理强烈推荐凤祥山庄，就在他们边上，提供晚餐，我们就去看了看菜单。本来想经理看上去人不错，应该不会推荐错，没想到凤祥的老板娘就是典型的黑店的老板娘。菜奇贵无比，而且话说的很难听。看我们出门不打算吃了，竟然跟了很远的路，一路在后面像苍蝇一样盯着你说。夸张的是第二天吃午饭前，她竟然到了我们住的饭店，还想讨论下去问我们前一天哪里去吃的。还说菜单上是这样写的，他们可以讲价的什么什么。到莫干山的筒子们，提醒大家一定要避开凤祥山庄。第一天晚上我们车子开到了蒋介石住过的武陵园，是一个饭店也提供晚餐，菜多而且全，价格也可以接受，因为接待旅游团，因此保证菜很新鲜。而且个人觉得这个饭店住宿的风景也很好。下次去准备住在那里了。还有莫干山庄好像也不错。,"Before going, I found the information about Mogan Mountain accommodation before going.I was afraid that the conditions on the mountain were too poor, so I set the most expensive place to stay.There are not many hotel rooms, the scope of activities is not large, and basically not provided meals. The breakfast is late. Ask the manager, the manager is very nice, and it provides breakfast that was originally ended at ten o'clock.I still feel normal about water and air conditioners. Unlike the water that someone said before, but I have ordered a large -scale bedroom. If it is another cheaper room, it is really inconvenient to share health equipment with employees.However, there are really very few rooms with good scenery. Most of them have no balcony. The pastor villa is like a deputy building behind Du Yuesheng villa. It is estimated that the servant lived before.It is said that it is the master bedroom. There are two balconies. Du Yuesheng lived, and it is also the most expensive one.It feels not worth it.After arriving at the dinner, it is difficult to see the manager. It is estimated that there is not much delicious food prepared by the club.At the same time, the manager strongly recommended Fengxiang Villa, just on them, providing dinner, and we went to see the menu.Originally, the manager seemed to be good. It should not be recommended. I did not expect that Fengxiang's boss is the typical black shop's boss.Cai Qi is extremely expensive, and it is very ugly.Seeing that we did n’t plan to eat when we went out, we even followed the road, staring at you like a flies behind.The exaggeration was that before lunch the next day, she went to the restaurant where we lived, and wanted to discuss and ask where we went to eat the day before.He also said that the menu was written like this, and what they can bargain.When you go to Mogan Mountains, remind everyone to avoid Fengxiang Villa.On the first night, our car drove to the Wuding Garden where Chiang Kai -shek lived. It is a restaurant that also provides dinner. There are many dishes and full. The price is acceptable. Because of receiving tourism groups, it is guaranteed to ensure that the dishes are fresh.And I personally think that the scenery of this restaurant is also very good.Go to live there next time.And Mogan Villa seems to be good."
1,杜月笙别墅坐落在莫干山后山腰的山谷中，环境非常幽静，视野开阔，郁郁葱葱。楼前的平台，是晚餐的绝佳之处，烛光之中，美酒佳肴，可人相拥，仿佛身在仙景。,"Du Yuesheng villa is located in the valley of the mountainside behind Mogan Mountain. The environment is very quiet, the field of vision is wide, and it is lush.The platform in front of the building is an excellent place for dinner. In the candlelight, wine and wine are embracing each other, as if in the fairy view."
1,这个五一在张家界这个美丽的山区度过，住在了湘电国际酒店，留下了深刻的印象。使得我不得不在这里留言。首先说服务：1.有专门的酒店车到机场接，开始我以为是类似过去的酒店机场专用的穿梭接驳车，结果到了才知道，酒店是专门的车专属服务的。感谢司机帅哥宋师傅一直在机场等我。飞机晚点，师傅一直没有离开，真的很感恩。2.到了酒店，很晚了，感谢酒店的销售专员彭小姐专门的等候。顺便说一声，我发现这个酒店的美女很养眼，销售专员美女，前台的小妹是美女，第二天的导游是美女。哈哈，很靓很亲切！张家界此行，我充分感受到了湖南妹子的靓丽和亲切。然后说点别的：1.客房是中式的装修，很棒！山景房开窗就看到了很美的山色，一赞！2.酒店的园林式景观，很棒！一赞！3.西式早餐显得有点湖南的西式，哈哈，过得去啦。第二天的中餐，我和女友点了个山菌炖土鸡，哇，很久没有喝到过那么鲜美的鸡汤了！强烈推荐！4.酒店可以办理多日入园证件，张家界的门票是两日进山有效的。这个对喜欢在山中多住几天的人来说，简直是一种不可思议的享受！我已经有了安排父母到这样的山清水秀的地方多住几天了的冲动了。然后说点美中不足：1.酒店应该是新装修，房间有点装修的味道。2.房间洗手间略显小了一点。3.酒店的娱乐设施大多没有开业，甚憾！总之，强烈推荐这个酒店。,"This May Day spent in the beautiful mountainous area of Zhangjiajie and lived in the Xiangdian International Hotel, leaving a deep impression.I have to leave a message here.First of all, the service: 1. There are special hotel cars to the airport to pick up. At the beginning, I thought it was a dedicated shuttle shuttle bus similar to the past hotel airport. As a result, the hotel was dedicated to the exclusive car.Thanks to the driver handsome, Master Song, who has been waiting for me at the airport.Late plane, the master has never left, and I am really grateful.2. At the hotel, it is very late. Thank you Miss Peng for the sales commissioner of the hotel.By the way, I found that the beauty of this hotel was very eye -catching, the sales commissioner beauty, the little girl at the front desk was a beauty, and the tour guide the next day was a beauty.Haha, very beautiful and kind!In this trip to Zhangjiajie, I fully felt the beauty and kindness of Hunan girls.Then say something else: 1. The guest room is Chinese decoration, great!The mountain view room opened the window and saw a beautiful mountain color, like it!2. The garden -style landscape of the hotel is great!A praise!3. Western breakfast looks a bit western -style in Hunan, haha, it's time to live.The Chinese food the next day, my girlfriend ordered a stewed chicken with mountain bacteria. Wow, I haven't drank such a delicious chicken soup for a long time!highly recommended!4. Hotels can apply for a number of days of entry into the park. Tickets in Zhangjiajie are valid for two days.This is an incredible enjoyment for those who like to live in the mountains for a few days!I have arranged my parents to have a few more days of the mountains and rivers.Then say that there is a shortage of beauty: 1. The hotel should be a new decoration, and the room has a little decoration.2. The toilet in the room is slightly smaller.3. Most of the hotel's entertainment facilities have not opened, regrettable!In short, this hotel is highly recommended."
1,4月中旬，恰逢阴雨连绵，张家界别样的山水风光令人流连忘返。入住湘电酒店：1、房间舒适，一觉到大天亮；2、离景区非常近，凭《度假休闲客人证》可多次出入景区；3、免费机场接机，省心省事；4、大堂周经理等人的服务态度一流，有宾至如归的感觉。其它：1、宾馆部分尚在装修，稍有杂乱地方；2、记得带上两张一寸照片，做《度假休闲客人证》用。,"In mid -April, it coincided with the rainy and rainy, and the scenery of the Zhangjiajie -like landscape was lingering.Check in Xiangdian Hotel: 1. The room is comfortable, and it is dawn as soon as it feels;Manager Zhou and others have a first -class service attitude, and they feel like a guest to return.Others: 1. The hotel is still decorated with a slightly messy place."
1,很好的一间酒店！中式花园设计景观优美；房间刚作翻新，没有残旧的感觉，一赞。服务员态度良好，乐于帮助客人解决问题及安排行程，再赞！有单程免费接送，客人抵达张家界时无须操心交通，三赞！但要注意，那个多次进出森林公园的通行证，只适用于黄石寨入口；另外酒店的位置离城区较远，打车不容易啊！,"A good hotel!The design of the Chinese garden is beautiful; the room is just refurbished, and there is no old feeling, like a praise.The waiter has a good attitude, willing to help guests solve problems and arrange schedules, and praise again!There is a one -way free pick -up, and the guests do not need to worry about traffic when they arrive in Zhangjiajie, three likes!However, it should be noted that the passage of that entry and leaving the forest park many times is only applicable to the entrance of Huangshi Village. In addition, the location of the hotel is far from the city, and it is not easy to take a taxi!"
1,酒店对面的电器城的喇叭很吵所以记得要住后栋(B栋).后栋很安静.190元感觉值得.若能提供早餐更好.若再到河源还会住这间酒店.,"The horn of the electrical city opposite the hotel is very noisy, so remember to stay in the back building (building B). The back building is very quiet. It feels worth it. If you can provide breakfast, it will be better. If you arrive in Heyuan, you will live in this hotel."
1,酒店的整体服务意识相当好，从办理登记入住、用餐、退房等方面都是五星级的服务。入住当晚我们想外出品尝当地特色菜，随意咨询到酒店前台员工，他们主动给我们介绍，最后还利用下班时间陪同我们外出，给我们特别深刻的印象，以后出差，我还会选择富盈酒店。,"The overall service awareness of the hotel is quite good. It is a five -star service from the aspects of registration, dining, and check -in.On the night of staying, we wanted to go out to taste local specialty dishes, and consult the front desk staff at the hotel at will. They took the initiative to introduce us. Finally, we also used our time to accompany us to go out to give us a particularly deep impression. In the future, I will choose Fugui Hotel."
1,2006年有住过，因酒店的服务、性价比高，所以这次还是住富盈。不同的是酒店的服务意识更高了，客房重新装修过，换上液晶电视、床上用品更舒服，感觉房间豪华气派了。一楼西餐厅晚餐食物又变换了，既丰富又可口，在菲律宾乐队演奏，巧克喷泉悠悠转动中，还有那闻乐而舞的喷泉中，感觉好极了。补充点评2007年11月17日：富盈酒店真的不错，物有所值，推荐给大家！,"I lived in 2006. Because the hotel's service and cost -effectiveness are high, this time I still live in Fuying.The difference is that the hotel's awareness of service is higher. The rooms have been renovated. It is more comfortable to put on LCD TVs and bedding. It feels luxurious in the room.The food on the first floor of the western restaurant has changed again, which is rich and delicious. In the Philippines band, the chocolate fountain turns leisurely, and there is also the fountain that dances dancing. It feels great.Supplementary comment on November 17, 2007: Fugiyu Hotel is really good, it is worthwhile, recommend it to everyone!"
1,很喜欢这家酒店，是我住过的五星级酒店里性价比最高的一间。交通便利，就在厚街的高速路口。酒店最让我难忘的是二楼的那间日本料理，铁板烧的味道美极了，服务员和主厨的态度都非常好。晚上入店比较晚了，在西餐厅叫了意大利面味道也很棒，下次还会选择这间酒店,I like this hotel very much. It is the most cost -effective room for five -star hotels I have lived.Convenient transportation is at the highway intersection in Houjie.The most memorable of the hotel is the Japanese cuisine on the second floor. The flavor of the iron plate is extremely beautiful. The attitude of the waiters and the chef is very good.It's late to enter the store at night. It is also great to call the pasta in the Western restaurant. I will choose this hotel next time.
1,房间还算大，但设施一般考虑其地理位置与性价比，还是不错的。特别是对住宿标准有严格要求的时候,"The room is quite large, but the facilities generally consider their geographical location and cost -effectiveness, which is still good.Especially when there are strict requirements for accommodation standards"
1,订的是标准间。房间设施本人认为4星稍微差点，服务4星没有问题。早餐也可以。就是地理位置偏一点，但秦皇岛不大，还可以忍受。,"The standard room is booked.The room facility I think that 4 stars are almost almost almost, and there is no problem with the service of 4 stars.Breakfast is also fine.It is a bit more geographical, but Qinhuangdao is not large and can still endure it."
1,"酒店工作人员有待培训,自己都不知道自己酒店在哪里,好容易找到了告诉我过了预订时间取消了.不过最后还是让我住了.房间有点旧,不过东西还是挺全的,楼道也是有点味道,但按三星标准来说也还过得去.位置不错,周围餐馆很多,银川的老字号也都是步行10分钟之内.","The hotel staff has to be trained. I don't know where my hotel is. It is easy to find that I have been canceled after the booking time. But in the end, I still live.It tastes, but according to the Samsung standard, it is still good. The location is good, there are many surrounding restaurants, and the old names of Yinchuan are also walking within 10 minutes."
1,酒店挺不错的，服务也好（这个我是很满意的），设施也比较完善，只是早餐品种有点少，位置有点偏，打车不算太方便。下次还会入住的。,"The hotel is pretty good and the service (I am very satisfied with this), the facilities are relatively complete, but the breakfast varieties are a bit less, the location is a bit biased, and it is not too convenient to take a taxi.I will stay next time."
1,床还是挺好的就是大床间满了调成标间，看来还是要早点预订。早餐一般，一大早楼就在大声砸墙和楼板明显的晃动，挺吓人的。晚上洗澡出来的水是黄黄的，洗得身上腻腻的，忽冷忽热的。服务员态度挺好算啦～,"The bed is still very good. The big bed is full of adjustment into a standard room. It seems that you still have to book earlier.Breakfast is average. Early in the morning, the building was shaking obviously on the wall and the floor, which was scary.The water in the bath at night was yellow, and washed greasy, cold and hot.The waiter's attitude is pretty good ~"
1,"很不错的酒店,我入住时订的单人床，425房间，220元，宽带、电话等均为免费。在众多入住的三星级标准里，算是很不错了。另外就是一入房间，酒店的摆设就让人感觉到很温馨，连马桶里都放有花瓣。如果是10分的满分，我给9分。一分是扣除床容易发出响声。宾馆反馈2008年2月1日：非常感谢您选择友好饭店，首先您对酒店的高度评价是对我们工作的莫大肯定，我们会更加努力把工作做得更好；其次，谢谢您提出的问题，酒店今年就要重新装修，我们会有针对性的给予解决；最后，再次感谢您的点评，期盼您的再次光临。","Very good hotel, I booked a single bed when I stay in, room 425, 220 yuan, broadband, telephone, etc. are free.Among the many three -star standards to stay in, it is very good.In addition, as soon as I entered the room, the hotel's furnishings make people feel very warm, and even petals are placed in the toilet.If it is a full score of 10 points, I give 9 points.One point is that the bed is easy to make a noise.Hotel feedback on February 1, 2008: Thank you very much for choosing a friendly hotel. First of all, your high evaluation of the hotel is a great affirmation of our work. We will work harder to make work better; secondThe hotel will be renovated this year, and we will solve it targeted. Finally, thank you again for your comments and look forward to your visit again."
1,酒店比较旧，服务还可以，附近也没什么宾馆了。,"The hotel is old and the service is okay, and there are no hotels nearby."
1,房间很舒服，我个人非常满意，办公台适合我个人的使用习惯且网速好。大床、卫生间都不错。宾馆反馈2008年1月16日：感谢您对大连银帆宾馆的良好评价！近期的商务间升级推广活动受到了很多客人的一致好评，这是对新房间的认可，也是对我们房间进一步优化的良好帮助资源！银帆宾馆欢迎您！如有需要通过总机与我联系！,"The room is very comfortable. I am very satisfied. The office platform is suitable for my personal habits and good network speed.Big beds and bathrooms are good.Hotel feedback on January 16, 2008: Thank you for your good evaluation of Dalian Yinfan Hotel!Recent business upgrade promotion activities have been well received by many guests. This is the recognition of the new room and a good help resource for further optimization of our room!Welcome to Yinfan Hotel!If you need to contact me through the busy aircraft!"
1,"标准的三星标准,跟五星标准是一样的,只是档次看着会低些,但是很干净.房间也比较大.有的房间有小冰箱,有的没有.服务很到位.环境也不错.网速很快,而且不收钱.可以预授权,结帐很快.","The standard Samsung standard is the same as the five -star standard, but the grade will be lower, but it is very clean. The room is relatively large. Some rooms have small refrigerators, some are in place.Soon, and not collecting money. It can be pre -authorized, and the checkout is fast."
1,环境还算可以，房间也算比较干净，因为住的时间短，所以没有特别的感受，服务还是可以接受的，在南三环这样的酒店还不错了。,"The environment is okay. The room is relatively clean. Because the time to live is short, there is no special feeling. The service is still acceptable. Hotels like the South Third Ring Road are not bad."
1,服务，房间都很不错。交通也不错。酒店附近就有很多小饭店，都还不错的。12路公交一直到火车站，很方便。如果下次还去黄山的话肯定还住这家拉。,"The room is very good.The traffic is also good.There are many small restaurants near the hotel, which are not bad.Two bus 12 to the train station is very convenient.If you still go to Huangshan next time, you must still live in this pull."
1,今年已经是第二次入住了，如果是乘坐“直通车”去香港，那么都会海逸是很好的选择！其实从广州转乘“直通车”去香港相比直飞香港既省钱又省麻烦！（出入境手续一般不超过5分钟）携程的价格性价比不错，以前去香港基本上是住在洲际或香格里拉，尽管各方面条件要比都会海逸好，但毕竟价格要高一倍多。在携程网订房后，临时决定提前一天入住，而携程已经订不到房了，只能直接向酒店电话订，价格是携程的一倍。好在那一天是初二，香港有焰火晚会，坐在酒店的海景套房内悠闲地看维多利亚上空的焰火，多花的两千多元只当是观光门票了。,"This year is the second time to stay in. If you go to Hong Kong by ""passing the traffic"", it will be a good choice!In fact, the transfer from Guangzhou to Hong Kong to Hong Kong is both money and trouble than direct flights to Hong Kong!(Entry -exit procedures generally do not exceed 5 minutes.) Ctrip's price is good at cost performance. In the past, he basically lived in intercontinental or Shangri -La in Hong Kong. Although the conditions in various aspects are better than Metropolitan, the price is more than doubled after all.After Ctrip's booking, it was temporarily decided to stay in advance in advance, and Ctrip could not book a house, and could only call directly to the hotel. The price was doubled.Fortunately, that day was the second day. There was a fireworks party in Hong Kong. Sitting in the hotel's sea -view suite leisurely watched the fireworks over Victoria. The more than 2,000 yuan was only a sightseeing ticket."
1,应该算是蚌埠最好的酒店了。地点有点偏所以周围没太多餐饮娱乐场所，但好在名气响所以打车还是蛮方便的。房间和2年前一样干净，但不明白为什么没有免费饮用水、浴缸处有沐浴露而淋浴房里却没有。以4星论是可以的，但5星的话就有点勉强。,"It should be regarded as the best hotel in Bengbu.The location is a bit biased, so there are not many catering and entertainment venues around, but fortunately, it is quite convenient to take a taxi.The room is as clean as 2 years ago, but I don't understand why there is no free drinking water or a shower gel in the bathtub and there is no in the shower room.It is possible to use 4 stars, but 5 stars are a bit reluctant."
1,房间还可以，就是地点稍微偏了些，好在蚌埠也不大。,"The room is okay, that is, the location is slightly tilted, but fortunately, Bengbu is not large."
1,酒店硬件条件不错，服务也挺好，价格合适。只是当地风俗让我们有点受不了，晚上酒店有新人结婚，乐队一直在大门外演奏，异常吵闹。本来酒店身处安静之地的优点被全部破坏了。,"The hotel's hardware conditions are good, the service is also good, and the price is appropriate.It is just that the local customs make us a bit unbearable. At night, there are newcomers to get married in the hotel. The band has been playing outside the door, which is extremely noisy.The advantages of the hotel in the quiet place were destroyed."
1,"房间小,感觉卫生不太好,整个环境显的很陈旧.服务一般.",The room is small and feels not good at hygiene. The whole environment is very old. The service is average.
1,提供免费机场接送，早上出发时，接送的别克商务车随到随发，挺方便。,"Provide free airport pickups. When departing in the morning, the Buick commercial vehicle that is delivered is very convenient."
1,"前台服务非常好,到的时候由于开会没有我预定的房间了,自动帮我升级到了套房,房间很干净,酒店整体性价比都很高,只是如果不坐车的话就需要走大概100米的上坡路了哦!不过锻炼身体也是不错的,总的来说很满意,以后还会住的.","The front desk service is very good. At the time of the meeting, there is no room I booked. I will automatically upgrade to the suite. The room is very clean. The overall cost performance of the hotel is very high. However! But exercising is also good. Generally speaking, I am very satisfied, and I will live in the future."
1,酒店虽然比较老但我入住的行政楼很好，房间大还配有电脑价格方面很有竞争力的,"Although the hotel is older, the administrative building I stayed in is very good."
1,酒店是四星的，服务不错，晚上还送点心。酒店的设施是按四星标准，但可能时间比较长了，设施有点老化，显得比较旧了。不过整体来说还是不错的。,"The hotel is four -star, the service is good, and the snacks are also given at night.The hotel's facilities are according to the four -star standard, but it may be longer, the facilities are a bit aging, and it looks older.But it is still good overall."
1,服务不错，还有特殊服务，我感觉四川的确是适合居住的地方！我喜欢,"The service is good, and there are special services. I feel that Sichuan is indeed suitable for living!I like"
1,装修典雅，服务到位！在当地已经算很好的了，吃的有点辣！,"Elegant decoration and in place!The local area is already very good, eating a bit spicy!"
1,房间很干净的，很多细节都考虑到了，hellokitty的拖鞋很可爱，有四星的标准，同事们都挺满意。靠山的房间有阳台，景色很不错。服务非常的好，在上海似乎找不到这样的服务标准。泡温泉的地方毛巾很多，随时准备着。温泉的品种也不少，人很多。餐饮也算是挺好的，品种多，服务很好。在那里很放松，下次还会去的。,"The room is very clean. Many details are considered. Hellokitty's slippers are cute. There are four -star standards, and colleagues are quite satisfied.The backing room has a balcony, and the scenery is very good.The service is very good, it seems that such service standards cannot be found in Shanghai.There are a lot of towels in hot springs and are ready at any time.There are also many types of hot springs and many people.Catering is also pretty good, there are many varieties and good services.It's very relaxed there, and I will go next time."
1,酒店向后的不错，很宽大的阳台，望向山水，空气清新，温泉也很舒服，但相对餐食比较贵也比较单调，不过出门过国道对面有些大排档，鸡煲的味道还不错。,"The hotel is good backward. The wide balcony is looking at the landscape, the air is fresh, and the hot spring is very comfortable, but the meals are more expensive and monotonous."
1,"不错,装潢,床单,摆设,让人感觉很温馨,越来越爱如家了.","Yes, decoration, sheets, and furnishings make people feel very warm, and love is more and more loved."
1,我订的是豪华间，房间比较小，而且床也小，一点都不像豪华间，如果这样是豪华间不知道标间是不是更小？但我第二天换了个房间，就大很多，感觉很不一样。,"I booked a luxurious room, the room is relatively small, and the bed is small, and it is not like a luxury room. If this is a luxury room, I do n’t know if the standard room is smaller?But I changed a room the next day, it was much bigger, and it felt very different."
1,酒店在闹市区，大床间不多，服务生的态度很好，见到客人都会微笑致意。房间的窗户不隔音，晚上会比较吵。,"The hotel is in the downtown area, there are not many beds, and the waiter's attitude is very good. When you see the guests, you will smile.The windows of the room are not soundproof, and it will be more noisy at night."
1,"满好的酒店,下次去还会住的!值得推荐!其他的倒没什么","A good hotel, I will live next time! It is worth recommending! Others are nothing"
1,我住在7楼的单人间，房间较小，而且不是玻璃隔断的浴室，设施还可以。酒店离车站很近，打车6块，在市中心，服务还可以，早餐可以接受，就是西餐的品种较少，以后去徐州还会考虑入住。,"I live in a single room on the 7th floor. The room is small, and it is not a glass partition bathroom. The facilities are okay.The hotel is very close to the station. 6 yuan for taxis. In the city center, the service is OK. Breakfast can be accepted. That is, there are fewer Western food varieties. In the future, you will consider staying in Xuzhou."
1,交通便利，从酒店去大巴扎只要起步价就到了。房间也舒适，就是隔音不怎么好，隔壁声音听得见，正好碰上隔壁打牌，同前台打电话后，前台派人跟隔壁说了，就不吵了。总体不错。服务不错。,"The transportation is convenient, as long as the starting price is available from the hotel.The room is also comfortable, that is, the sound insulation is not very good. The sound of the next door can be heard. I just met the card next door. After the front desk called the front desk, the front desk sent someone to say to the next door, so I would not make noisy.Overall.The service is good."
1,"新疆普遍服务意识较差,所以能有伊力特这样的服务已经很满意了.房间很大,就是窗玻璃太脏了.卫生间要赞一下:淋浴间很好,镜子是防雾的,中间一块永远不会有水汽上去.惊喜的是每天赠送水果盆,我超级喜欢.订的是大床房,床很大,睡的很舒服.酒店位置好,周围商店多,到五一夜市步行即可.原来担心延街会不会晚上太吵,事后觉得是多虑了.如果下次到乌鲁木齐,我还是会选择伊力特,因为性价比还是比较高的.","Xinjiang's universal service awareness is poor, so it is very satisfied with the service such as Iltt. The room is very large, that is, the window glass is too dirty. The bathroom must be praised: the shower is very good, the mirror is anti -fog, and the middle piece will never never.There will be water vapor to go up. The surprise is to give the water pot every day. I really like it. I order a large bed room, the bed is very large, and the sleep is very comfortable. The hotel location is good, there are many surrounding shops.I was worried that Yanjie would be too noisy at night, and I felt a lot of care afterwards. If I arrived at Urumqi next time, I would still choose Ilite, because the cost -effectiveness is still relatively high."
1,"国庆节的新疆之旅有五天时间都在该酒店度过,非常满意,住惯大城市的我原本做好了一切去到新疆要将就着窝居几晚的思想准备,但一进酒店房间----心情用两个字可以形容""惊喜"",房间里干净\舒适\用品齐全,然后再感受新疆人民好客热情的服务,每天都有个一新鲜可口的果盘赠送;到餐厅就餐,服务员笑脸相迎,逢问必答;在商务中心,我们作为散客,跟与酒店合作的妇女旅行社的团,接待的小姐非常热情,把一切都安排得非常周到,还把附近吃的\购物的地方全部用纸列出来给我们参考,真的非常不错!对了,就连酒店里那家商店卖东西的阿姨都很NICE~~下次如果有机会再去新疆,我还会住那里的.","The trip to Xinjiang on the National Day has been spent in the hotel for five days. I am very satisfied. I used to live in a big city. I had done everything to go to Xinjiang to prepare for a few nights.Room ---- Mood can be described as ""surprise"" in two words. The room is clean \ comfortable \ complete products, and then feel the enthusiastic service of the Xinjiang people's hospitality. Every day, there is a fresh and delicious fruit disc;The waiter welcomes each other with a smile, and you must answer every question; in the business center, as a group of women travel agencies who cooperates with the hotel, we are very enthusiastic about the ladies who receive them.All places are listed with paper for us for reference, it is really good! By the way, even the aunt who sells things in the hotel in the hotel is very nice ~~ If you have a chance to go to Xinjiang next time, I will live thereThen, then"
1,今年9月份去的，设施很好。有一张躺椅，很是惬意。服务员服务态度很好，恰逢我过生日，还有电话祝贺及赠送国盘，在边疆由此待遇很是享受。酒店西式早餐38元美味，品种较齐全，性价比高。距离五一夜市咫尺之遥。附近一家早餐点（汉餐）经济实惠。补充点评2007年9月27日：另外，酒店铺的是纯羊毛地毯，走进房间，感觉味道很清新，没有刺鼻的羊膻味。但是千万注意不要弄脏了，赔偿金额很高。,"I went in September this year, and the facilities were very good.There is a lounge chair, which is very comfortable.The waiter's service attitude is very good. It coincides with my birthday, as well as calls and giving away the national market. The treatment in the frontier is very enjoyable.The hotel Western -style breakfast is 38 yuan delicious, the variety is relatively complete, and the cost -effective is high.Far -one -night market is close.A nearby breakfast (Han Meal) is economical.Supplementary comment on September 27, 2007: In addition, the hotel shop is pure wool carpet. When you walk into the room, it feels fresh and there is no pungent lamb.But be careful not to stain, and the amount of compensation is high."
1,这次去新疆旅游在伊力特住了3天，酒店的位置不错，走路去五一路吃饭5分钟。房间挺大，地毯也挺干净，设备中归中矩，由于在长江路边，有些吵。前台的服务也挺热情，但是结账的时候比较慢。,"This time I went to Xinjiang to travel in Ili for 3 days. The hotel is in a good position. Walking to May 1st Road for 5 minutes.The room was quite large, and the carpet was very clean. The equipment was returned to the middle. Because of the noise on the side of the Yangtze River Road.The front desk service is also very enthusiastic, but it is slower when checking out."
1,房间宽敞，装修比较舒适，但是冲淋房设计不合理，须将浴缸和冲淋房隔开。,"The room is spacious and the decoration is relatively comfortable, but the design of the flushing room is unreasonable, and the bathtub must be separated from the punching room."
1,很好的酒店，设施和服务都让人满意，就是偏远了一点。,"Very good hotels, facilities and services are satisfactory, that is, remote."
1,房间真的很一般，早餐品种不是很多，没有什么突出的地方,"The room is really average, there are not many breakfast varieties, there are no prominent places"
1,不错的酒店，要求延迟退房，第一次同意延到下午1:00，第二次电话，延到了下午2:00。缺点：房间隔音不好，能听到隔壁房间电视、衣架的声音，和人声,"A good hotel requires a delay to check out. The first time I agreed to postponed to 1:00 pm, and the second call was postponed to 2:00 pm.Disadvantages: The room sound insulation is not good. You can hear the sound of the TV and hanger next door, the sound of the hanger, and the vocal vocal"
1,"因为在萧山开年会,所以预定了这家酒店,虽然叫宾馆,但是感觉真的是不错,很漂亮,虽然叫4星,其实感觉已经够5星标准了.只是觉得杭州的出租车很难叫,4点30就","Because the annual meeting in Xiaoshan, I booked this hotel. Although it is called a hotel, it feels really good. It is very beautiful. Although it is called 4 stars, I actually feel that it is enough for 5 stars.Call, just at 4:30"
1,实惠，位置也可，设施好，物有所值。推荐。,"It is affordable, the location is also available, the facilities are good, and the things are worth it.recommend."
1,"环境不错,装修也挺新，但房间小了点，洗浴间与睡房之间是用工艺玻璃相隔的，人在里面洗澡，在睡房能若隐若现地看见。如果是情侣，那是相当的性感，看着情人若稳若现的裸体呼之欲出，极容易遐想连翩，继而鼻血横流，继而破门而入，继而……。但夫妻与子女同行，若三四岁以下还好，大了，就相当尴尬。唯有把孩子抓进被窝里讲地下党如何埋伏斗争的革命故事。","The environment is good, and the decoration is quite new, but the room is a bit smaller. Between the bathroom and the bedroom, the glass is separated by process glass. People take a bath inside and see it looming in the bedroom.If it is a couple, it is quite sexy. Looking at the lover's stable nakedness, it is very easy to think of it, then the nosebleeds flow, and then break into the door, then ...But the couple and their children are walking under the age of three or four, and they are very embarrassing.Only the revolutionary stories of how to catch the children into the bed tell the underground party how to ambush the struggle."
1,地理位置好，在长春最好的商业街上，晚上购物极为方便。酒店服务不错，我来时客人较多但办理入住蛮快的。进入房间时房间已经开了空调。很好了在长春普通四星级酒店标间都得三百大多了，也都一般。早餐是否可加点品种。,"The geographical location is good. On the best commercial street in Changchun, shopping at night is extremely convenient.The hotel service is good. When I came, I had a lot of guests, but it was quite fast to check in.When entering the room, the room was turned on.Very good, there are more than 300 in Changchun ordinary four -star hotel standard rooms, and they are also average.Whether breakfast can be added with some varieties."
1,第一次入住长春国际大厦酒店，大堂明堂音乐清柔。前台办理入住很快，房间壁纸有些旧但很干净，我扣子掉了要了青色线服务员很热情帮我缝上了。感谢，在地理位置这么好的地段房间价格低房间干净可以了值得推荐。,"The first time I stayed at the Changchun International Building Hotel, the lobby Mingtang music was soft.The front desk was handled quickly, and the wallpaper in the room was a little old but clean. I had a button and asked the green line waiter to help me sew.Thanks, the price of rooms in such a good location in such a good location is clean. It is worth recommending."
1,交通便利，酒店位于商业中心。前台服务好，房间整洁干净。下次还会入住。,"Convenient transportation, the hotel is located in the commercial center.The front desk is good, and the room is neat and clean.I will stay in the next time."
1,感觉还不错，房间干净，舒服，具有五星酒店的质数，服务态度还可以，因为觉得服务员有点冷淡。最不好的是地方比较偏，酒店所处位置说得好听的是新城区，直白的就是差不多就是郊区了，好在汕头并不大，到市区繁华的地方也花不了多少时间。另外，酒店附近有一间酒楼，名字叫快活海鲜城，不错。装修上档次，但价钱不贵，出品好，值得推荐。,"It feels pretty good, the room is clean, comfortable, the quality of the five -star hotel, the service attitude is okay, because I feel that the waiter is a bit cold.The worst is that the place is relatively biased. The location of the hotel is nice to the new city. The straightforward thing is almost the suburbs. Fortunately, Shantou is not large, and it does not take much time to the bustling place in the urban area.In addition, there is a restaurant near the hotel, named Khamishi Seafood City, which is good.The decoration is on the same level, but the price is not expensive, the production is good, it is worth recommending."
1,地理位置优越，吃住行相当方便！房间设施一般，但对得起三星标准！房价优惠幅度不大。总体来说值得下一次再来！,"The geographical location is superior, and it is very convenient to eat and live!The room facilities are average, but it is worthy of the Samsung standard!The price of house prices is not large.Overall it is worth the next time!"
1,搂里有个鸭王烤鸭，地段好，在徐家汇地区，这个地段价格还可以的酒店也就这家了。补充点评2008年4月1日：我们找了下这个价位的，这个地段的，没找出第二家。没竞争。唯一的天平宾馆，也是比不上它的地段。,"There is a duck king roast duck, the location is good, in the Xujiahui area, the hotel where the price is okay is also the same.Supplementary comment on April 1, 2008: We found this price, and we did not find the second one in this area.No competition.The only Tianping Hotel is not comparable to it."
1,如果为了购物，地段绝对好。但是，毕竟是闹市区稍微有点吵难免的。补充点评2008年4月1日：今天是4月1日，但我说的确实是实际情况。,"If you want to shop, the location is absolutely good.However, after all, it is a bit noisy in the downtown area.Supplementary comment on April 1, 2008: Today is April 1, but what I said is indeed the actual situation."
1,地段是很好，离徐家汇地铁站很近，各个出路口都没几步路，性价比在上海算不错了，下次还会入住，主要方便，购物也方便，出行更方便。,"The location is very good. It is very close to the Xujiahui Metro Station. There are not a few steps in the intersection of each outlet. The cost -effectiveness is good in Shanghai. I will stay in it next time. It is mainly convenient, convenient for shopping, and more convenient travel."
1,还可以，为什么要多于20个字？为什么啊，为什么？够了吗？,"Okay, why are there more than 20 words?Why, why?Is it enough?"
1,这个酒店真不错，位置好，房间很干净，下次来还会选择这个酒店,"This hotel is really good, the location is good, and the room is very clean. I will choose this hotel next time"
1,"酒店本来就是超5星的硬件配置的,2001-2006都住过,价格降了不少!位置太偏是致命的问","The hotel was originally a hardware configuration of over 5 stars. It has been lived in 2001-2006, and the price has dropped a lot! The location is too fatal."
1,房间设备还不错，可以说得上是三星级，不过那个早餐实在不敢恭维，携程上加一份早餐是35元，在所谓的观景餐厅，结果那里小的出奇，而且自助早餐的品种实在少，水果也不新鲜。第一次住的是双床标间，房间设备比较新，比较舒服，第二次要了一个大床房间，结果是西晒的格局很不规范的大床房间，当时提出换房间，那个前台小姐态度极其不好，在那里发牢骚，很不情愿，这个和所谓的四星级就相差太多了。的确让我郁闷了一下，不知道是不是携程特价的原因。不过那里的门童还不错。,"The room equipment is not bad. It can be said to be a Samsung level, but the breakfast is really dare to compliment. Ctrip adds a breakfast for 35 yuan. In the so -called viewing restaurant, it is surprisingly small there, and the buffet breakfast variety varieties.There are really few, and the fruits are not fresh.The first time I lived in the double bed standard room. The room equipment was relatively new and comfortable. The second time I asked a large bed room. As a result, the west -tanning pattern was very irregular. At that time, the room was proposed.The attitude is extremely bad, and there is a complaint there, very reluctant, this is too much different from the so -called four -star.It really made me depressed, I don't know if it was the reason for Ctrip.But the doorboy there is not bad."
1,10月10日入住，从外观来看，酒店本身怎么也不像是5星级酒店。内部装璜不错，我入住的是6210房间，由于房间临街，且面对的是交通主干道，感觉隔音效果不好。最近几日由于降温，天津比较凉，但遗憾的是酒店没有供暖，在房间里时间长了感觉比较冷。其他的都还可以了，但是由于隔音和供暖的缘故，只能给4分。,"Checking on October 10th, from the appearance, the hotel itself is not like a 5 -star hotel.The interior decoration is good. I stay in Room 6210. Because the room is on the street and faces the main road of transportation, it feels that the sound insulation effect is not good.In recent days, due to cooling, Tianjin has been cool, but unfortunately, the hotel has no heating, and it feels colder after a long time in the room.Everything else is okay, but because of sound insulation and heating, it can only give 4 points."
1,"酒店位置还可以,比较静,是个住宅区,房间是在别墅里,看上去别墅也有些时日了.房间设施还行,就是价格贵了点,468的大床间有点贵.其余也没有什么特别印象.一般般吧","The location of the hotel is also okay. It is relatively quiet. It is a residential area. The room is in the villa. It seems that the villa is also a time. The room facilities are okay, that is, the price is a bit expensive.Special impression."
1,酒店的房间太小了，一点没有5星酒店的感觉。前台给人的感觉好像是3星酒店。不过服务员的态度还是很好的！,"The hotel's room is too small, and there is no feeling of a 5 -star hotel at all.The front desk feels like a 3 -star hotel.But the waiter's attitude is still very good!"
1,"房间很小,酒店比较酒,但服务很好.风景还可以.前台的小妹服务周到也很漂亮","The room is very small, the hotel is more wine, but the service is very good. The scenery is okay."
1,我时12月20号入住5206房间，是行政大床间，我每次通过携程都是订一样的房型。房间是套房的格局。够5星级的标准。确定是宽带每隔两个小时就要断线，过一会儿拔掉网线再接上，又可以上了，这对于我的工作来说比较麻烦。还有就是暖气风口居然直接对着床，而且噪音绝对在63－65分贝左右，（因我的工作性质，随身携带分贝仪的），实在影响休息。还有房门锁的开关比较麻烦，不够方便。早餐最多3星，因为环境原因才给的分数，如果按照食物质量，最多两星。门童服务生不管你手上拿着多少行李，好象只是负责开门，别的坚决不管。,"I stayed in Room 5206 on December 20th, which was a big administrative bed. Every time I passed Ctrip, I had the same room type.The room is the pattern of a suite.Enough for 5 -star standards.It is determined that the broadband must be disconnected every two hours. After a while, the network cable is removed and then connected, which can be on, which is more troublesome for my work.There is also the heating air outlet directly facing the bed, and the noise is definitely about 63-65 decibels (because of my work nature, carrying the decibel device with me), it really affects the rest.There is also the switch of the door lock is more troublesome, which is not convenient enough.Breakfast is at most 3 stars, and the score given by environmental reasons. If the quality of food, up to two stars.No matter how much luggage you are holding on your hand, the waiter seems to be just responsible for opening the door, and other resoluteness."
1,价格实惠，基本还可以宾馆反馈2008年4月17日：希望下次再入住本酒店。,"The price is affordable, and it is basically a hotel feedback on April 17, 2008: I hope to stay in the hotel next time."
1,酒店位置不是很好，，但是房间还是可以的，很大。宾馆反馈2008年7月2日：您好！感谢您的评论，我酒店是位于大连市西部商业中心，毗邻星海广场和星海会展中心，酒店周边环境相对来说差一些，酒店正在努力加以改善，希望我们酒店的周到服务会迎来您的下次光临！,"The hotel location is not very good, but the room is still OK, very large.Hotel feedback on July 2, 2008: Hello!Thank you for your comments. Our hotel is located in the western commercial center of Dalian City, adjacent to Xinghai Plaza and Xinghai Exhibition Center. The surrounding environment of the hotel is relatively worse.Live this time!"
1,房间总体还可以，就是没有壁橱（实在没办法说那个活动门后10公分不到的空间是壁橱）有点奇怪。还有就是我住的06号房间有闩锁死的门，不知道通到哪里。。。宾馆的环境还是不错的，服务也算中上水平了。宾馆反馈2008年6月13日：您好！感谢您的评论，房间中间锁死的门是酒店原做连通房用的，现因用处不是很大，正在将门拆掉封死，部分房间已整改完毕，余下房间在本月末完成；壁橱的问题业已反映给领导，酒店会在一个月内整改完毕，谢谢您的关注，诚挚的欢迎您的下次光临！,"The room is generally okay, that is, there is no closet (there is no way to say that the space less than 10 cm behind the activity door is a closet). It is a bit strange.There is also the door of the No. 06 room I live in the door of the lock -up door. I don't know where to get through.EssenceEssenceThe environment of the hotel is still good, and the service is considered to be high.Hotel feedback on June 13, 2008: Hello!Thank you for your comments. The locking door in the middle of the room was originally connected to the hotel. Now because it is not very useful, the door is being disassembled. Some rooms have been rectified. The remaining rooms are completed at the end of this month.The industry has been reflected to the leader. The hotel will be rectified within one month. Thank you for your attention and sincerely welcome your next visit!"
1,房间非常大，硬件设施还不错，不过早餐差了点，房价也属于比较贵的宾馆反馈2008年5月20日：您好！感谢您的建意，酒店的早餐出品现正做调整，期望您的下次光临会达到您的满意！诚挚的欢迎您的下次光临！,"The room is very large, and the hardware facilities are not bad, but the breakfast is a bit worse, and the house price is also a relatively expensive hotel feedback on May 20, 2008: Hello!Thank you for your build, the hotel's breakfast is now adjusting, and your next visit will reach your satisfaction!Sincerely welcome your next visit!"
1,通过携程预订了该酒店，酒店的服务绝对令人满意。我们一行行李较多，服务员专门推来一行李车，帮我们把行李送到我们预定的房间。晚餐后散步时，服务员告诉我们，出大门左手方向走就是海曲公园，非常方便。第二天早上，我又去了海曲公园，里面有一很大的恐龙模型，环境不错。早餐很丰盛，值得称道。任何时候看到服务员，他们总是笑脸相迎，有回家的感觉。个人在前台订房间价格是280元，比携程要贵一点。下次去日照，我还会选择山孚。,"The hotel's service was booked through Ctrip, and the hotel's service was absolutely satisfactory.We have a lot of luggage, and the waiter pushed a group of luggage to help us send our luggage to our scheduled room.When walking after dinner, the waiter told us that walking in the left hand of the door is the Haizou Park, which is very convenient.The next morning, I went to Haicou Park again, with a large dinosaur model, and the environment was good.Breakfast is rich and commendable.Seeing the waiter at any time, they always smile with each other and feel like going home.The price of a room in the front desk is 280 yuan, which is a bit more expensive than Ctrip.Next time I go to Rizhao, I will choose Shanfu."
1,唯一不喜欢的就是那里的菜偏咸。总体还不错，最喜欢的就是有去机场的班车了。,"The only thing I don't like is the salty vegetables there.Overall is pretty good, the favorite is the shuttle bus to the airport."
1,该酒店的服务确实不错，到每一个地方都有工作人员向你鞠躬问好，看得出来是发自内心的。从酒店员工通道到后院停车处，四周墙壁上有很多理念的宣传标语，可以感觉到此酒店的精髓所在。早餐很丰盛，房间也很干净，很值得向携程各位朋友推荐此家酒店。,"The hotel's service is really good. When you go to every place, you will bow to you and ask you, and you can see that it is from the heart.From the hotel employee passage to the parking place in the backyard, there are many propaganda slogans on the four -week wall, which can feel the essence of the hotel.The breakfast is rich and the room is clean. It is worth recommending this hotel to friends of Ctrip."
1,酒店设施倒是满陈旧，不过一楼中餐厅的饭菜却很合我口味。一打听才知道是广东厨师，就为这个，我下次不住雅和了。,"The hotel facilities are all over -old, but the food on the restaurant on the first floor is very good for my taste.As soon as I asked, I knew it was a Guangdong chef. That's for this."
1,在这里住了半个月了，我们一行共住了5个房间，有豪华套房和豪华标准房，感觉酒店的服务不错，酒店所有的人的态度都很好！豪华套房能看到江，整个长江，最好能预定尾数是18的套房。酒店的早餐一般～，我在九江租了自行车，存在酒店，经理对此格外照顾，就是觉得价格在九江没有什么优势，虽然挂4星，其实设施不到4星。酒店的健身房基本上就是摆设，而且还收费～。没有打扰电话。空调到晚上不好，经常热醒的！远洲也这样的！宾馆反馈2008年4月17日：您对酒店挺了解的，非常感谢支持！,"I have lived here for half a month. We live in 5 rooms with luxury suite and luxury standard rooms. I feel that the hotel's service is good, and the attitude of all the people in the hotel is very good!Luxury suite can see Jiang. The entire Yangtze River, it is best to book a pair with 18.The breakfast of the hotel is generally ~, I rented a bicycle in Jiujiang, and there was a hotel. The manager took care of it. I felt that the price had no advantage in Jiujiang. Although I hung 4 stars, the facilities were less than 4 stars.The gym of the hotel is basically a furnishings, and it is also charged ~.No disturbance call.The air conditioner is not good at night, and often wake up!The same is true of Yuanzhou!Hotel feedback on April 17, 2008: You know the hotel very well, thank you very much for your support!"
1,就在解放碑，房间挺干净。楼高，电梯慢。网线接口不好找，呵呵。,"Just in the liberated monument, the room was very clean.The building is high and the elevator is slow.The network cable interface is not easy to find, haha."
1,定的时候刚好特价不到200一晚感觉还不错。但还不是特别方便。,It just feels good when the special offer is less than 200.But it is not particularly convenient.
1,"我喜欢那里,性价比很高地.去太原90%都住在那里的.服务员的服务很不错","I like there, the price is very high. 90%of the Taiyuan live there. The serviceman's service is very good"
1,房间很大，可以和家里的媲美。进门就有种家的感觉，有衣物间，还有厨房。房间不大，但是客厅很大，很舒服。下次去还会选择这里。补充点评2008年7月2日：地理位置不是最好，有点不方便。前台小姐服务很好。,"The room is large and can be comparable to the family.When you enter the door, you feel like a family, there are clothes and kitchens.The room is not large, but the living room is large and comfortable.I will choose here next time.Supplementary review July 2, 2008: Geographical location is not the best, a bit inconvenient.The front desk lady has a good service."
1,总体感觉服务不错的，虽然大堂设在三层有点怪而且22层以下为办公楼，但是好在有两部饭店专用电梯，感觉很安静。这次入住的是精致套房，感觉没有想象中好，但是很干净，因为楼层很高，窗外满眼绿色的风景也是很好的补充，对面就是五台山体育场，正好赶上周六的足球比赛，省了贵宾包房的门票了，呵呵！再有就是，对迎宾果盘和相对宽松的退房时间感觉很好，还是下次去的第一选择！！,"Overall feels that the service is good. Although the lobby is a bit strange on the third floor and below the 22nd floor is the office building, fortunately, there are two special elevators for two restaurants, which feels quiet.This time I stayed in the exquisite suite. I felt that I was not imagined, but it was very clean, because the floor was very high, and the green scenery outside the window was also very good. On the opposite side is the Wutaishan Stadium.Tickets for VIP Baoju, haha!Then, I feel good for the welcome fruit plate and relatively loose check -out time, or the first choice for the next time!Intersection"
1,酒店实际上位于河西路、中十路口，开车上山从河西路左转弯，看见“北京人家”、“金旭菜馆”就好找了。以避暑、度假的心态来评价，应该说还可以,"The hotel is actually located at the intersection of Hexi Road and Zhongyi. Driving up the mountain to the left of Hexi Road, it is easy to find ""Beijing Family"" and ""Jinxu Restaurant"".It should be said that it is okay to evaluate the summer and vacation mentality."
1,地段很好，很方便。服务也算不错。这个价钱还是非常值得的。,The location is very good and convenient.The service is also good.This price is still worth it.
1,"每次到杭州出差,我都是住,面的硬施都不,不若能在格上再降的,那就更好了","Every time I go to Hangzhou to travel a business trip, I live, and the face is hard. If you can drop it on the grid, it will be better."
1,虽然房间陈旧，地毯比较赃，可是考虑价格和星级，就可以接受吧。早餐有很多菜，味道还行，让我满足了。下次还会住在这宾馆。,"Although the room is old and the carpet is relatively stolen, you can accept the price and star rating.There are a lot of dishes for breakfast, and the taste is okay, so that I can satisfy me.I will stay in this hotel next time."
1,酒店去开发区比较方便，离市区比较远。酒店的服务和设施都很不错。超级可爱的是卫生间的电控马桶，尽管没有烘干功能，中国人也还可以用其他功能，老外就不敢用了，因为标示均为中文字。一楼的日本餐厅味道一流，赞~~不知为什么生意不怎么样。总体来说，这家酒店非常不错，公司的老外相当满意。宾馆反馈2008年1月9日：您好！谨代表银帆天之川日餐厅的全体同仁表示感谢！银帆的电控马桶安装使用之后，深受广大客人的喜爱！而外籍客人尤其是日本客人由于本国已经普遍使用这种新型技术，因此可以比较熟练的使用。银帆的日餐厅于2008年1月10日开始正式装修结束，投入营业，目前庞大的广告宣传正在展开，相信我们的未来会更好！,"It is more convenient to go to the development zone and far from the urban area.The hotel's services and facilities are very good.The super cute is the toilet toilet in the bathroom. Although there is no drying function, the Chinese can also use other functions. Foreigners dare not use it because the labels are Chinese characters.The Japanese restaurant on the first floor tastes first, praise ~~ I don't know why the business is not good.In general, the hotel is very good, and the company's foreigners are quite satisfied.Hotel feedback on January 9, 2008: Hello!I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of all colleagues of Yinfantian's Sichuan Restaurant!After the use of Yinfan's electronic control toilet installation and use, it is loved by the majority of guests!Foreign guests, especially Japanese guests, can be used more proficiently because their own country has generally used this new technology.Yinfan's Japanese dining room was officially renovated on January 10, 2008, and it was put into business. At present, the huge advertising promotion is unfolding. I believe our future will be better!"
1,本来预定普通标间，到前台才知道没有房间了，故此升级到携程上没有的豪华大床房，房间不大但很干净，我很满意。酒店斜对面是家专卖俄罗斯商品的商店，延路一直走没几步就可以到江边，景色还不错，如果下次出差还会住这里。,"Originally scheduled to be a normal standard room, I did n’t know that there was no room at the front desk. Therefore, it was upgraded to a luxurious large bed room that was not on Ctrip. The room was not large but clean. I was very satisfied.On the opposite side of the hotel is a store specializing in Russian goods. Yan Lu can always go to the river a few steps. The scenery is good. If you go on a business trip next time, you will live here."
1,大床房很舒服的。呵呵。不错。不错。在广东算干净的酒店了。服务员也很好态度。感觉很好，只是没有早餐吃，很不爽。,"The big bed room is very comfortable.hehe.good.good.A clean hotel in Guangdong.The waiter is also very good.It feels very good, but it is unhappy without breakfast."
1,很超值的酒店，对得起这个价格，但是上网步骤比较麻烦，网速一般。,"Valted hotels are worthy of this price, but the Internet steps are more troublesome and the Internet speed is average."
1,"性价比特高,值得推荐.有机会到深圳我还会订该酒店",High cost -effective Bit is worth recommending. I have the opportunity to go to Shenzhen. I will bind the hotel
1,入住时酒店的低层部分仍在翻新装修，我住的是已完成装修的高层。房间相当干净、舒适、房间和卫生间的设施看得出来都是高档品牌。周围环境也很好，旁边有万佳百货，出酒店往西（右）步行约20分钟就到了福田区的购物中心华强北路。前台直接预订的话要348元。下次无论是自己去深圳还是朋友去，都会推荐这个酒店！,"The low -level part of the hotel is still renovating and renovation when I check in. I live in high -level renovation.The rooms are quite clean, comfortable, and the facilities in the room and toilet can see that they are high -end brands.The surrounding environment is also very good. There are Wanjia Department Stores next to it. For about 20 minutes to walk west (right), you will go to Huaqiang North Road in the shopping mall in Futian District.It takes 348 yuan if the front desk is booked directly.Whether you go to Shenzhen or friends next time, you will recommend this hotel!"
1,"夏日商务套房的价格780,稍高了一些.如果是平时的600多,还合理.但总的来说,比起哈尔滨的华旗,华融等所谓的四星级酒店的套房,房间的色调及配置,还说得过去,面积不大不小,45平米.哈尔滨除了香格里拉,但房间又太小,在江边的凯莱花园酒店不错,开发区的福顺天天还可以,余下的就数金谷了.但它新装修的房间虽然很现代,但味道太大,否则,应该让它排到第二位.","The price of summer business suite is 780, which is slightly higher. If it is more than 600, it is reasonable. But in general, compared to the so -called four -star hotels such as Harbin, Huarong, etc.The color and configuration, it is also said, the area is not small, 45 square meters. In addition to Shangri -La, the room is too small.It. However, although its newly renovated room is very modern, it tastes too big, otherwise, it should be ranked second."
1,"我于1月31日入住该酒店,其硬件设施尚可,但客房服务员细致周到,主动为客人准备好冰糖梨汁,因为观察到客人的喉咙不适,该酒店的客房服务是我","I stayed at the hotel on January 31st. Its hardware facilities were acceptable, but the guest room waiters were meticulous and thoughtful, and took the initiative to prepare rock sugar pear juice for the guests, because observing the guest's throat discomfort, the hotel's guest room service was me"
1,在装修，走到沙滩要饶一大圈，除此之外还不错，不过对秦皇岛的海比较失望，住海边没什么意思,"On the decoration, you have to make a big circle when you walk to the beach. It is not bad, but it is more disappointed with the sea of Qinhuangdao."
1,我入住的是标间，房间设施比较老。对面的海景房，正对着大海。夏天的时候去住，肯定很爽。不过，价格不会像现在淡季这么便宜了。另外，就酒店的宽带速率好像比较慢，是网通的。另外，通过商务中心订不到上海的火车票，后来我自己打车去预售点，竟然买到了。建议商务中心，还是要多手准备啊。,"I stay in the standard room, and the room facilities are older.The sea view room opposite is facing the sea.To live in summer, it must be very cool.However, the price will not be as cheap as the off -season now.In addition, the broadband rate of the hotel seems to be slower, which is Netcom.In addition, the train ticket was not booked through the business center. Later, I took a taxi to the pre -sale point and bought it.It is recommended that the business center, still prepare more hands."
1,"房间很一般，但服务员态度还不错。不过听说韶山还有比这个更好的酒店，但携程没有。免费注册网站导航宾馆索引服务说明关于携程诚聘英才代理合作广告业务联系我们Copyright1999-2008,ctrip.com.allrightsreserved.","The room is very average, but the waiter's attitude is not bad.But I heard that Shaoshan still has a better hotel than this, but Ctrip does not.Free registered website navigation hotel index service description About Ctrip, the advertising business of Ctrip, contact us Copyright1999-2008, ctrip.com.allrightsReserved."
1,总体来说还可以就是房间隔音效果差了点晚上休息的时候走廊有人经过都能听的清楚的很而且整晚走廊都有人经过,"Overall, it can also be that the room sound insulation effect is bad. Some people can hear the corridor clearly when the corridor can be heard at night."
1,感觉很好，客房管家的留言很温馨，下次到石家庄的话，还会选择这里宾馆反馈2008年8月4日：感谢您对国宾大酒店的认可。我们期待您的再次光临！祝工作生活一切顺利！,"It feels very good. The message of the guest housekeeper is very warm. If you arrive at Shijiazhuang next time, you will also choose the hotel here to feedback August 4, 2008: Thank you for your recognition of the National Bin Hotel.We look forward to your visit again!I wish all the work and life go well!"
1,"刚刚结束为期一周的旅游,在该酒店住了两天,房间的整体设施感觉非常不错,特别是在本人入住期间,迷你吧的食物可以尽情享用,感觉非常好!但唯有一点,需要提及一下,在酒店描述中有机场往来穿梭巴士这一条不太符合情况.事实上,根本没有机场穿梭巴士,倒是有到关闸的往来巴士.这一点感觉上不是很好!所以希望后面的旅客千万注意!机场没有该酒店的穿梭巴士,只能乘公共巴士及出租!出租费用我们过去,由于有行李,打表为57澳元(我们付的港币),实际上收了87澳元(据说,一件行李10澳,搞不懂,完全图个舒心了!","Just ended a week of tourism, I lived in the hotel for two days. The overall facilities in the room felt very good, especially during my staying in, the food of mini can be enjoyed, it feels very good! But only one thing, you need to mention it, you need to mention it, you need to mention it, you need to mention it, you need to mention it, you need to mention it, you need to mention it.First, the shuttle bus shuttles buses in the hotel description are not in line with the situation. In fact, there is no airport shuttle bus at all, but there are buses that go to the gate.Note! There is no shuttle bus at the hotel at the airport, and we can only take public buses and rental! The rental fee is over. Because there is luggage, the watch is $ 57 (the Hong Kong dollars we pay).10 Australian luggage, I do n’t understand, it ’s so comfortable!"
1,这间酒店是在澳门中心地带（我觉得是中心啦），属于经济实惠的1100港币，就在银河对面，走路2分钟就到永利，新葡京，虽然房间有点旧了，不过大大的浴室让你感觉还算ok。法老王赌场相对有不是那么挤，住过几间不同的酒店，这间给我感觉还是挺方便蛮实惠的。你真的要享受舒适的房间，住到永利的标房2500或是银河的行政VIP房2000，也是值的一试。,"This hotel is in the center of Macau (I think it is a center). It belongs to the economic affordable 1100 Hong Kong dollars. It is opposite the Galaxy and walks 2 minutes to Wynn. Although the room is a bit old, the large bathroom allowsYou feel OK.The Pharaoh King Casino is relatively squeezing. I have lived in a few different hotels. This is still very convenient and affordable for me.You really have to enjoy a comfortable room, live in Wynn's standard room 2500 or the administrative VIP room 2000 in the Galaxy, which is also a trial."
1,在石家庄住过世纪、国际大厦，后来住国宾。感觉不错：房间宽敞，设施还可以。每晚有水果送。早餐比较丰富。只是checkinandcheckout慢一些，还要提高。宾馆反馈2008年7月31日：感谢您对国宾大酒店的认可。正值奥运期间，登记手续比较繁锁，我们正在研究工作细节，尽量简化登记手续，期待您再次光临，并对我们的工作提出宝贵建议！祝生活愉快，一切顺利！,"Living in Shijiazhuang for century, international building, and later lived.It feels good: the room is spacious, and the facilities are okay.Send fruit every night.Breakfast is richer.It's just that CHECKINANDCHECKOUT is slower, and it must be improved.Hotel feedback on July 31, 2008: Thank you for your recognition of the State Hotel.During the Olympic Games, the registration procedures are relatively locked. We are studying the details of the work, trying to simplify the registration procedures, and look forward to your visit again, and make precious suggestions for our work!I wish life a happy life and everything goes well!"
1,酒店太旧了，价格偏高，所谓送的三餐没有什么优势可言，总要出门办事，不可能天天跑回酒店去吃中餐和晚餐,The hotel is too old and the price is high. There is no advantage in the so -called three meals. It is always necessary to go out to work. It is impossible to run back to the hotel every day to eat Chinese food and dinner.
1,"内容：其实对这次的预订,对携程的回复是非常不满意,因为我要求将退房时间延迟至下午二点.(有特殊原因)但携程从头到尾都没有帮我解决,或是将时间稍微延后些.酒店方倒是比较好,我说明了一下我要延迟的原因后,前台服务人员同意延后半小时.虽然仅仅是半个小时的时间,但这让我的入住情绪稍有了好转.一样是人与人之间的沟通,为什么结果却截然不同!!!","Content: In fact, for this reservation, the reply to Ctrip is very dissatisfied, because I asked to delay the check -out time until 2 pm. (There are special reasons), but Ctrip did not help me solve it from beginning to end, or I will be able to help me solve it, or I will be able to solveThe time is slightly delayed. The hotel side is better. I explained that after the reason I want to delay, the front desk service staff agreed to delay for half an hour. Although it was only half an hour, this made my check -in emotion a little bit.I improved. The same is the communication between people, but why the result is completely different !!!"
1,我从05年开始入住该酒店，每次来南通，基本上都是住在该酒店，总体来说，酒店所处位置方便，旁边就是银行，有大润发超市，如果没事，还可以到超市转转，前台的服务不错，效率也挺高，每次都会面带微笑向客人问好，缺点是有些房间的门有点松，需要重新装一下，毕竟出门在外，安全是第一位的，希望能改进。,"I have been in the hotel since 2005. Every time I come to Nantong, I basically live in the hotel. Generally speaking, the hotel is convenient. It is a bank next to it.The front desk service is good and the efficiency is very high. Every time I meet with a smile, I ask the guests. The disadvantage is that the door of some rooms is a bit loose and needs to be re -installed. After all, the safety is the first place. I hope to improve it."
1,"没有早餐,非常不方便.另外,对于在携程上点评后,酒店方有小礼品赠品,事先并不知道,是在结帐时看到前台有这样的标牌.能否有人提醒一下.","There is no breakfast, which is very inconvenient. In addition, after the review on Ctrip, the hotel has a small gift gift. I do n’t know in advance. I saw such signs at the front desk at the checkout. Can someone remind?"
1,酒店设施一般，但当客人入住后，服务员主动送来报纸和水果，服务很周到。发现洗手间内没有牙具，电话前台马上就送过来了。大床房间的床很舒服。,"The hotel facilities are average, but when the guests move in, the waiter takes the initiative to send newspapers and fruits, and the service is very thoughtful.It was found that there were no dental tools in the bathroom, and the front desk of the phone came immediately.The bed in the big bed is very comfortable."
1,酒店很干净，服务不错，所以决定今晚再次来入住。宾馆反馈2008年7月31日：感谢您多次选择国宾大酒店入住，并对酒店予以认可。我们将一如即往，以优质的服务，热情的微笑期待您的再次光临！,"The hotel is very clean and the service is good, so I decided to stay in again tonight.Hotel feedback on July 31, 2008: Thank you for choosing the National Bin Hotel to check in many times and recognized the hotel.We will go as soon as possible, with high -quality services, enthusiastic smiles looking forward to your visit again!"
1,刚从东莞回来，我觉得那里虽然有点偏，旁边不是很繁华，但是总体来说酒店还是可以的，房间很大，床也很大，酒店的海鲜虽然有点贵但是味道很不错。,"I just came back from Dongguan. I think although it is a bit biased and not very prosperous next to it, but in general, the hotel is still okay. The room is large and the bed is very large. Although the hotel's seafood is a bit expensive, it tastes very good."
1,整体不错，位置也方便，上网速度快。出门向右（东南西北分不清），数分钟，一步行街，吃很方便，生力啤酒6.00一瓶，两人吃，点三个菜应该足够。用餐时，还会有路边歌手献唱，当然唱前要钱的。酒店LOBBY在三楼，听说一楼的海鲜酒家在当地很有名，主要是会做鲍鱼和鱼翅。本人抠门儿，没有尝鲜。另外酒店的早餐很好。不过有一点极其极其差：由于我们延住一天，一定要用信用卡再预授权一次（本人认为多余，因为是国际卡，本身账户里是没钱的，与国内卡有一定差别），奇怪的在离店付费时，一定要刷两次卡，告之因为预授权了两次，付费时也要两次，我问：“是不是如果我延住十次，就要预授权十次，然后付费再刷卡十次？不怕信用卡被锁住？”答：“是的，我们也没法儿，酒店一直这么操作，领导要求这样”。我晕。关于这点儿，我相信与前台的服务人员无关，是酒店管理的问题。相比在宁波多数酒店国际卡预授权只需1.00元人民币的作法，有很大差距。,"The overall is good, the position is also convenient, and the Internet speed is fast.Going out to the right (unclear southeast and northwest), a few minutes, one step on the street, it is very convenient to eat. Shengli beer 6.00 bottle, two people eat, or order three dishes.During the meal, there will also be a roadside singer singing, of course, the money is required before singing.The hotel Lobby is on the third floor. I heard that the seafood restaurants on the first floor are very famous in the local area, mainly as abalone and shark fin.I have a tip, and I have no early adopters.In addition, the hotel's breakfast is very good.However, there is one extremely poor point: because we delay for a day, we must use a credit card to be pre -authorized again (I think it is redundant, because it is an international card, and there is no money in its own account, which is different from the domestic card).When paying for the store, be sure to swipe twice. It is told because of pre -authorization twice, and you have to pay twice when paid. I asked: ""If I extend ten times, I must pre -authorize it ten times, and then paySwipe your card ten times? Are you afraid that the credit card is locked? ""Answer:"" Yes, we can't, the hotel has been operating like this, and the leader requires this. ""I am dizzy.Regarding this, I believe that it has nothing to do with the service staff at the front desk. It is a problem with hotel management.Compared with the practice of only 1.00 yuan in Ningbo's major hotel international card authorization, there is a big gap."
1,地理位置好，离河边不远，我们中秋期间区的，河边有灯会，夜景很美。酒店房间不错，只是周围餐馆难找，我们走了很远，找到一家特色铁板锅，忘记叫什么名字了，很实惠，又好吃。,"The geographical location is good, not far from the river. During the Mid -Autumn Festival, there are lantern festivals by the river. The night view is beautiful.The hotel room is good, but it is difficult to find the surrounding restaurants. We have gone far away. We found a special iron plate pot. I forgot what the name is. It is very affordable and delicious."
1,"酒店的地理环境还是不错的,在沂河边,,天气好的话,河景房可以看到河流.此次因为天气冷,又有大雾,所以两天的用餐都在酒店5楼的餐厅,,菜不错,,价格也适中.美中不足的是酒店大堂的各种活动太多,,房产销售,,结婚的,,公司开业的,,全来,乱轰轰的,,太吵.","The geographical environment of the hotel is still good. By the Yiyi River, if the weather is good, the river view room can see the river. This time because the weather is cold and there is a big fog, two days of dining in the restaurant on the 5th floor of the hotel.The dishes are good, and the price is also moderate. The lack of beauty is that there are too many activities in the hotel lobby. Real estate sales, marriage, the company's opening, the company, all, the bombardment, too noisy."
1,"我住的商务大床房,房号607的那间洗澡后厕所会积水,好几次差点摔倒","I live in a large business bed room, and the toilet will accumulate water after bathing with 607 room number 607. I almost fell several times."
1,"1.更改订房造成房费增加并未告知2.未询问是否以现金方式结算,取消信用卡预授权后,又直接再刷卡结算,前台人员素质有待加强!","1. The increase in the increase in the reservation and the increase in the increase in the housing fee is not informed. 2. It is not asked if it is settled in cash. After the credit card is pre -authorized, you can directly swipe the card to settle it. The quality of the front desk personnel needs to be strengthened!"
1,的确很靠近火车站及汽车北站，走路不超过15分钟。房间里摆放了3本推荐的新书，其中一本是童话双语的，感觉很好。不知道为什么房间里不备电话簿。,"It is really close to the train station and the north station of the car, and walking does not exceed 15 minutes.There are three recommended new books in the room, one of which is a fairy tale bilingual, which feels good.I don't know why there is no phone book in the room."
1,"地理位置很不错,交通方便,我住的是迎宾楼,房间很干净,就是小了点,节假日要想在此酒店喝早茶,可能要提前预订,我入住时是国庆时期,早上7点一刻下去已经全部桌子都被霸了,可是每桌都是坐一两个老人家..","The geographical location is very good and the transportation is convenient. I live in the welcome building. The room is very clean. It is a little small. If you want to drink early tea at this hotel on holidays, you may have to book in advance.All the tables have been dominated, but each table is sitting on one or two elderly people .."
1,这是我在新会住过的最好的酒店，平均一个半月住一次，推荐大家入住；虽然含早餐，不过推荐推荐在旁边的餐厅喝早茶，味道不错！,"This is the best hotel I have lived in the Xinhui. I live in an average of one and a half months. I recommend everyone to stay; although I contain breakfast, it is recommended to drink morning tea in the restaurant next to it. It tastes good!"
1,"整体环境比较不错,离景点也很近,很方便.适合家庭旅游居住","The overall environment is relatively good, it is very close to the attractions, which is very convenient. Suitable for family tourism living"
1,"东楼挂2星或准3星合适.房间内卫生间设施差,且面积太小,卫生尚可.饭菜价格能接受,用餐环境好.饭店周边环境好.住店客人可免费游僧冠峰,魁星楼也不过几分钟的路.","East building is suitable for 2 stars or quasi -3 stars. The bathroom facilities in the room are poor, and the area is too small. The price of food is acceptable. The food price is good. The surrounding environment of the restaurant is good.Kui Xinglou is only a few minutes."
1,酒店房间确实是干净，没问题，就是要仔细看这个水是偏黄的，热水保持的时间不是很长，住在顶搂的房间，当天正好没有很多的客人，晚上开房门想看看走廊的设施的，结果一看，估计一个搂面就我一个房间有人，十分的可怕，太安静了，安静的我没想法了，酒店里的MINI吧～～看看是几几年的？2年多了还放着，真节约，太节约了，总体感觉不错的，值得一住，但是里面细节做的细致的话，我会经常去的～～,"The hotel room is really clean. There is no problem. It is to take a closer look at the yellow water. The hot water is not long. Living in the top room, there are no many guests that day.At the beginning of the corridor, at first glance, it is estimated that there is someone in my room in one room. It is very terrible. It is too quiet. I have no idea. How many years are it?It ’s more than 2 years, it’ s really savvy, too conservative, it feels good in general, it is worth living, but if the details are done in detail, I will go often ~~"
1,位置离市区比较远。除了环境好以外，哪里都不象五星级酒店。房间还不错，空间很大，但感觉设施一般，前台服务员的形象更是差，头发凌乱，有一人嘴角还长着口疮……自助早餐也不象五星级酒店,"The location is far from the urban area.Except for the good environment, it is not like a five -star hotel.The room is not bad, the space is very large, but the facilities feel average, the image of the front desk waiter is even worse, the hair is messy, and one person has a sore in the corner of the mouth ... The buffet breakfast is not like a five -star hotel"
1,酒店内部及周边环境非常好，是长期居住在城市的人们度假休闲的好去处，酒店在节日期间还退出一些怀旧游乐和小吃，很能烘托节日气氛，周边的同升湖的延湖别墅也是别有风景，还有专为,"The interior and surrounding environment of the hotel is very good. It is a good place for people who live in cities for a long time. During the festival, some nostalgia and snacks can be exited during the festival.There are scenery, and there are specifically"
1,盥洗室的设计理念落后，面积大没有利用起来，地砖铺设没有坡度，洗澡容易造成地下积水。各种一次用品质地较高档。大堂服务也很好，比赛结束后守在门口把我们从武警守护圈外领进去，男足也住这家酒店。,"The design concept of the washing room is backward, and the area is not used. There is no slope laying on floor tiles. Bathing can easily cause underground water.Various one -time quality texture.The lobby service is also very good. After the game, we stayed at the door and led us from the guardian circle of the Armed Police. The men's football team also lived in this hotel."
1,服务很棒，价格也不高，周围的环境也很不错,"The service is great, the price is not high, and the surrounding environment is also very good"
1,"交通位置很好,服务设施还可以.但价格有点高,可能太原的酒店价格普通比较高的原因吧!","The transportation location is very good, the service facilities are okay. But the price is a bit high. Maybe the price of the hotel in Taiyuan is generally higher!"
1,不错的酒店~~相当的安静~~,Good hotel ~~ quite quiet ~~
1,"贵宾楼又经过了改造,入住更舒适了,以前只有3个楼面现在有了5个,感觉房间更大了一些.最有特色的还是所处位置的安静,房间隔音还马马虎虎,夜里能听到隔壁的电话声音.但是作为一家五星酒店,怎么可以容忍美容美发部门对客人每天一次的电话骚扰呢?","The VIP Tower has been transformed again, and it is more comfortable to check in. There were only 5 floors in the past. I felt that the room was larger. The most distinctive thing was the quietness of the location.To the sound of the phone next door. But as a five -star hotel, how can we tolerate the harassment of the beauty and hairdressing department once a day?"
1,服务态度一般；房间隔音效果不好，总能听到隔壁房间的声音，特别是鸡上门的声音很明显，严重影响休息。,"The service attitude is average; the sound insulation effect of the room is not good. You can always hear the sound of the room next door, especially the sound of the chicken door is obvious, which seriously affects the rest."
1,整感是不的但是我已入住3次了酒店有基本息可是不清楚我的基本料是非常可惜的因未能有客有回家的感,"The whole feeling is not, but I have been staying in 3 times that the hotel has basic interest, but it is unclear that my basic material is very unfortunately because there is no guest feelings to go home."
1,价格比去年高了，例如去年含早餐的房价，今年早餐取消了，但价格不变。性价比降低了，一直以来经常住这家酒店，偶尔住万豪，不过上次来重庆住万豪，感觉不错，再考虑到金源性价比的降低，以后准备挪窝了。这次没有住到大床房，住的是标准间，床真的很不舒服，也算我决定挪窝的原因之一吧。,"The price is higher than last year. For example, the house price contained in breakfast last year was canceled this year, but the price remains unchanged.The cost -effectiveness has been reduced. I have always lived in this hotel and occasionally live in Marriott. However, I came to Chongqing to live in Marriott in Chongqing last time. It feels good. Considering the reduction of the cost -effectiveness of Jinyuan, I am ready to move.I did n’t live in a large bed room this time. I lived in a standard room. The bed was really uncomfortable. It was one of the reasons I decided to move."
1,唉！每年都会住几次这家酒店，这次总的来说服务还是不错，就是酒店旧了,"well!This hotel will stay several times a year. This time, the service is still good, that is, the hotel is old."
1,每年都在这住1-2次，房间日益陈旧，缺乏维护，地毯和浴室越来越脏猪肉涨价？早餐越来越差结账的时侯在前台等查房期间，听到其它同志付的房费都比我略低，看来携程的渠道在长沙不算好,"Live here 1-2 times every year. The room is increasingly old and lacks maintenance. The carpets and bathrooms are getting dirty pork prices?When the breakfast is getting worse and worse, during the time in the front desk and other rounds, I hear other comrades paid the house fee is slightly lower than me. It seems that Ctrip's channels are not good in Changsha."
1,"套间的附近就是卡拉OK的地点，比较吵闹，定过一次就不想再订了，希望可以进行以下调整不要影响客人休息下一页>>免费注册网站导航宾馆索引服务说明关于携程诚聘英才代理合作广告业务联系我们Copyright1999-2008,ctrip.com.allrightsreserved.","Near the suite is the location of the karaoke. It is more noisy. After the decision, I do n’t want to order anymore. I hope that the following adjustments can not affect the guest rest.The advertising business contacts us Copyright1999-2008, ctrip.com.allrightsReserved."
1,在推行环保方面做得比较到位，而且在菱湖公园旁边，环境不错。总体来说还可以，就是房间稍微偏小一点。,"It is relatively well -implemented in implementing environmental protection, and next to Linghu Park, the environment is good.Overall, the room is slightly smaller."
1,"比较而言,还是这家酒店暖气好一些.地理位置不错,闹中取静,办事很方便,早餐教丰富,在安庆应该知足了,哈哈.不过贵宾楼住宿还要好一点,当然如果愿意多付方0元的话(比主楼贵一点.","In comparison, this hotel is better in heating. The geographical location is good, the noise is quiet, the business is very convenient, the breakfast is rich, and it should be content in Anqing, haha.If it is 0 yuan (a little more expensive than the main building."
1,"因为地震原因客人不多,可是价格已经回调到很高,觉得实在不必要.不过各方面服务都是很不错的,还是比较满意.是不是继续入住,要看以后是不是还这么贵了.","There are not many guests because of the earthquake, but the price is already high, and it is unnecessary. However, the services in all aspects are very good, or they are more satisfied. Do you continue to check in? It depends on whether it will be so expensive in the future."
1,优点：1、硬件非常新。2、洗漱用品齐全。3、早餐不错。4、位置在人南立交桥，属于南二环，距离机场非常近，打车20分钟肯定到了，35元左右。缺点：1、电源插座位置很隐蔽，不方便使用。2、前台服务员英语水平太低，不了解KrisFlyer积分计划，浪费了我的时间。3、周边的购物场所不多。,"Advantages: 1. The hardware is very new.2. Wash the supplies complete.3. Breakfast is good.4. Location is on the south of the south, which belongs to the South Second Ring Road, which is very close to the airport. It must be about 35 yuan for 20 minutes.Disadvantages: 1. The position of the power socket is very hidden and it is not convenient to use.2. The level of English at the front desk is too low. I do n’t know the Krisflyer points plan, which is a waste of my time.3. There are not many shopping venues around."
1,这次入住非常仓促，但是印象深刻。房间设施很新，卫生间和床铺非常干净。家人都很喜欢。,"This time I was very hasty, but I was impressed.The room facilities are new, and the bathroom and bed are very clean.The family likes it very much."
1,不知为何，成都的凯宾斯基饭店确实不能够与其他凯宾斯基饭店相提并论，硬件倒说不出有什么不妥，但软件却不敢恭维。checkin的时候，信用卡被他们告知有问题，居然是余额不足（这是绝对不可能发生的，应该是饭店的网络出了问题），好不容易在银行工作人员的协助下解决了。Checkout的时候，居然说我用了小吧台的物品，查来查去，又被告知是前一位客人使用的，记在我名下。所以，建议朋友们，如果对服务要求比较高，可能不是最佳选择。另外，这个酒店无论哪个房间，都比较吵。,"Somehow, the Kaipinki Hotel in Chengdu can indeed be compared with other Kimbinsky Hotel. The hardware cannot say that there is anything wrong, but the software dare not compliment.When checkin, the credit card was informed that there was a problem, but the balance was insufficient (this is absolutely impossible, it should be that there was a problem with the hotel's network), and it was difficult to resolve it with the assistance of the bank staff.When checkout, I actually said that I used the items of the small bar, checked it, and was told that it was used by the previous guest and recorded it under my name.Therefore, it is recommended that friends, if the service requirements are relatively high, may not be the best choice.In addition, no matter which room this hotel is, it is more noisy."
1,"酒店的环境不算很好,但房间够大,洗手间感觉舒服,整体感觉可以.","The environment of the hotel is not very good, but the room is large enough, the bathroom feels comfortable, the overall feeling is OK."
1,我们住的是四室一厅的小牧屋，已经第二次去了，感觉挺好的，很适合人数较多的度假活动。周边有大学城，吃饭问题也可以解决了。一定还会去。但是卫生设施不是很方便。用的是电热水器，洗个澡5分钟不到水就冷了。电视机只能收到3、4个台。不过那么多人本来就是去玩的，这个就忽略不计了。。。,"We live in the small pastoral house in four rooms and one living room. It has been for the second time. It feels good and it is very suitable for vacation activities with a large number of people.There are university cities around, and the problem of eating can be solved.Will definitely go.But sanitary facilities are not very convenient.The electric water heater is used, and it will be cold in less than 5 minutes to take a bath.The TV can only receive 3 or 4 units.However, so many people are just playing, and this is ignored.EssenceEssence"
1,"酒店的checkin和checkout很快.预订的普通单人间没有了免费升到了商务单人单,不错,房间内的电脑网速也是很快.就是地毯老了点.可以就是A幢和B幢的区别吧.早餐也还可以吧.总体来讲性价比挺高.下次还会选择.","The hotel's Checkin and Checkout are fast. The ordinary single room reserved has no free rising to a business single, yes, the computer network speed in the room is also very fast.Bar. Breakfast is okay. Generally speaking, the price is very high. I will choose next time."
1,价格确实比较高，而且还没有早餐提供。携程拿到的价格不好？还是自己保留起来不愿意让利给我们这些客户呢？到前台搞价格，430就可以了。,"The price is indeed high and there is no breakfast.The price gets bad?Or is it unwilling to give us good to us customers?Go to the front desk for the price, 430."
1,携程的价格和酒店前台的价格一样。第一天到酒店后没有水果，第二天没有通过携程直接在前台开了一个标间，天天都有水果赠送。早餐还可以，品种够多。晚上没有骚扰电话，但是你如果想被骚扰，可以给按摩中心打电话让人上门按摩。房间内的装修还可以，只是窗户的玻璃与窗框居然有很大的缝隙。总体感觉还是不错，不到三百块钱的价格还可以。,"Ctrip's price is the same as the price of the hotel's front desk.There was no fruit after arriving at the hotel on the first day. The next day, I did not pass Ctrip to open a standard room directly on the front desk.Breakfast is okay, there are enough varieties.There is no harassment call at night, but if you want to be harassed, you can call the massage center for people to massage.The decoration in the room is okay, but the glass and the window frame of the window have a large gap.The overall feeling is still good, the price of less than 300 yuan is okay."
1,环境还不错，不论前台、客房、餐饮，各方服务都不错。,"The environment is not bad. Regardless of the front desk, guest rooms, catering, all parties have good services."
1,房间4分设施齐备房间大而舒适某些破旧的地方没有修补；环境5分酒店离大马路有段距离晚上几乎听不到噪音地处沙面环境方面在广州能给5分了；服务3分服务印象中规中矩。评定4分另外：可以免费停车但是停车位置过于拥挤；标间3个月前296元现在31X元价钱还算在合理范围但是涨价是不是也需要理由呢,"The 4 -point room facilities have a large and comfortable place in the room without repair; the environment 5 points for the environment can hardly hear the noise in the evening at the evening.The service impression is quite satisfactory.Evaluation 4 points. In addition: you can park free but the parking position is too crowded; the price of 31X for 31X 31X is now in a reasonable range, but it is also necessary to increase the price."
1,周边的环境确实不错，适合度假旅游，就是交通不是很方便。,"The surrounding environment is really good, suitable for vacation travel, that is, transportation is not very convenient."
1,整洁舒适的小酒店。酒店周边环境可给5分了！而且每天进出酒店都可在门前花园里碰到数对新人在拍婚纱照。。。。,"Tidy and comfortable small hotel.The surrounding environment of the hotel can give 5 points!And every day in the hotel, you can encounter several pairs of newcomers in front of the garden in front of the door.EssenceEssenceEssence"
1,离珠江夜游的码头很近，所以对旅游者来说是个不错的选择，周边环境也很好，很安静。房间比较宽敞，下次会再选择入住。,"The dock from the Pearl River Night Tour is very close, so it is a good choice for tourists. The surrounding environment is also very good and quiet.The room is relatively spacious, and I will choose to check in next time."
1,酒店服务很好，床很舒服，也许是比较喜欢西餐的原因，个人比较喜欢万豪的早餐，交通方便，因为去香港两天都在下雨，显得尤为重要，楼下通太古广场和地铁，大半时间都在太古逛了，还顺便看了一场电影，从LG去地铁站坐地铁去尖沙咀和湾仔都只有一站，铜锣湾只有两站，以后再去还会考虑住这里,"The hotel service is very good and the bed is very comfortable. Perhaps it is the reason why Western food prefers. Personally prefer Marriott's breakfast. It is convenient for transportation because it is raining in Hong Kong for two days. It seems particularly important.They are all walking around. I also watched a movie by the way. From LG to the subway station, there are only one stop to Tsim Sha Tsui and Wan Chai. There are only two stations in Causeway Bay. I will consider living here in the future."
1,住在二十三层，两面落地大玻璃，一面山景，一面海景，景观十分美丽！还有自动窗帘，很方便。每天有免费水果（2橙子、2蛇果、1香蕉），还有巧克力2小块。交通十分便利，不用到户外就可以乘地铁，逛商场。早餐有打包的专用纸袋，真的很不错！,"Living on the twenty -three floors, large glass on both sides, a mountain view, a sea view, the landscape is very beautiful!There is also automatic curtains, which is very convenient.There are free fruits (2 orange, 2 snake fruit, 1 banana), and 2 small pieces of chocolate.The transportation is very convenient. You can take the subway without going outdoors and visit the mall.There are special paper bags for breakfast, which is really good!"
1,香港万豪充满了香港特色，寸土寸金，所以房间很小，但却很精致，体贴细致的服务，让人处处感受到香港人的素质和效率，优点就如前面所有点评一样，不再赘述，唯有一点点小的缺点，望万豪可以改进，作为五星级酒店，以往可能欧美的商务客人居多，所以1、酒店用品标识全为英文，2、餐饮方面中菜太少，口味不正，随着近年内地游客增多，万豪会有越来越多的内地客人，希望能够在以上两个方面多为内地客人考虑，做些改进。,"Hong Kong Marriott is full of Hong Kong characteristics and has gold and gold, so the room is very small, but it is very delicate and considerate. It makes people feel the quality and efficiency of Hong Kong people everywhere.There is only a little shortcoming, hoping that Marriott can be improved. As a five -star hotel, most business guests may be in Europe and the United States in the past, so 1. Hotel supplies are all English.With the increase in mainland tourists in recent years, there will be more and more Mainland guests in Marriott. I hope that most of the above two areas can consider and make some improvements for mainland guests."
1,"房间别致,有特色。环境一流。因为是木屋隔音很差。补充点评2008年2月29日：最好选2楼(木屋隔音太差).我住在2楼,稍微动动.一楼就打电话说我们声音太吵了.","The room is unique and distinctive.The environment is first -rate.Because the wooden house sounds poorly.Supplementary comment on February 29, 2008: It is best to choose the second floor (the sound insulation of the wooden house is too poor). I live on the second floor and move a little. The first floor called and said that our voice was too noisy."
1,酒店整体很好，房很干净整齐，员工很有礼貌，就连其它的住客都显得很斯文有礼，值得给予五星的评级。只是酒店太远离市区，附近很荒凉，主要走道西湖路的两旁都只是小型的工业材料店、工具商店、工厂和政府机关、学校，到下午六时后就静悄悄的显得很沧凉，夜行时心里有点慌治安，更不要说江畔的另一条主要走道，更是缈无人影，酒店却没有免费接送车，的士也不好找，晚上饿起来就只能光顾酒店的中西餐，或打的士到旧城区去，再晚一点就只能捱饿。酒店房间的隔音也不好，房外或楼上楼下其它住客开关门的声音都很显，早上时服务员执拾房间也造成很大噪音，弄得我两个晚上加两个早上都睡得不好，常被惊醒。还有一点建议，我离退当天刚好遇上大雨，我出门时天气良好没有带伞，可是当时雨下得大，酒店偏远四周都没有的士可找，我只能拉住保安员让他用他的雨伞挡雨带我走去数十米外的巴士站等车，到了火车站又被淋得浑身湿透，冷得抖震，其实酒店可以向厂家订购一些廉价短雨伞送给遇雨没伞的住客，成本不高只每柄几元矣，但酒店给住客的心意却可以让他们久不能忘，当作广告赠品也很化算……补充点评2008年1月29日：酒店对面有个工地是数栋高级豪宅的屋苑，可能会在年中入伙，那时可能会有食肆或小商店超市等，我会考虑在这个屋苑入伙后再住的…..但这段时间，还是住回旧城区算了。,"The hotel is very good as a whole, the room is very clean and neat, and the employees are very polite. Even other residents are very polite and worthy of five -star rating.It's just that the hotel is too far away from the urban area, and it is very desolate nearby. The main sides of the West Lake Road are just small industrial material shops, tool shops, factories and government agencies, and schools.When I was a little panicked in my heart, let alone another main aisle on the river bank. It was unmanned, but the hotel did not pick up and dropped the car for free.When you go to the old city, you can only starve to the old city.The sound insulation in the hotel room is not good. The sounds of other residents outside the room or upstairs and downstairs are very clear. In the morning, the waiter holding the room also caused a lot of noise.Not well, often awakened.There is also a suggestion that I just met heavy rain on the day when I left. When I went out, I had a good weather without an umbrella, but at that time, the rain was heavy.His umbrella took me to a bus stop at tens of meters away, and at the railway station, he was soaked and shaken. In fact, the hotel can order some cheap short umbrellas to the rain.The guests of the umbrella are not high in cost, only a few yuan per hand, but the hotel's intention to the guests can make them unforgettable for a long time.On the opposite side, there is a construction site with several high -end luxury homes, which may be involved in the middle of the year. At that time, there may be restaurants or small shop supermarkets. I will consider living in this housing estate ...For a period of time, I still stay back to the old city."
1,房间OK，但隔音差，服务也不错，地理位置不太理想。,"The room is OK, but the sound insulation is poor, the service is also good, and the geographical location is not ideal."
1,地理位置好，离蓬莱阁和海边近，房间还整洁，服务热情周到，早餐也不错，美中不足就是设施有些陈旧。补充点评2007年8月29日：抱歉，错把蓬莱打上去了，那里没有的，特纠正，谢谢。,"The geographical location is good, close to Penglai Pavilion and the seaside, the room is neat, the service is warm and thoughtful, and the breakfast is also good.Supplementary reviews on August 29, 2007: Sorry, I did not hit Penglai up, there was no, special correction, thank you."
1,晚上泡温泉之后已过八点，只能够选择在酒店的中餐厅吃饭，朋友和家人对菜品的味道赞不绝口，可以说是我们假日出游所最意想不到的收获，所以特别在这里对酒店做出鼓励！,It has been eight o'clock after soaking in the hot springs at night. I can only choose to eat in the hotel's Chinese restaurant. Friends and family members praise the dishes. It can be said that it is the most unexpected harvest of our holiday travel.Encouragement!
1,"这里环境还算不错,吃海鲜也便宜,当时买当时煮,很鲜","The environment here is pretty good, and eating seafood is cheap. At that time, I bought it at the time, which was very fresh."
1,8月24日入住，25日离开的。订的小套房，才210，很划算。房间很干净，很大。还有个凉台。感觉真好。下次还来。晚上外边虫子很多，害怕虫子的朋友建议就在房间里呆着吧:),"Check -in on August 24th and left on the 25th.The small suite that is booked is only 210, which is very cost -effective.The room is very clean and very large.There is also a Liangtai.Feels great.Come next time.There are a lot of bugs outside at night, friends who are afraid of bugs are advised to stay in the room :)"
1,房间还不错，可惜酒店地点不大好找，而且我的房间号居然在出电梯后的楼层标牌上没有标注，害我找了半天。早餐还不错，清爽简洁。,"The room is not bad. Unfortunately, the hotel location is not easy to find, and my room number is actually not marked on the floor signs after the elevator out of the elevator, which hurts me for a long time.Breakfast is not bad, refreshing and simple."
1,环境：酒店环境尚可，周边环境一般，要到大宁国际那边才有不错的商店和饭店。和携程上说的一样，部分楼层在装修，所以下午5点前可能无法休息，好在我白天都不在，受到的影响不大。服务：服务一般，没有四星的水准。在前台都是我提问，也没有获得应有的招呼，进酒店的时候服务生也没有帮忙开门以及拉一下行李。房间：预订的是大床房，但是床只是普通的5尺床，不过好在也够了。房间布局很雅致，热水、空调，房间隔音都很好。这也是我满意的地方。其他：早餐还可以，二楼有个泰国鱼翅馆，看看价格还比较公道，不过没有吃。房间里有宽带，但是路由器上没有电源。也就没有问前台要了。总之，比较中规中矩。周围也没有更好的酒店了(大宁国际的福朋除外)。500-/日，还是可以接受的,"Environment: The hotel environment is acceptable, and the surrounding environment is average. It is only necessary to have good shops and restaurants from Daning International.Like Ctrip said, some floors are renovating, so it may not be able to rest before 5 pm. Fortunately, I am not there during the day, and it is not affected.Service: The service is average, there is no level of four -star.I asked questions at the front desk, and I did not get the greetings I had. When I entered the hotel, the waiter did not help open the door and pulled my luggage.Room: Booking a large bed room, but the bed is just a normal 5 -foot bed, but fortunately, it is enough.The layout of the room is very elegant, hot water, air conditioning, and room sound insulation.This is where I am satisfied.Others: Breakfast is okay. There is a Thai shark fins on the second floor. It is more fair to see the price, but not eaten.There is a broadband in the room, but there is no power on the router.I didn't ask the front desk.In short, it is quite satisfactory.There are no better hotels around (except Fu Peng International).500-/day, it is still acceptable"
1,房间还可以。总体没有什么不满意的地方，就是这个地点比较偏，如果不准备出门的话还是可以的。第二天去开利上南北高架桥十分方便。,"The room is ok.There is no dissatisfaction in general, that is, this place is relatively biased. If you are not ready to go out, it is still possible.It is very convenient to go to the Cairi upper north and south viaducts the next day."
1,我的国外客人十分满意，我本人对大堂和门童也是很满意。,"My foreign guests are very satisfied, and I am also very satisfied with the lobby and door children."
1,追加一点，早餐尽量不要在酒店吃。能吃的食物少的可怜，如果阁下是位正在依靠咖啡减肥的人事，这里是最好的去处，因为别的都没有，咖啡倒是可以让你喝饱。更要命的是要求添加些食物居然遭到服务员的白眼！交了钱得不到应有的服务和起码的食物供应，这是酒店给我留下的最深的印象和遗憾宾馆反馈2006年12月11日：感谢您提出的宝贵意见。点评中所涉及的相关问题酒店已给予高度重视并正对早餐等相关问题根据客人的需求和酒店的服务标准作出改进和调整。酒店质监部已加强了对服务质量的督导。,"Add a little bit, try not to eat at the hotel as much as possible.There are few foods that can be eaten. If you are a person who is relying on coffee to lose weight, this is the best place, because there is no other, coffee can make you full.What is even more terrible is that adding foods are actually white -eyed by the waiter!If you pay the money, you ca n’t get the service you deserve and the at least food supply. This is the deepest impression and regret of the hotel that the hotel has left me on December 11, 2006: Thank you for your valuable opinions.Related issues involved in the comment have given great importance to and are improving and adjusting related issues such as breakfast according to the needs of the guests and the service standards of the hotel.The hotel Quality Supervision Department has strengthened the supervision of service quality."
1,周末和老婆过去住的，感觉还不错，环境比较好。酒店的服务还可以，但是服务员见到了客人连招呼都不打一个，这点感觉服务员的素质还需要改变，总体感觉不错,"I lived with my wife on the weekend. I feel pretty good and the environment is better.The hotel's service is okay, but the waiter saw that the guests did not even say hello. This feels that the quality of the waiter needs to be changed. Generally, it feels good."
1,过来和朋友度假的，离尚湖虞山都很近。去王四酒家就马路对面走过去一点就到了。环境服务包括早餐都很好。游泳池很干净，人也少，沐浴更衣的地方也很宽敞，只是里面的桑拿不开，要求服务人员开等我游好了也没开，需要改进。早餐质量不错，最好能分吸烟区和非吸烟区。酒店大堂的装饰也很有味道，我喜欢的。总体性价比很高，值得再次入住。,"Those who come over with friends are very close to Shanghu Yushan.When you go to Wang Si Rabo, you can walk across the road.Environmental services include breakfast.The swimming pool is very clean, there are also few people, and the place where the bathing and changing clothes are also very spacious. However, the sauna inside is not open. It is required that the service staff will wait for me to swim.The quality of breakfast is good, it is best to be able to divide the smoking area and non -smoke -absorbing area.The decoration of the hotel lobby is also very delicious, I like it.The overall cost performance is very high, and it is worth checking in again."
1,房间环境服务都还不错，关键是价格很好，四星差不多。,"The room environmental service is not bad. The key is that the price is good, and the four -star is almost the same."
1,这是我第二次入住这个酒店，感觉服务比前一次差很多，大门的保安没有帮我提行李，门童也没有为我开门。到前台chenkin的时候也没有人来接待，等了半天才有一个服务员来接待我。感觉很失望，本来第一次住的时候感觉很好的才会来第二次入住的，但这次的态度让我产生了以后永远不再来的想法。可能有人开到了我的不满，到房间后有一个好像是客服的人给我打电话问我对他们酒店的看法和建议，我告诉她我的不满，她连连道歉，说下次一定改进，这样稍稍打消了我以后不再来的念头。总的来说，这还是一家不错的酒店，位置有点偏但很安静。,"This is the second time I stayed at this hotel. I feel that the service is much worse than the previous time. The security guards at the door have not helped me raise my luggage, and the door children did not open the door for me.No one came to the front desk to receive it when I got it. After waiting for a long time, a waiter came to receive me.It feels disappointed. I felt good when I lived for the first time before I would come to stay for the second time, but this attitude made me never come again.Someone may have drove my dissatisfaction. After arriving at the room, a person who seemed to be a customer service called me to ask me my views and suggestions on their hotel. I told her that my dissatisfaction was.A little dispelled the thoughts I won't come again in the future.In general, this is still a good hotel with a bit of the location but very quiet."
1,这是握住过的最便宜的五星级酒店，金陵酒店管理的，酒店的硬件很部错，卫生间的面盆与淋浴房的间隔有点小。,This is the cheapest five -star hotel that has been held. Jinling Hotel is managed. The hotel's hardware is very wrong. The interval between the basin and the shower room in the bathroom is a bit small.
1,作为一个老牌的3星级酒店，。。还是有其优越性和成熟性的。。服务较规范，。。（当然还是存在个别员工消极怠慢的）。。电瓶车的小司机值得表演，。。真真的淳朴，，待客如家。。前台的接待女孩子表现较好，。。有耐心，。。愿帮客人解决问题。但繁忙时段管理稍乱，需改进。宾馆整体环境不错，。。尤其考虑到离上海这么近的佘山。。有如此的性价比，。。还不错。有机会还会去的。但周边交通不方便。特别是回程。叫不到车。如有良好的配套，应该会加分不少。顺便逛了逛，。。西佘山，和台湾人开的一个公园，月湖。西佘山幼时去了不少，。。顾地重游，还是有一些些的感慨，。。风景不能说不美，。。月湖，门票奇贵无比，环境不错是携家带小的好去处。也是第一次看到狗也要收费的地方，，30元。但也就是一公园罢了。。。,"As an old 3 -star hotel.EssenceThere is still its superiority and maturity.EssenceThe service is more standardized.Essence(Of course, some employees are neglecting negatively).EssenceThe little driver of the battery car is worth performing.EssenceIt's really simple, and the hospitality is like a home.EssenceThe reception girl at the front desk performed well.EssencePatient.EssenceMay help the guests solve the problem.However, the management of busy hours is slightly chaotic and needs to be improved.The overall environment of the hotel is good.EssenceEspecially considering Laoshan, which is so close to Shanghai.EssenceThere is such a cost -effective.Essencenot bad.I will go if I have a chance.But the surrounding traffic is inconvenient.Especially the return journey.Can't call the car.If you have good supporting facilities, you should add a lot.By the way, strolled around.EssenceXishan, a park with Taiwanese, Yuehu.West Laoshan went a lot when he was young.EssenceThere is still some emotions to re -travel to the ground.EssenceThe scenery cannot be said to be beautiful.EssenceYuehu, the tickets are extremely expensive, and the environment is good to bring a small place with a small family.It is also the first time that the dog has to charge, 30 yuan.But it is a park.EssenceEssence"
1,上个星期刚去过，非常好。自驾车过去很方便，从金沙江路过去路程差不多一个小时，订的是3号楼的大套间，实际拿到房间3303，房间非常大，还有个大阳台，不过好象不是每个房间都有，房间的布局还是不错的，酒店离佘山的森林公园实在是太近了，过去最多走5分钟就到了，酒店里吃的东西也还是不错的，总体来说很不错，酒店的服务和环境也非常让我满意，适合休息日过去放松。,"I just visited last week, very good.Self -driving was very convenient in the past. It was almost an hour from Jinshajiang Road in the past. The large suite of Building 3 was booked. Actually, I got 3303 in the room. The room was very large.Yes, the layout of the room is still good. The hotel is too close to the forest park in Laoshan. It has been here for up to 5 minutes in the past.It is also very satisfied with me, suitable for relaxation on the rest day."
1,如果要到东方绿舟去玩2天以上，那么住在绿舟内的宾馆，应该是不错的选择。宾馆有借3人或4人的脚踏车，和2人或单人的自行车，凭门卡可任意次进出绿舟，比较方便经济。房间不算小，设施还过得去。因为在2号门，所以位置有点偏。另外，除了绿舟宾馆外，东方绿舟内还有绿舟别墅和绿舟度假村，位置要好一点，但酒店标准应该比绿舟宾馆稍稍差一些。,"If you want to go to the East Green Boat for more than 2 days, then a hotel in the green boat should be a good choice.The hotel has bicycles of 3 or 4 people, and bicycles of 2 or single people. It can enter and exit the green boat at any time with the door card, which is more convenient for the economy.The room is not small, and the facilities have passed.Because at the gate 2, the location is a bit biased.In addition, in addition to the Green Boat Hotel, there are green boat villas and green boat resorts in the East Green Boat. The location is better, but the hotel standards should be slightly worse than the Green Boat Hotel."
1,酒店位于东方绿舟边缘，环境优美，空气清新。方便之处在于可直接从酒店旁的小路进入东方绿舟园区，无需门票。,"The hotel is located on the edge of the Oriental Green Boat, with beautiful environment and fresh air.The convenience is that you can enter the Oriental Green Boat Park directly from the path next to the hotel without tickets."
1,房间、卫生间都挺大，我们住的是大床房，床也很大，很干净，朝绿洲的这边可以看见东方绿洲的风景，除了酒店就可以直接进东方绿洲玩。但是酒店除了按摩外，没有其他娱乐设施。早餐品种不多，而且九点钟就结束了，没法睡懒觉。总体感觉还不错,"The rooms and bathrooms are quite large. We live in a large bed room. The beds are very large and clean. You can see the scenery of the Oriental Oasis from the oasis. In addition to the hotel, you can directly enter the Oriental Oasis.But the hotel has no other entertainment facilities except massage.There are not many breakfast varieties, and it is over at nine o'clock.feels pretty good in general"
1,酒店设施不错，服务很好。但是交通不方便，出租车不好找。去朱家角要计双程。且酒店没有什么娱乐设施。晚上比较无聊。酒店靠近东方绿洲2号口。2号口里有出租自行车的地方，强烈建议不要去那里租车。车子很破，服务很差。且4：30就关门。过点就没办法还车，押金就算买它的破车！？可以到1号口或者在酒店里面租车。,"The hotel facilities are good and the service is good.But the transportation is not convenient, and the taxi is not easy to find.Two ways to go to Zhujiajiao.And the hotel has no entertainment facilities.It's boring at night.The hotel is close to the Oriental Oasis 2.There is a place to rent a bicycle in the entrance 2. It is strongly recommended not to go there to rent there.The car is very broken and the service is poor.And close the door at 4:30.There is no way to pay back the car, even if the deposit buy its broken car!IntersectionYou can rent a car at Exit No. 1 or in the hotel."
1,携程的房价偏贵了，而且房间偏小了。其他，酒店应该是现在南通最好的了吧,"Ctrip's house prices are expensive, and the room is small.Others, the hotel should be the best in Nantong now, right?"
1,作为在人民广场附近的酒店来说这个价位算是比较低的，而且相对房间来说也不是很差。与一般的经济型酒店设施还是差不多的。但是酒店的地点却不是很熟悉，所以也是找了一段时间才找到。但是走到人民广场还是很方便的。,"As a hotel near People's Square, this price is relatively low, and it is not very bad compared to the room.It's almost the same as the general economy hotel facilities.But the hotel's location is not very familiar, so it was found for a while before finding it.But it is very convenient to walk to the People's Square."
1,"是第二次住了,服务还可以,还加了电脑可以上网。","It was the second time to live, the service is okay, and the computer can be added to the Internet."
1,1.入住时是6月底，海南的淡季。2.一人住了一栋别墅，当然按照规定只能睡一个房间。3.一个人享受200多平米是真够爽的，但到晚上也真有点心里不踏实的，尤其是外面其实就是一条又黑（看上去）又脏的万泉河！4.宾馆区域的景色和服务都是相当不错的，满意！5.据我同行的加拿大朋友说哪里的露天游泳池也相当不错，我只看到了外景，的确蛮诱人的，可惜我睡懒觉没去尝试。6.唯一可惜的是，由于是淡季早餐厅就我和老外两个人，室内的没开空调，就在露天的地方，景色是不错但实在热的够呛啊！宾馆就不能想想办法，不增加空调成本也能帮客户降降温嘛！,"1. At the end of June, the off -season of Hainan.2. One person lived in a villa, and of course he could only sleep in one room in accordance with regulations.3. It is really cool to enjoy more than 200 square meters, but at night, there is really a little bit unsteady, especially the outside of the Wanquan River that is dark (looking)!4. The scenery and services of the hotel area are quite good, satisfied!5. As far as I said where the Canadian friend said, the open -air swimming pool was quite good. I only saw the outside scene. It was really seductive. Unfortunately, I did n’t try to try lazily.6. The only pity is that because it is the off -season breakfast, I and the foreigner and I have two foreigners. There is no air conditioner in the room. It is in the open air. The scenery is good but hot enough!The hotel cannot think of a way. It can help customers cool down without increasing the cost of air conditioning!"
1,大型的别墅社区，环境非常安静、宜人，在阳台上面对流淌的河流、迎着和煦的清风，可以完全让你躲避城市的喧嚣，沉静心情、呼吸清新、放松身心，非常适合家庭度假，也可以个人静静的消磨。我定的独享单间也就是独享了整幢三层现代风格的别墅。不过房间风格过于单调，有可能由于客流非常的少（也由于占地较大而显得非常冷清），没有一般度假地的氛围，酒店的相关设施也由此可能显得有些薄弱。总体来说，确实可以让你体验到别样的度假感觉。,"The large villa community, the environment is very quiet and pleasant. On the balcony, the flowing rivers and the gentle breeze can completely allow you to avoid the hustle and bustle of the city.You can disappear quietly.My exclusive single room, that is, exclusively enjoying the whole three -story modern villa.However, the style of the room is too monotonous, and it may be because the passenger flow is very small (also because of the large area and it seems very deserted), and there is no atmosphere of general holiday places. The related facilities of the hotel may also seem a bit weak.Overall, you can really allow you to experience a different feeling of vacation."
1,我们这次圣诞新年假期原计划是在博鳌看宾斯基住一周的，结果一住就十天了。凯宾斯基饭店的环境是放松和度假的好地方，一百一十多幢的别墅掩映在亚热带的树林景色和河边当中，简花是见花草树林不见人，我们白天开车在饭店内怎么兜风，也没遇到几个人，等到晚上从别墅中透出来的灯光，才知道这里基本还有这么多地度假的人。从我们住的是独享单间，6天住港式风格的，4天住得是韩式风格的。整幢别墅只有我们两公婆，里面听宽敞的，饭店挺豪气的，或许呼应德国的品牌饭店吧，大冰箱、滚筒洗衣机是西门子，灯开关插座是西门子的，电熨斗是飞利浦的，抽油烟机是意大利的，多士炉是什么牌子忘了。或许想我们这样，带着面包面条橄榄油吞拿鱼罐头烟肉番茄酱在厨房开餐的人不多，所以，发现，多士炉是没人用过，全新的;洗衣机是全新没人用过的，让我这个小主妇开心的不亦乐乎！说说存在的问题吧。闲聊时得知，当年饭店为了赶工程，室内装修都出现了不同程度的质量问题，比如，装修的手工粗劣，正是因为连续住进的两套别墅的浴缸都严重渗水，才在饭店内挪了三次窝。饭店的早餐管理我认为有不妥。第一次登记入住是从28日开始到1月4日的，早餐券每天两张共14张一模一样的，开始两天没有去吃早餐，到了1号去餐厅看看，是自助早餐，虽然品种只有十来二十种，中西式都有，还好，不错，我还可以打包回去给老公。结果到了三号，我去了一看，啥都没有，只有经理和几个服务员在那，经理招呼我坐下后，已不见了。服务员收取了我两张早餐券，给我端上了一份中式早餐，一碗白粥，一小份炒面，一个包子一个馒头，完事。我无从下口，让服务员给我拿了一碗酸奶泡麦片，喝了，然后，让服务员打包两杯酸奶回去，结果服务员让我签单，我明白了，今天的免费早餐变了，只有一份中式的，我要的酸奶和麦片要另外付费，我一看账单，愣住了，3杯酸奶加一小碗麦片共76块人民币。4号续住的时候，我都懒得去领早餐券了，因为老公说，国务院三天假期过了，我们不能度假了。既然饭店是真正休闲度假的地方，我想饭店应该把客人住店的每一天都视之为假日，我真的承受不了一天冷一天热的服务概念。既然饭店要做远离尘嚣、远离喧闹的休闲度假区，我接受休闲度假区天天一样的房价，但必须给我天天一样的休闲度假的服务。对吧？幸好，我们带足够了厨房粮草，早餐、午餐我在厨房里忙乎，晚上到金海岸西餐厅晚餐，也优哉游哉的度过了一个搏鳌凯宾斯基假期。我们还计划，下次来的时候，把我妈妈和保姆也带上，再次入住凯宾斯基。,"Our Christmas and New Year holiday originally planned to see Bentki live in Boao for a week, but it was ten days after living.The environment of the Kobezki Hotel is a good place to relax and vacation. More than one hundred villas are hidden in the landscape and river of the subtropical woods. Jane flowers are not seen in the flowers and plants. How can we drive in the hotel during the day?I didn't meet a few people. When the lights came out of the villa at night, I knew that there were basically many people who had so many vacations here.From we live in a single room, we live in Hong Kong style for 6 days, and live in Korean style for 4 days.The whole villa is only our two in -laws. The spacious ones inside, the restaurant is very arrogant. Perhaps it echoes the German brand restaurant. The large refrigerator and the drum washing machine are Siemens. The light switch socket is Siemens.It is Italy, what brand of Du Shi furnace has forgotten.Maybe we think of us, and there are not many people with bread noodles olive oil swallowing fish, canned tobacco, cigarette meat and meat tomato sauce in the kitchen. Therefore, I found that no one has used the polyshi furnace, and the washing machine is brand new.I have been happy to make my little housewife happy!Talk about existing problems.I learned during the chat that in order to catch up the project, the restaurant had different degrees of quality problems in the interior decoration. For example, the decoration was too bad, because the bathtubs of the two villas that were continuously entered were severely exuded in the restaurant.Three times.Breakfast management in the hotel is inappropriate.The first registered check -in was from the 28th to January 4th. The breakfast coupons were the same for two pieces a day. I did not go to breakfast for two days. I went to the restaurant on the 1st.There are only ten or twenty types, both Chinese and Western styles. Fortunately, yes, I can also package it back to my husband.As a result, I went to the third, and I went to see anything. There was nothing. Only the manager and a few waiters were there. The manager greeted me to sit down.The waiter received two breakfast vouchers, and gave me a Chinese -style breakfast, a bowl of white porridge, a small stir -fried noodles, a bun and a steamed bun, finished.I couldn't get my mouth, let the waiter take me a bowl of yogurt oatmeal, drink it, and then let the waiter pack two cups of yogurt back. As a result, the waiter asked me to sign the bill. I understand that today's free breakfast has changed, there is only one copy, there is only one copy, there is only one copy, there is only one copy.In Chinese, the yogurt and oatmeal I want to pay separately. When I looked at the bill, I stunned. 3 cups of yogurt and a small bowl of oatmeal a total of 76 yuan.When I renewed on the 4th, I was too lazy to get a breakout coupon, because my husband said that the State Council had three days of vacation, and we could not take a vacation.Since the restaurant is a real place for leisure vacations, I think the hotel should regard the guests' living in the shop every day as a holiday. I really can't bear the concept of service that is cold and one day.Since the restaurant is going to be a leisure resort that is far away from the hustle and bustle, I accept the same house prices of the leisure resort every day, but I must give me a casual vacation service every day.Right?Fortunately, we brought enough food and grass in the kitchen. I was busy with breakfast and lunch in the kitchen. I went to the Golden Coast West Restaurant for dinner at night.We also planned to bring my mother and nanny next time, and stay in Kimbinski again."
1,挂牌三星；房间大，布置有特色，墙上挂画是亮点；1楼旺鑫阁餐厅吃饭方便；5楼足浴对住店客人有打折；酒店对面就是大润发，购物便捷；早餐稍逊是小小遗憾，不过KFC就在大润发1楼，可以作为备选。总体感觉性价比很高了！,"Samsung is listed; the room is large, the arrangement has characteristics, and the painting on the wall is a highlight; the first floor of Wangxin Pavilion restaurant is convenient to eat; the 5th floor foot bath is discounted to the guests of the store; the opposite of the hotel is RT -Mart, which is convenient to shop;Unfortunately, KFC is on the first floor of RT -Mart and can be used as an alternative.The overall feeling is very cost -effective!"
1,酒店的外、内部环境还是很不错的，服务生的服务意识也还可以，但里面吃的东东有些贵，另外携程确认定单时间有些拖延，打车到了宾馆后，被通知没有３２０元的房间了，只能住５２０的了，呜．．．对于自助旅行的偶来讲，有些奢侈．．．．．,"The outside and internal environment of the hotel is still very good, and the waiter's service awareness is OK, but the stuff in it is a bit expensive. In addition, Ctrip confirms that the time for a single time is delayed. After taking a taxi to the hotel, he was notified that there was no 320 yuan room., I can only live 520, woo.....For self -service travel, some are luxurious........."
1,酒店位于南北主干道旁，交通非常便利，特别适合自驾车旅游者。（酒店门口免费停车）房间设施不错，服务态度挺好。就是牡丹节期间洛阳的酒店价格都上浮厉害。,The hotel is located next to the main roads of the north and south. The transportation is very convenient and is especially suitable for self -driving tourists.(Free parking at the door of the hotel) The room facilities are good and the service attitude is good.It is the price of Luoyang's hotels during the Mudan Festival.
1,"20070501日入住,3星酒店4星的价格!","Check in 2007050, the price of 3 stars at 3 stars!"
1,酒店位置不错，房间也比较干净。酒店服务员的办理速度还比较快，而且态度不错，主动告诉我们到各旅游点的公交线路。早餐一般，但是老公说还可以。在这里吃了一顿晚饭，也是一般。不过这里到洛阳的各个大景点的公交非常方便，就在酒店门口，出门就是。不错,"The hotel location is good and the room is relatively clean.The hotel waiter is relatively fast, and his attitude is good, and he takes the initiative to tell us to go to the bus lines of each tourist spot.Breakfast is average, but the husband said it is okay.It is also average to have dinner here.However, the bus to the major attractions in Luoyang here is very convenient. Just at the door of the hotel, just go out.good"
1,帮朋友订的，在上海来说价格是比较实惠的了。不过朋友住了后没有特别说很好也没有不满，呵呵！,"The price is more affordable in Shanghai for helping friends.However, after living in my friends, I did n’t say that I was very good or dissatisfied, haha!"
1,一入住，就有服务员送来水果和报纸，服务很好，结账速度很快。,"As soon as I settled, there was a waiter who sent fruits and newspapers. The service was very good and the checkout speed was fast."
1,"房间还不错,挺大的也挺干净的,就是价格有点高了,徐州的消费没那么高的.","The room is pretty good, and it is quite clean, that is, the price is a bit high, and the consumption of Xuzhou is not so high."
1,房间很干净，条件比较好，上网速度很快，早餐很丰盛，但在徐州这个位置，价格偏高，要是在200以内就好了。,"The room is very clean, the conditions are better, the Internet speed is fast, and the breakfast is very rich, but in this position in Xuzhou, the price is high, if it is within 200."
1,总体来说不错，入住的是商务间，很整齐，床还挺大的。就是住的那间空调不能开，一开就断电，找了总台，服务态度挺好的，维修工也马上来修了，但是因为是线路问题没法短时间内解决，想想正好晚上也不用开，也就算了。娱乐、餐饮一应俱全，总体来说比较满意。,"Overall it is good. The business room is neat, and the bed is quite large.That is, the air conditioner that lives cannot be turned on, and the power is disconnected as soon as it is turned on. I found the main station. The service attitude was very good.No need to open, even if it is.Entertainment and catering are all available, generally satisfied."
1,"物超所值,房间比较新,干净.温泉很不错,早餐也很好.","Masterpiece is worth it, the room is relatively new, clean. The hot spring is very good, and the breakfast is also very good."
1,"市交通不便利,四周境佳,泉游泳池想像中那好,更衣室管理差,又附早餐,其他算可以.","The city's transportation is inconvenient, the surroundings are good, the spring swimming pool is good, the locker room management is poor, and the breakfast is attached. Others can."
1,房间在当地还不错。早餐一般般。周边环境不错，有鸡骚扰。,"The room is pretty good in the local area.Breakfast is general.The surrounding environment is good, there are chickens harassment."
1,酒店的地理位置很好，到王府井、景山公园、故宫都比较近，可以步行。但是交通不太便利，离地铁稍微远点，有行李的话不太方便。前台的服务也还不错，面带笑容。入住时没拿景山公园的门票，再去要的时候小姐也很不错，帮忙查找。房间很小，但是对于睡觉来说也够了。我住的房间正对着景山公园最高的亭子，感觉不错。,"The hotel's geographical location is very good. It is relatively close to Wangfujing, Jingshan Park, and the Forbidden City. You can walk.However, traffic is not convenient, and it is a little far away from the subway. It is not convenient to have luggage.The front desk service is also good, with a smile.I did n’t get the tickets in Jingshan Park when I checked in, and the lady was very good when I went to ask, and helped find it.The room is small, but it is enough for sleeping.The room I live in is facing the tallest pavilion in Jingshan Park, and it feels good."
1,"很好的酒店,广交会期间价格也合理.早餐很好.网络一般,但是就是无法发邮件,据说是被电讯控制上传,莫名其妙.和酒店反映情况,态度很好就是不解决问题.对商务客人来说是致命的.....","Very good hotel, the price of the Canton Fair is also reasonable. The breakfast is very good. The network is general, but it is not possible to send an email. It is said that it is uploaded by telecommunications. It is inexplicable.Said to be fatal ..."
1,我是第二次住在这里了，前一次是二年多之前了，因为它离家很近，也是因为喜欢它．所以再次选择了它．房间比较大，订的是大床房，很宽，基本等于二张小床放在一起了．我们一家三口睡得很宽敞．很舒服．房间洗手间也感觉很舒服，很大，有浴缸，有花洒，也很干净．员工的服务还不错，有宾至如归的感觉．由于前面网友的介绍，特意要求了楼层高的房间，安排在八楼，晚上很安静．早餐由于是过年，要与家人一起用，因此送的早餐（可惜只送一份）就浪费了．很喜欢这里，虽然感觉贵一点点，但还是很舒服．还会继续选它．,"I have lived here for the second time. The previous time was more than two years ago, because it was very close to home, because I like it.So I chose it again.The room is relatively large, and the large bed room is wide, which is very wide, which is basically equal to the two small beds together.The family of three of our family slept very spacious.Very comfortable.The toilet in the room also feels very comfortable, very large, with a bathtub, a shower, and a clean.The employee's service is not bad.Due to the introduction of the netizens in front, the room with high floors was specifically requested, and it was arranged on the eighth floor. It was quiet at night.Because the breakfast is Chinese, you need to use it with your family, so the breakfast sent (unfortunately only one copy) is wasted.I like it very much. Although it feels a little more expensive, it is still very comfortable.Will continue to choose it."
1,"交通挺方便,酒店里面装修还比较新,适合出差住","The transportation is very convenient, the decoration in the hotel is relatively new, suitable for business trips"

1,"很不错,至少有四星级的水准.性价比高..........","Very good, at least four -star level. The cost -effective .........."
1,1）地处城市中心，出门便是热闹市街。周边九龙壁，华严寺等景点徒步可达。2）入住的豪华大床房，干净整洁，设施基本齐全，布局比较合理人性化。卫生间设计简洁，都是美标卫浴。就是洗澡水的温度比较难调节，可能是个别房间问题。3）一楼的自助早餐内容丰富，所有品种在服务时间段内供应充足，不用担心起来晚了就会选择少了。4）唯独软件方面有点遗憾。个别前台服务小姐的工作热情还有欠缺，对于一个国际大酒店来说云冈国际的员工素质还有待进一步提高。服务业里微笑是基本，请给客人一个舒心的真诚的笑。,"1) Located in the center of the city, going out is a lively city street.The surrounding Kowloon Wall, Huayan Temple and other scenic spots can be reached.2) The luxurious large bed room staying in, clean and tidy, the facilities are basically complete, and the layout is more reasonable and humane.The bathroom design is simple, all of which are beautiful bathrooms.The temperature of bath water is more difficult to adjust, and it may be a problem with individual rooms.3) The content of the buffet breakfast on the first floor is rich in content. All varieties are sufficient during the service period. Don't worry about it, you will choose less when you get late.4) Only the software is a bit regrettable.The enthusiasm for the work of the front desk lady is still lacking. For an international hotel, the quality of Yungang International's employee needs to be further improved.Smile in the service industry is basic, please give guests a comfortable and sincere smile."
1,马马乎乎，早餐稍弱，只有那小米粥好喝，其他的一般．电视频道比较少，不太符合五星级宾馆的标准．其他都还不错．,"Moma, breakfast is slightly weak, only the millet porridge is delicious, others are general.There are relatively few TV channels, which does not meet the standards of five -star hotels.Others are pretty good."
1,还可以大堂也不错房间也不错价格也还合理免费的早餐也很不错。。比较满意下次还住的可能很大。。。,You can also have a good lobby. The room is also good and the price is also very good. Breakfast is also very good.EssenceIt may be very satisfied with the next time you still live a lot.EssenceEssence
1,酒店服务非常好，房间还可以，总之比较满意啦！,"The hotel service is very good, the room is okay, anyway, it is more satisfied!"
1,这个酒店相对来说还是很不错的，隔音效果很好，服务也不错，硬件设施也相对不错，值得推荐。,"This hotel is relatively good, the sound insulation is very good, the service is good, the hardware facilities are relatively good, it is worth recommending."
1,酒店环境、服务、房间都非常不错，酒店的地理位置非常好，是闹市，走几步路就是著名的1912酒吧区了。CTRIP的价格也比较有优势，下次去南京还会选这家的。,"The hotel environment, services, and rooms are very good. The hotel's geographical location is very good. It is a downtown. A few steps are the famous 1912 bar area.The price of CTRIP is also relatively advantageous. The next time you go to Nanjing, you will choose this one."
1,上次入住时对这里的豪华自助早餐印象深刻，记得二楼四面环绕有三面都有各式各样的食品，中西皆有，琳琅满目，所以特别给家人推荐了一下，结果这次没那么好了，只有一面有食品，东西也少了很多，害我没面子！服务还是很不错的，下次有机会还会来的。,"When I stayed in the last time I stayed, I was impressed by the luxurious self -service breakfast here. Remember that there are all kinds of foods on the four sides of the two sides on the two sides of the two -sided sides.There is only one side with food, and things are much less, which hurts me without face!The service is still very good, I will come next time."
1,订了度假套餐，相当划算。在酒店里参加了高尔夫/网球。。。还有餐券优惠。酒店的服务设施都不错。坐落在山区里，景色很好。典型的度假村，人很放松。值得一提的是用餐还是在酒店好，周围的饭店比较宰人，价格差不多的，但是卫生和服务差很多哦。总的来说很满意的。,"It is quite cost -effective to book a holiday package.I participated in the golf/tennis in the hotel.EssenceEssenceThere are also meal coupons discounts.The hotel's service facilities are good.Located in the mountains, the scenery is very good.The typical resort is very relaxed.It is worth mentioning that dining is better in the hotel. The surrounding restaurants are relatively slaughtered. The price is similar, but the health and service are much worse.Generally speaking, very satisfied."
1,真是一个避世休闲的好地方，但是（１）二楼西餐厅做的饭实在难咽下去，不如在大门右侧对面的小饭店用餐，实惠而且有正规发票．（２）游泳池要收费．（３）夏天蚊子太大．补充点评2007年5月23日：忘了一点很重要的，就是去的时候最好是下小雨，烟雨中更显江南虫二了，好去处啊．,"It is really a good place to avoid the world, but (1) The rice made on the second floor on the second floor is hard to swallow. It is better to eat at the small restaurant opposite the right side of the gate. It is affordable and has a regular invoice.(2) The swimming pool should be charged.(3) Summer mosquitoes are too big.Supplementary comment on May 23, 2007: It is important to forget that it is better to go down when it goes. It is even more rainy in the smoke and rain."
1,由于天气预报的不确定性，预定过程中更改了几次时间，都顺利完成。前台服务态度非常好。度假村很气派，环境极佳，可惜我们入住的时候正是下雨天，没能好好享受一下跟美景的亲密接触。,"Due to the uncertainty of weather forecast, it has been changed several times during the scheduled process, and it has been successfully completed.The front desk service attitude is very good.The resort is very elegant and the environment is excellent. Unfortunately, it was rainy days when we stayed, and we couldn't enjoy the intimate contact with the beautiful scenery."
1,不错如果是欧美人士入住，那将是一个不错的选择因为酒店主要提供英语服务其他区亚裔地区的语言服务就没有可日本客人入住的话会很困扰,"Yes, if it is a European and American people, it will be a good choice because the hotel mainly provides language services in Asian regions in other districts in other districts."
1,酒店很超值，干净卫生，尤其值得一提的是在前台办理入住时服务员看到我们携带一个小孩，主动提出酒店有大床带单床的房间，而且价格不变，服务热情，周到，价格合理，真是不错的选择，下次去肯定还选他。,"The hotel is very value for value, clean and hygienic. It is particularly worth mentioning that the waiter saw us carrying a child when handling in at the front desk and actively proposed that the hotel has a large bed with a single bed with a single bed, and the price is unchanged, the service is enthusiastic, thoughtful, the priceReasonable, really a good choice. I will definitely choose him next time."
1,这已经是第N次入住国贸了，感觉还和以前一样，干净、舒适。前台小姐虽然换了一些新面孔，但热情依旧。早餐比以前似乎增加不少品种，卫生、可口。地理位置好，打的方便给我出行节约了不少时间。,"This is the first time to stay in China Trade. It feels like before, clean and comfortable.Although the front desk lady changed some new faces, her enthusiasm was still.Breakfast seems to add a lot of varieties than before, hygiene and delicious.The geographical location is good, and the convenience of playing has saved a lot of time for me to travel."
1,总体不错，唯一是房间隔音不太好，其他都不错宾馆反馈2008年6月20日：首先非常感谢您入住国贸大酒店，感谢您对本酒店服务及设施的认可，我们将会继续努力。酒店会增加隔音设施，为客人提供更加宁静的休息空间，再次感谢您对本酒店的关注和评价，我们会继续努力，希望您下次入住能使您更满意。,"Overall, the only thing is that the room's sound insulation is not very good. Others are good for the hotel to feedback June 20, 2008: First of all, thank you very much for staying at the International Trade Hotel, thank you for your recognition of the hotel service and facilities, we will continue to work hard.The hotel will increase sound insulation facilities to provide guests with more peaceful rest space. Thank you again for your attention and evaluation of the hotel. We will continue to work hard. I hope you will be more satisfied with you next time you check in."
1,虽然房间比较小，有早餐而且性价比较高；我同时预定了3个房间，却竟然给安排在三个角落上，不知道怎么能这样补充点评2007年10月29日：还有：网速非常之慢，是我住过所有酒店里最慢的,"Although the room is relatively small, there is breakfast and the cost is relatively high; I have booked 3 rooms at the same time, but I even arranged it on three corners. I don't know how to add this commented on October 29, 2007: Also: The network speed is very very network speed very: very network speedSlowness is the slowest in all hotels I have lived in all hotels"
1,大堂还是一样漂亮。电梯入口附近有焕然一新的感觉，虽然还是老电梯但是通道和灯光明显整理过。房间和地毯都比去年入住的时侯更好。网线较短不过也算很方便。最大的不愉快就是房间的门很松，锁上后门仍然可以轻松的来回晃动，另外每天房间地板上都会有甚学生妹陪游之类的广告卡片、不知道安保是怎么做的。服务人员相当热情主动。楼层服务员甚至可以在电梯口就知道你是住甚房间的，感觉相当到位的服务。周围环境非常方便，家乐福的购物、必胜客的西式简餐、仙踪林的中式和免费无线、对于周围环境来说太方便了。楼下就有两个大的绿地，一个是老火车站绿地。一个步行3个很短的路口，就是五一广场公园。适合当成一个据点。另外虽然4楼就是夜总会，但是绝无其它酒店那种门童到里面小姐到处“过分热情”的尴尬。让你感觉很有安全感。,"The lobby is still as beautiful.There is a new feeling near the elevator entrance. Although the old elevator is still the old elevator, the channel and the light have been clearly organized.The rooms and carpets are better than when they stayed last year.The network cable is short, but it is very convenient.The biggest unpleasantness is that the door of the room is very loose. You can still shake back and forth easily when you lock the back door. In addition, there will be advertising cards such as students and girls on the floor floor every day. I do n’t know how to do security.The service staff is quite enthusiastic and active.The floor waiter can even know that you live in a very room at the elevator. It feels quite in place.The surrounding environment is very convenient. Carrefour's shopping, Pizza Hut's Western -style meal, Chinese style and free wirelessness of the fairy forest are too convenient for the surrounding environment.There are two large green space downstairs, one is the green space of the old railway station.A short intersection of walking is the May 1st Plaza Park.Suitable as a stronghold.In addition, although the 4th floor is the nightclub, there are no other hotel children who are ""too enthusiastic"" everywhere.Makes you feel secure."
1,前台服务不错，给的第一个房间恰好在服务员休息室对面，不是很满意，怕吵，去前台要求更换，也挺快就做好了。订的是商务大床房，房间不错，挺大的。就有几个不是很满意：1、床感觉比较单薄，而且不好靠，直接就是木板墙，靠着看电视硬硬的，很难受。2、这房间的淋浴头有问题，竟然像机关枪似的“突...突...突...”出水，洗个澡还挺累的。3、电视遥控器不大灵光了，呵呵。2、3应该是个例。总之还是不错的~~~,"The front desk service is good. The first room given is just opposite the waiter's lounge. It is not very satisfied, afraid of noisy, go to the front desk for replacement, and it is very fast.The big business bed is made, the room is good and quite big.There are a few of them are not very satisfied: 1. The bed feels thin and not easy to rely on. It is the wooden board wall directly. It is difficult to watch TV hard.2. There is a problem with the shower head in this room. It turned out to be a ""sudden ... sudden ... sudden ..."" out of the water. It was quite tired to take a bath.3. The TV remote control is not very bright, haha.2 and 3 should be an example.In short, it's good ~~~"
1,"我觉得还不错,三楼有金凯悦中餐厅,据说大师傅是潮州烹饪协会的主席,我们吃了一席,还不错,感觉菜还比较精致.旁边的府城是吃点心小吃的.呵呵.我们也觉得还好,因为比较方便.口味也还行.房间还不错,很干净,也蛮新的.服务人员的态度也不错,而且酒店房间外面的走廊很宽敞,给人的感觉很舒服","I think it's not bad. On the third floor, there is a Jinnieyue Chinese restaurant. It is said that the master is the chairman of the Chaozhou Culinary Association. We ate a seat. It is not bad. It feels more delicate.Fortunately, because it is more convenient. The taste is also okay. The room is not bad, very clean, and quite new. The attitude of the service staff is also good, and the corridor outside the hotel room is very spacious and feels very comfortable to feel comfortable."
1,"酒店可能有点年限了所以设施很旧,说是三星可感觉估计也就二星到顶了,服务也很一般,关键是价格和我后来朋友介绍的其他酒店相比差很多哦,以后不会住了!","The hotel may be a bit old, so the facilities are very old. It is said that Samsung feels that it is estimated that the two stars have reached the top, and the service is very average. The key is that the price is much worse than other hotels I introduced later, and will not live in the future!"
1,如果不是太西化，不建议住这儿，房间较小，有些旧，用具都还不错。服务应该说还不错，反应也快。但太偏了，丽江到香格里拉已是晚上，司机用了毛骨悚然来形态，呵呵。,"If it is not too western, it is not recommended to live here. The room is small, some old, and the utensils are good.The service should be pretty good and the response is fast.But it was too biased, Lijiang to Shangri -La was already at night, and the driver used the creepy form, huh, huh."
1,刚刚经历了在丽江丽王酒店的痛苦经历，来到这里我被酒店的服务感动了，这才是真正的酒店，我觉得像回到家里一样。唯一的缺点是租车太贵了。,I just experienced the painful experience at the Lijiang Liwang Hotel. I came here and was moved by the hotel's service. This is the real hotel. I feel like returning home.The only disadvantage is that renting a car is too expensive.
1,很温暖舒适，服务很好，房间有点小，就价格来说设施有点差。餐厅还不错,"Very warm and comfortable, the service is very good, the room is a bit small, the price is a bit bad in terms of price.The restaurant is not bad"
1,直得推荐的酒店，虽然价钱比较昂贵，但服务生是从心来招待我们，再者酒店用的品版都是有牌子的东西，对于我们香港游客来说，信心会加添不少。酒店设计很有藏族的味道，餐厅水准不俗，值得一试！最欣赏是他们大堂的姜茶，及半夜仍会努力解决我们客人的种种要求，而且不会额外收费，衷心的推荐。,"Although the recommended hotels, although the price is more expensive, the waiter entertains us from the heart. In addition, the hotel's products are all with brands. For our Hong Kong tourists, confidence will add a lot.The design of the hotel has a Tibetan taste. The restaurant has a good level and it is worth trying!The most appreciation is the ginger tea in their lobby, and in the middle of the night, we will still work hard to solve the requirements of our guests, and will not charge extra charges and sincerely recommend it."
1,房间极小，无盥洗用具，浴室水温无法控制。,"The room is very small, and the water temperature of the bathroom cannot be controlled."
1,很精致的藏式酒店，坐落在松赞林寺旁边，早朝松赞林寺再方便不过；酒店服务挺周到，房间很干净，被褥十分舒适；餐厅不大但很精巧，最喜欢的就是没有饭菜油烟的味道，因为饭菜都是在楼下厨房做好从一个窗口送进来的。餐厅的价格很合理，口味也不错；早餐品种虽然不多，不过藏式粑粑和牦牛酸奶不可不尝；招牌的藏式火锅完全没有想象中的浓油重盐，非常清淡可口，尤其是里面的豆腐猪肉丸，很好吃！不喜欢清淡对口味的可以跟卓玛要个蘸水；喝不完的酥油茶还可以留到第二天，卓玛会热了端过来；酒店大堂旁边的精品柜台出售的藏饰做工非常精美，是经理专程从尼泊尔挑回来的，完全不是外面那些粗制滥造的恶俗款式，当然价格也是不菲，找经理也只能有9折的优惠。酒店不好的地方就是门口那条路还没修好，离县城稍微有点距离，没有包车的要当心出租车司机漫天要价。酒店不提供一次性拖鞋包括洗漱用品，要自己带齐哦！补充点评2007年11月1日：网友说的看星星的房间我觉得如果是这个季节入住的话其实不需要的，有阳台的话会比较冷，大冷天我想没人愿意在外面吹北风吧；夏天的话还是可以的，到前台的时候可以提出要求，服务员会耐心的打开房间让你看的,"The exquisite Tibetan hotel is located next to the Songzanlin Temple. It is more convenient for the early facing the Songzanlin Temple; the hotel service is very good, the room is very clean, and the bedding is very comfortable; the restaurant is not big but very delicate.The taste, because the meals are sent in from a window downstairs.The price of the restaurant is very reasonable and the taste is good; although there are not many breakfast varieties, it is necessary to try Tibetan and yak yogurt;Tofu pork balls, delicious!Those who don't like light and right can dip in Zhuima. The ghee tea that can not be finished can stay until the next day, and Zhuoma will get hot;The manager made a special trip from Nepal. It is not the vulgar styles of the rough and abuse outside the outside. Of course, the price is also unsatisfactory. Finding a manager can only have a 10 % discount.The bad place in the hotel is that the road at the door has not been repaired, and it is a little bit distance from the county seat. Be careful of the taxi driver who is not a chartered car.The hotel does not provide disposable slippers, including toiletries, and take it yourself!Supplementary comment on November 1, 2007: Netizens said to see the Star's room. I think if it is staying this season, it is actually not needed. If there is a balcony, it will be cold.; Summer is still possible. When you go to the front desk, you can make a request. The waiter will open the room patiently to let you see"
1,"各方面都还不错,只是前台接待不知道怎么想的,我和她说要2个房间靠一起,不在一起也要近点,她还是给了个319和325房间,这2个房间各了9个房间!!牛!还和我说只隔3个房间!不知道怎么想的.更晕的是我们入住的当天下午我隔壁才有人住,我们入住的时候都没人住,晕啊.","All aspects are not bad, but I do n’t know what to think at the front desk reception. I told her that I want 2 rooms to be together, and I have to be closer. She still gives a room 319 and 325. The two rooms have 9 rooms 9 each 9 each.A room !! Bull! I also told me that there are only 3 rooms! I do n’t know what to think. What is even more dizzy is that I only live next door on the afternoon of our stay. No one lives when we stay in."
1,"房间不错,地理位置也很好.性价比也相当了.如果是来欣赏天目湖的话确实很好的选择,但是离我的工作地点远了点.迎宾员的服务相当好,但是checkin的前台服务员服务就很不怎么样了,从来不知道什么是笑,问她","The room is good and the geographical location is very good. The cost -effectiveness is equal. If you come to appreciate the Tianmu Lake, it is really a good choice, but it is a bit far from my work location.The service is not very good. I never know what laughs, ask her"
1,周边环境优美，房间及餐厅服务到位，总台和礼宾服务周到。,"The surrounding environment is beautiful, the rooms and restaurants are in place, and the general station and the ceremony are thoughtful."
1,酒店服务员都很温柔亲切你有不满意的地方向他们提出都会尽量响应所有房间的风景都非常优美但是房间的隔音效果实在不行豪华套间虽然好一点但是上下楼层之间的隔音还是个不小问题,"The hotel waiters are very gentle and kind. You have no satisfaction with them that they will try to respond to the scenery of all rooms as beautiful as possible, but the sound insulation effect of the room is really not good."
1,"房间还不错,装修设施很不错,可惜装修设计太一般,服务一般,门童比较懒!","The room is not bad, the decoration facilities are very good, but unfortunately the decoration design is too average, the service is average, the door children are lazy!"
1,很不错的酒店，环境优美，设施也很新。可以看到东湖，周围交通也比较方便。要注意的是其实离武大本部还是挺远的。,"Very good hotel, beautiful environment and new facilities.You can see East Lake, and the surrounding traffic is more convenient.It should be noted that it is actually quite far from the Bud University Headquarters."
1,"房间舒适,宽带够快,服务员素质不错,还可以免费三餐.入住第一天有免费饮料送.餐厅的自助餐味道不错.出门打的也很方便.就是酒店暂时没有娱乐设施,除了KTV.","The room is comfortable, the broadband is fast enough, the quality of the waiter is good, and you can also have three free meals. On the first day of check -in, there is a free drink for delivery. The buffet of the restaurant has a good taste. It is also convenient to go out to play. That is, the hotel has no entertainment facilities for the time being, except KTV."
1,"很老的五星了,客观的说也许曾经无愧于这个头衔,可现在看到的实在是有些落伍了,强烈建议重新装修和更换新的设施了,不过服务还是很好的,当得知我们的不满意后,经理主动地给我们做了房间的升级.....服务很好","Very old five -star. Objectively speaking, maybe it is worthy of this title, but what I see now is a bit outdated. It is strongly recommended to renovate and replace new facilities, but the service is still very good. When we know that we know usAfter dissatisfaction, the manager took the initiative to make the room upgrade ..... The service is very good"
1,应该是济南最好的酒店了，不过从档次上来讲房间不够大，没有自带的商场是很大的遗憾！,"It should be the best hotel in Jinan, but in terms of grade, the room is not big enough. It is a pity that there is no shopping mall without its own!"
1,"房间还行,卫生间不大,算达到了三星的设施,在济源是最好的酒店了.服务员态度不错.不过晚上有时候洗澡水不热,害得我差点感冒.早餐品种不多,自助餐30元还算过得去.","The room is okay, the bathroom is not large. It has reached Samsung's facilities. It is the best hotel in Jiyuan. The waiter has a good attitude. But sometimes the bath water is not hot at night, which makes me almost cold.Yuan still has to go."
1,本次是带了一帮好友去哥伦波太湖城堡过三十岁生日的，酒店所处自然环境和内部环境较好，我们晚上在总统夫人套房的露台上开生日party很有气氛！但度假的设施较少，泳池较小，水质不干净，水面上有很多小虫，没人敢下水游。健身房两台跑步机都不能用，桌球房硬间设施也较简陋。可能是在太湖边的半山上，房间内在晚上会有各种蚊子、飞蛾等飞进房间，房间没有砂窗。希望酒店能改进以上问题并加强管理。值得一提的是酒店下午专门开车去市区帮忙订了元祖的慕丝蛋糕，非常感动！当我们提出晚上party要用十张椅子，马上就有一位老伯分两次送进房间，非常感谢！晚上在玻璃餐厅吃的生日晚宴也不错，17人菜+酒水+元祖蛋糕=3092元。总体感觉此酒店比较适合两人世界休假、部门开会活动、三五好友小聚！补充点评2008年6月23日：另外卫生间的按摩浴缸非常舒服，但能有独立的淋浴房就太棒了！,"This time I brought a group of friends to the 330th birthday of the Castle of Columbus Taihu Castle. The natural environment and internal environment of the hotel were better. We were at an atmosphere on the birthday party on the terrace of the Presidential Madam in the evening!However, there are fewer vacation facilities, small swimming pools, poor water quality, and many small worms on the water surface. No one dares to go down the water.Both treadmills in the gym are not available, and the hard room facilities of the billiard room are also simple.It may be on the half mountains by the Taihu Lake. In the room, there will be various mosquitoes, moths, etc. fly into the room at night, and there are no sand windows in the room.It is hoped that the hotel can improve the above problems and strengthen management.It is worth mentioning that the hotel drove to the city in the afternoon to help or order Yuanzu's Muice cake, which was very moved!When we proposed to use ten chairs at night, there was an old man who sent it to the room twice. Thank you very much!The birthday dinner at the glass restaurant at night is also good, 17 people dishes+wine+Yuanzu cake = 3092 yuan.Overall feels that this hotel is more suitable for the two people's world vacation, department meeting activities, and three or five friends Xiaoju!Supplementary comment on June 23, 2008: In addition, the massage bathtub in the bathroom is very comfortable, but it is great to have an independent shower room!"
1,打开评价页面就很不一样，很少有酒店能这么认真的作评价回复，这一点就很不错了。我们是A9上海至湖州通车那天来湖州逛逛的，定了太湖豪华房，应该算是不错，建筑比较吸引人，不过那天风大雨大就一直在房间里，可能观念的问题吧，就五星标准来说，房间足够大，浴室也做的很漂亮，但却少许多东西，感觉空落落的，床上用品也只有简单的两个枕头、一条薄被，看上去就好冷啊~应该会比较适合夏季度假吧：）由于临时有事，没有过夜就提前退房了，前台mm还很遗憾的说，下次一定要来住哦，听了蛮窝心的，我想应该会在暖和些的日子再来的：）也希望再次入住前酒店能做更好的改进，哈哈补充点评2008年1月17日：关键没有国际卫视，这一点作为五星标准比较令人不能接受：S,"Opening the evaluation page is very different. Few hotels can make such serious evaluation and reply, which is very good.We came to Huzhou on the day of A9 from Shanghai to Huzhou to traffic in Huzhou. We set up the luxury room of Taihu Lake. It should be considered good and the building is more attractive.Say that the room is large enough, and the bathroom is very beautiful, but there are many things. It feels empty. The bedding only has two simple pillows and a thin quilt.Bar :) Because there is something temporarily, check out in advance without overnight. The front desk MM is regrettable. I must come to live next time.I also hope that the hotel can make better improvements before check -in again. Haha supplemented comments on January 17, 2008: The key does not have International TV. This is the five -star standard."
1,"住的是嘉士房,可以在房内泡泡温泉,还不错,","I live in the Garly Family, which can bubble hot springs in the room. It's not bad."
1,提前做了些功课，所以乘坐班车比较方便。虽然周边环境一般，温泉也有在进行施工，但整体感觉还是不错的，走的时候有些不舍。双床房间的床大得夸张，有点象双人床了，就是不明白为什么窗户是上锁的，无法打开。服务人员很礼貌，见到的每个人都面带笑容，主动问好。早餐丰富，尤其是蛋糕很好吃，不过没有补充。中餐量偏小了，不过也可以理解。美中不足的是车费忘记结账的时候出示了，浪费了60元，呵呵。如果结账的时候能够主动提醒一下就更好了。,"Do some homework in advance, so it is more convenient to take a shuttle bus.Although the surrounding environment is average, the hot springs are also under construction, but the overall feeling is still good, and some reluctant when walking.The bed in the double bed is exaggerated, and it is a bit like a double bed. I just don't understand why the window is locked and cannot be opened.The service staff is very polite. Everyone who sees a smile and ask hello.Breakfast is rich, especially the cake is delicious, but it is not added.The amount of Chinese food is small, but it can be understood.The disadvantage of the beauty is that the fare was forgotten at the checkout, which wasted 60 yuan, huh.It would be better if you can take the initiative to remind you at the checkout."
1,离厦门市区太远，酒店没有车接送，自行前往很麻烦。温泉离酒店隔离一条大马路，无法直接前往，很不方便，必须走高架桥或坐酒店电瓶车绕路前往，如果是冬天客人穿衣服去泡温泉就会很麻烦。温泉确实不错，硬件设施比较齐全，但单独收费项目太多，没有在进去之前说明，原来以为酒店昂贵的房间价格包含的温泉票就包括温泉的消费，真正进温泉才知道不是这样，温泉内部大大小小的收费很多的。另外，酒店的服务态度不很友好，特别是财务人员。,"It's too far from Xiamen City, there is no car pickup and drop -off in the hotel, and it is troublesome to go by itself.The hot spring isolated a big road from the hotel. It is not convenient to go directly. It is very inconvenient. You must take a bridge or take a hotel battery car to go around. If it is winter, guests wear clothes to soak the hot spring.The hot spring is really good, the hardware facilities are relatively complete, but there are too many toll items separately. They did not explain before entering. It turned out that the hot spring tickets contained in the expensive room price of the hotel include the consumption of hot springs.There are a lot of sizes.In addition, the hotel's service attitude is not very friendly, especially the financial staff."
1,非常好！一进房间就能闻到一股花得芳香~~~服务态度十分热情~~~酒店里不但有免费得室内室外温泉泡~~而且还送两张188元得温泉泡~~有不下七十多种温泉：如白酒温泉，绿茶温泉等十分不错~~早饭也相当丰盛可以说应有尽有~~鸡翅特别美味~~通过携程预订还送免费得两杯饮料~~~sogood~~是标准得五星酒店~~~如果觉得离市区远了点可以乘班车或打车（40元左右）~~但绝对物超所值~~走时还送了两串玛瑙手机链~~~下次再去厦门一定要再去~~Imissyou！！,"very good!As soon as you enter the room, you can smell a flowering fragrance ~~~ The service attitude is very enthusiastic ~~~ The hotel not only has free indoor outdoor hot spring bubbles ~~ also gives two 188 yuan hot spring bubble ~~A variety of hot springs: such as liquor hot spring, green tea hot spring, etc. are very good ~~ Breakfast is also quite rich. It can be said to have everything ~~ Chicken wings are particularly delicious ~~ Book it through Ctrip and send two free drinks for free ~~~ Sogood ~~ It is a standard five -star hotel.~~~ If you feel far away from the city, you can take a bus or take a taxi (about 40 yuan) ~~ But it is definitely worth it ~~ I also gave two bunch of agate mobile phone chains when I left ~~~ I must go to Xiamen next time.Go ~~ Imissyou!Intersection"
1,最繁华的地段中价位适中的酒店，房间较大，骚扰电话不少。,"The most prosperous hotel in the most prosperous area, the room is large, and there are many harassment calls."
1,入住没什么问题，前台把握安排在23楼，那里可真是馊臭，一出电梯非常难闻。进了房间里面还是有这个味道。就快要吐出来了。实在是忍无可忍，打电话给总台，要求换房。后来换到39楼。服务生说是23，24楼市公寓楼，有人在做饭的。晕！！！也说明酒店不重视携程的客户。如果是他们酒店ACCOR的会员的话，肯定不会安排在23楼。还有个奇怪的问题是，为什么携程总是没有早餐的？什么酒店都没有，感觉是携程吃了我们的早餐。,"There is no problem in check -in. The front desk is arranged on the 23rd floor, where it is really stinky, and it is very unpleasant to get out of the elevator.I still have this taste in the room.It's about to spit it out.It was really unbearable, called the head office and asked for a house to change the house.Later, changed to the 39th floor.The waiter said that it was the 23rd and 24th property apartment buildings. Someone was cooking.faint!IntersectionIntersectionIt also shows that the hotel does not pay attention to Ctrip's customers.If it is a member of the hotel's hotel, it will definitely not be arranged on the 23rd floor.There is also a strange question, why is there always no breakfast in Ctrip?There is no hotel, I feel that Ctrip has eaten our breakfast."
1,酒店周围除了温泉公园基本没啥了。早餐选择很多非常可口，尤其是内带温泉，实在舒服。,"There is basically nothing except the hot spring park.There are many very delicious choices for breakfast, especially in the hot spring, which is really comfortable."
1,刚进入索菲特银座大饭店时就受到了前台小姐热情的接待，她告诉我说通过携程预订的房间都可以免费升级，感觉非常温馨。我的房间被安排在专门的女士楼层，住过这么多的酒店，第一次听说有专门的女士楼层，觉得挺有特色的。房间里有很多好看的女性杂志，还有化妆棉和浴盐呢，最重要的是房间特别高，空气好，视野更好啦，可以看到全济南的建筑呢，大明湖和泉城广场也尽收眼底。下次来济南一定还住在这里......,"When I first entered the Sopht Ginza Hotel, she was warmly received by Miss front desk. She told me that the rooms booked through Ctrip could be upgraded for free, and it felt very warm.My room was arranged on a dedicated lady floor and lived in so many hotels. For the first time, I heard that there are special ladies floors, and I feel quite distinctive.There are many good -looking women's magazines in the room, as well as cotton pads and bath salt. The most important thing is that the room is particularly high, the air is good, and the vision is better. You can see the building in Jinan.View.Next time you come to Jinan, you must still live here ..."
1,房间设施很好，服务很周到．特别是门童和前台，很热情．酒店每晚都征求意见，看有什么不满意的，这是其他酒店没有的．,The room facilities are very good and the service is very thoughtful.Especially the door children and the front desk are very enthusiastic.The hotel solices of opinions every night to see what is not satisfied. This is what other hotels are not.
1,靠马路的房间晚上睡觉有点吵，房间电熨斗给商务客人带来方便。,"The room on the road was a little noisy at night, and the electric iron was convenient for business guests."
1,环境很好，房间不错，网速还可以。早餐不太丰盛，很多都是辣的。选择也不多，看了一圈也没有什么想吃的。饭店离机场较近，饭店后面有超市，美食一条街。,"The environment is very good, the room is good, and the network speed is okay.Breakfast is not too rich, and many of them are spicy.There are not many choices, and there is nothing to eat after watching it.The hotel is closer to the airport. There is a supermarket behind the hotel and a street."
1,"非常不错,下次还住这里,环境非常好,服务也不错","Very good, I still live here next time, the environment is very good and the service is good"
1,刚住了两个美丽华240的贵宾楼感觉有点贵160比较合适吃早餐最好早点去晚了就没了一层的“碘泉”还不错可以去泡泡据德州本地人说那的girl是当,"I just lived in two beautiful VIP buildings that I felt a bit expensive 160. It is better to eat breakfast. It is best to go late and have a layer of ""iodine springs"".when"
1,"从外边看象简易房子,开始以为大堂对面的房子比较好呢,却被告诉对面是多人间,有点想不通.从外观肯定不如北海,看日出也不太方面到光明顶要一小时,狮子林可能稍近一点.服务尚可;补充点评2008年1月14日：写错了前面是写山上北海宾馆,华山宾馆只有位置好,房间大,其它没有别的优势了.","Looking at the simple house from the outside, I thought that the house across the lobby was better, but was told that the opposite side was a multi -person room. It was a bit unreasonable. From the appearance, it was definitely not as good as Beihai.Lin may be a little closer. The service is available; the supplementary review January 14, 2008: The wrong writing is the Writing Mountain Beihai Hotel. Huashan Hotel has only good location, large rooms, and there are no other advantages."
1,国庆期间价格仍旧１８０元，是平易近人的价格。标准房尽管略微陈旧，但东西还是很整洁的，早餐十分的丰富，令人惊讶。而且随行的小孩早餐可以免费，赞！另外，酒店的房间都可以免费上网，速度非常快，再赞！晚餐和夜宵的送餐价格都十分便宜，再赞！还有数字点播电视全部免费，再赞！所以，同行的都说性价比十分高。,"During the National Day, the price is still 180 yuan, which is an approachable price.Although the standard room is slightly old, things are still clean, and breakfast is very rich and surprising.And the accompanying children can breakfast for free, like!In addition, the hotel's rooms can be free to access the Internet, and the speed is very fast, praise again!The price of dinner and supper is very cheap, praise again!There are also digital demand TVs for free, praise again!Therefore, the peers said that the price / performance ratio is very high."
1,酒店大堂比较气派，房间风景也不错，服务也不错。但因为临近中秋节，几乎连行李生都会说“要不要买月饼呀，如果买，一定要找我呀”，我们几出几进，每次基本上都会是这样的问候语，实在有些怪。再就是在酒店打车很不方便，因为在半岛，如果没有人打车进来，就没法叫车去出，特别是下午五六点的时候。,"The hotel lobby is relatively elegant, the room scenery is also good, and the service is good.But because the Mid -Autumn Festival is approaching, almost even the luggage student will say, ""Do you want to buy moon cakes? If you buy it, we must find me."" We are a few times, and we basically have such greetings every time, which is a bit strange.Then it ’s inconvenient to take a taxi at the hotel, because at the peninsula, if no one takes a taxi, it will not be able to call the car out, especially at 5 or 6 pm."
1,走进生态园路口环境比较不错，但往里走有工地在建设，通过了解是由于为了2010年休博会的建造，相信在不久的以后这是一个旅游度假比较不错的地方。酒店房间较宽敞，比较适合居家旅行住宿。酒店服务员服务态度较好，服务很有耐心，本人较感动。本人愿意给朋友介绍此酒店。,"Entering the ecological park intersection environment is relatively good, but there is a construction site in construction. By understanding, it is because of the construction of the 2010 Xiebo.Hotel rooms are more spacious and more suitable for home travel.The hotel waiter has a good service attitude, and the service is very patient. I am more moved.I am willing to introduce this hotel to my friends."
1,"离杭州不少路,酒店特别是晚上不好找,游乐项目不多宾馆反馈2007年3月5日：酒店已增加了园区内电瓶车观光游览、垂钓、各种球类运动项目、射箭、野外拓展、农家土柴灶自己烧、烧烤等等活动。","There are many roads from Hangzhou, the hotel is not easy to find at night, and there are not many hotels for players to feedback March 5, 2007: The hotel has added battery car tourism tour, fishing, various ball movements, archery, field expansion in the park, Farmers' soil stoves, baked, barbecue and so on."
1,1，在香格里拉应该算很好了2，用信用卡不方便（酒店自己有些小心眼，耍个小聪明），做法不厚道。3，绝对值是到不了5星的，但在那个地方，还是可以的4，欧式房间卫生间的设计太傻了！！！5，小花园不错。,"1. In Shangri -La, it should be considered good. 2. It is not convenient to use a credit card (the hotel itself is a little careful, playing with a small clever), and the practice is not kind.3, the absolute value is not 5 stars, but in that place, it can still be 4, the design of the European -style room bathroom is too stupid!IntersectionIntersection5. The small garden is good."
1,相信在香格里拉这么个荒凉的小县城来说，这间酒店相对比较好，餐厅吃得也不算贵。总体来说是算比较舒服的，,"I believe that in such a desolate small county in Shangrira, this hotel is relatively good, and the restaurant is not expensive.Generally speaking, it is more comfortable,"
1,老牌的宾馆，虽然挂4星，但不如赵王宾馆，价格竞争力不大。另外：房费不含早餐，非常难以理解！,"Although the old hotel, although it is hung by 4 stars, it is not as good as the Zhao Wang Hotel.In addition: The room fee does not include breakfast, it is very difficult to understand!"
1,第二天下午退房的话，第二天房价算一半，这点很实惠。贵宾南楼标间260一天，算是还可以。一楼在装修，有点吵。,"If you check out the next afternoon, the house price is half the next day, which is very affordable.The VIP Nanlou Bid 260 One day, it is okay.The first floor was decorated, a little noisy."
1,花园式酒店，卫生情况还可以，房间配置一般；周边环境比较热闹，闹中取静。夜间有骚扰电话，不好,"Garden -style hotels, hygiene is okay, the room configuration is average; the surrounding environment is relatively lively, and it is quiet in trouble.There are harassment calls at night, not good"
1,服务不错，始终有笑容。房间很干净，卫生间洗脸台太小。,"The service is good and always smiles.The room was very clean, and the bathroom washing the face was too small."
1,是携程在驻马店的唯一签约酒店，感觉有这一个也足够了。据称是当地唯一一家四星酒店，感觉确实算是当地最好的酒店了，主楼的硬件还可以。地理位置对于自驾车来说，还算比较便利。给携程的价格也不错，是门市价的四点五折。以268的价格入住主楼，性价比挺高的。就是用网线还要花20元，有点小家子气。,"It is Ctrip's only signing hotel in Zhumadian, and it feels enough to have this.It is said that it is the only four -star hotel in the local area. It feels really the best local hotel. The hardware of the main building is OK.Geographical location is relatively convenient for self -driving.The price for Ctrip is also good, it is 45 % of the store price.Check in the main building at a price of 268, which is very cost -effective.It costs 20 yuan to use the network cable, a little bit of anger."
1,入住当天，房间没打扫好等了一个多小时，迎宾项链，茶水和毛巾都没送。我们在泳池边休息时点的烤肉串又硬又老，当我们提出冷了可否再烤一时，服务生竟然以厨房太忙没空一口回绝。失望！,"On the day of staying, the room was not cleaned for more than an hour. Welcome necklaces, tea and towels were not delivered.The barbecue skewers at the rest of the swimming pool were hard and old. When we proposed that it was cold, we could bake it for a while, and the waiter was too busy with the kitchen.disappointment!"
1,"我们四号入住万豪的行政豪华海景房,感觉很好.首先从大堂的感觉就很舒服,之前在网上看到有人评论说办理入住手续慢,对待外国客人要比中国人热情以及忘记送冰毛巾,欢迎项链和饮料的情况都不存在,我们很满意.第一晚的马桶出了些状况,不过服务员很快就把卫生间搞定了,相当满意.泳池1.2米,不过适合我,不会游泳.海滩的沙子很细软,工作人员也很负责,总之到处都能感受到5星服务的标准.所以的服务员也都很热情.虽然不错,不过我们下次要试一下丽滋酒店,呵呵.....没有比较,就没有鉴别嘛!","We stayed at the administrative luxury seascape room on the 4th of us No. 4 and felt very good. First of all, the feeling of the lobby was very comfortable. Before I saw someone commented on the Internet, it was slow to check in. Treatment of foreign guests was more enthusiastic than the Chinese and forgot to send ice towels to send ice towels to send ice towels.Welcome to the necklace and drinks. We are very satisfied. The first night of the toilet was in some situation, but the waiter quickly got the bathroom, which was quite satisfied. The swimming pool was 1.2 meters, but it was suitable for me to swim.The sand on the beach is very soft, and the staff is also responsible. In short, you can feel the standard of 5 -star service everywhere. Therefore, the waiters are also very enthusiastic. Although it is good, we will try to try the Liri Hotel next time, haha ..... No comparison, there is no identification!"
1,我是8月7日从银泰换酒店入住到万豪的。一进万豪的大门，就喜欢上了万豪，下车到了大堂，我就更加喜欢了，小孩子开心的到处看，真的非常豪华的酒店大堂，太喜欢了。我预定的是行政海景房，海景漂亮，下面的游泳池也非常棒！房间里的设施也非常好，床比银泰的大多了，睡着也舒服。早餐也非常丰富，不错，非常不错。中餐厅的古筝非常舒服，边吃边听，享受哦~下次还会去万豪，也会极力向朋友推荐万豪的！,"I stayed from Intime 7 on August 7 to Marriott.As soon as I entered the door of Marriott, I fell in love with Marriott. When I got out of the car and got to the lobby, I liked it even more. The children were happy to see everywhere. It is really a luxurious hotel lobby. I like it so much.I have to book an administrative sea view room. The sea view is beautiful, and the swimming pool below is also great!The facilities in the room are also very good. The bed is more than Intime, and it is comfortable to fall asleep.Breakfast is also very rich, good, very good.The Guzheng of the Chinese restaurant is very comfortable."
1,酒店环境很好，大堂很有气势，本人即使入住园景房也能见海，服务人员很客气，一点瑕疵：房间的马桶未见品牌，进水时间过长且有明显声响。,"The hotel environment is very good, and the lobby is very imposing. I can see the sea even if I stay in the garden view room. The service staff are very polite. A little flaw: The toilet in the room has no brand, and the water in the water is too long and there is obvious noise."
1,2006年10月３日住的，感觉非常好！性价比很好，硬件设施，软件服务都非常的不错，交通也很便利，周围环境，酒店院内环境很好，距离海边很近，早晚散步很舒适，卫生间很大，是个非常不错的适合休闲度假的五星级酒店！,"I lived on October 3, 2006 and felt very good!The price is good, hardware facilities, software services are very good, and the transportation is also very convenient. The surrounding environment, the environment in the hotel is very good, very close to the seaside. It is very comfortable to walk in the morning and evening.five star hotel!"
1,宾馆无论是外部环境，还是房间里面环境都不错。就是我们同事房间的淋浴房有溢水。一直也没人修。其他真的不错。房间＆浴室都很干净，家具＆洁具也都很干净。就是电视频道太少了。,"The hotel is good in the external environment or the environment in the room.It is the shower room in our colleagues' rooms.No one has been repairing.The others are really good.The room & bathrooms are very clean, and the furniture & sanitary ware is also very clean.There are too few TV channels."
1,非常不错。来长沙必住的酒店！没什么说的，一切都不错，尤其是对着马路的全景房，真的很好,"very good.Come to the hotel in Changsha!Nothing to say, everything is good, especially the panoramic room facing the road, it is really good"
1,都说长沙饭店老，服务态度不行，不过这次在五华感觉还蛮好。1.定的商务大床间，在25楼，落地窗感觉不错，外面就是贯穿长沙市南北的芙蓉中路；房间好大的，床差不多7尺，睡得很香；关于隔音情况，隔壁电视机声音确实会传过来，有点影响睡眠，不过这似乎是通病；2.早餐自助数量不能说多，但过得去，味道也可以，汤面和荷包蛋都是现做的，总体来说符合四星级标准。只是冷饮料只有一种果汁，味道虽不错，但不太合我的口味，希望改善；3.房间和卫生间是一块透明玻璃隔断，遮帘还是房间里控制的，呵呵，年轻人应该很喜欢。4.酒店位置属于长沙市偏南了，不属于市中心，交通路线不少但是很乱，老实说长沙的交通路线大多数都是绕路的，很不合理。不过幸好市区不大，到东到西打的也蛮便宜。询问前台小姐去岳麓书院的公交，也说不出个所以然，晕死；5.最好想说的是，房间工作台上的矿泉水是付费的，只有柜子里2瓶才是免费的，容易让房客搞错，这点有必要提出，呵呵。补充点评2008年6月11日：对了，电视机换台时画面居然会停滞片刻，非常奇怪。还有茶包，居然放绿茶的小竹篮上写着“有偿使用”，差点上当！总而言之，房间还是蛮干净的，设施也比较齐全。,"It is said that the Changsha Hotel is old and the service attitude is not good, but this time in Wuhua feels pretty good.1. The big business room, on the 25th floor, the floor -to -ceiling window feels good. The outside is the Furong Middle Road that runs through the north and south of Changsha; the room is so big that the bed is almost 7 feet and sleeps very fragrant.It will indeed be passed over, which affects sleep, but this seems to be a common problem; 2. The number of breakfast buffets cannot be said, but it can be passed and the taste is OK. The soup noodles and poached eggs are all made. Generally, it meets the four -star standard.It ’s just that there is only one kind of juice in cold drinks. Although the taste is good, it does n’t fit my taste and wants to improve it. 3. The room and bathroom are a transparent glass partition, the curtain is controlled in the room, haha, young people should like it very much.4. The location of the hotel is south of Changsha City. It does not belong to the city center. There are many transportation routes but chaotic. To be honest, most of the traffic routes in Changsha are detouring, which is unreasonable.Fortunately, the urban area is not large, and it is quite cheap to go east to west.Ask the bus from the front desk to go to Yuelu Academy, and I can't tell why, faint; 5. It is best to say that the mineral water on the room workbench is paid. Only 2 bottles in the cabinet are free.It is necessary to make a mistake, it is necessary to propose it, haha.Supplementary comment on June 11, 2008: By the way, the picture will be stagnant for a moment when the TV changes, which is very strange.There are also tea bags. The small bamboo basket that actually placed green tea reads ""paid use"", almost fooled!All in all, the room is quite clean and the facilities are relatively complete."
1,客房设施很不错，价格也很适中，令客人住的很舒服，服务态度也令人满意，就是在电视收看方面还需进一步改进。,"The guest room facilities are very good, the price is very moderate, which makes guests live very comfortably, and the service attitude is satisfactory. It needs to be improved further in TV watching."
1,"房间很大,床很硬,淋浴的操作是很奇怪的设计.周边的超市很多,奇怪的是酒店内的商场很晚开门却早早就关门了,好象不是为酒店住客服务的.","The room is very large, the bed is very hard, the shower operation is very strange design. There are many supermarkets around. Strangely, the shopping mall in the hotel is very late but closed early, as if it is not for the hotel residents."
1,不错，卫生间够大，还奇怪为什么要这么大空间，呵呵。只是被单和床单上有些印迹没洗掉，不脏但看着不是很舒服，其它都还OK,"Yes, the bathroom is big enough, and it is strange why it is so big, haha.It was just washed away by the single and sheets. It was not dirty but it was not very comfortable. Others were OK."
1,房间比较大，但是酒店的附属设施洗浴中心虽说楼层比较多，但是基础设施太差，只有淋浴和桑拿，连浴池,"The room is relatively large, but although the hotel's auxiliary facilities bathing centers are more floors, the infrastructure is too poor, only shower and sauna, and even baths"
1,住过好几次的宾馆了，总体感觉不错，虽然离繁华地带远一些，但是个休息的好地方。餐厅的晚餐还不错。,"The hotels that have been stayed several times, the overall feels good. Although it is a little farther away from the bustling land, it is a good place to rest.The dinner in the restaurant is not bad."
1,7月底入住的总体来说3星级的能做到这样已经很不容易了比较干净感觉也很温馨服务态度也很好只是6楼还有蚊子....地方略微小了些不过还是很满意的,"Generally speaking, the 3 -star can be done in the end of July. It is not easy to be so clean. I feel very warm. The attitude is very good. It ’s very good. It’ s the 6th floor. There are mosquitoes on the 6th floor .... The place is slightly smaller.of"
1,青山湖度假酒店的环境是第一流的！我已经住了三次了，还是向往这个温馨的地方。山水之美实在令人难忘。只是酒店的设施有点老了，但还算舒适！酒店餐厅的菜式也不错。总的来说，环境一流、服务一流、设施、管理和员工的训练水平只能算二流啦！,"The environment of the Qingshan Lake Resort is the first!I have lived three times and still yearn for this warm place.The beauty of the landscape is really unforgettable.It's just that the hotel's facilities are a bit old, but it's pretty comfortable!The restaurant of the hotel is also good.In general, the level of environmental first -class, first -class service, facilities, management and employees can only be counted as two streams!"
1,从上海出发，沪杭高速，杭州绕城北线，西线，杭徽高速，临安出口下，右转弯后第一个红绿灯（加油站）左转，市标转盘处有一条小马路直走就到了。环境很好，度假的好去处。,"Starting from Shanghai, Shanghai -Hangzhou Expressway, the northern line of Hangzhou, the western line, the Hangzhou -Hui Expressway, under the exit of Lin'an, the first traffic light (gas station) left after the right turn left.arrive.The environment is very good, a good place for vacation."
1,环境真的非常棒，但去之前要和前台约好湖景房，否则另一侧的房子景观太差。房间内还是有些异味，可能前面入住的客人抽烟造成的吧。早餐9：00结束，太早，睡个懒觉就没有饭吃了。从上海出发，可以直接从杭州绕城转到航徽高速，临安出口下，右转弯后第一个红绿灯左转就差不多到了。顺便提一下，该酒店的指示牌特别不清楚，要非常小心，以免走错路。,"The environment is really great, but before going to the front desk, you have to make an appointment with the lake view room, otherwise the house landscape on the other side is too bad.The room is still a little odor, it may be caused by the guests who stayed in the front.The breakfast ends at 9:00, too early, and I do n’t have a meal when I sleep.Starting from Shanghai, you can turn directly from Hangzhou to the Hang Hui Expressway. Under the exit of Lin'an. After the right turn, the first red and green light turns left to the left.By the way, the hotel's sign is particularly unclear, so be careful to avoid the wrong way."
1,前台接待人员态度比较生硬，客户服务人员的态度比较好（比较耐心解释）。另外对预定的火车票没有及时反馈（12日晚预定13日的火车票，总台人员13日上午未及时通知我定不到票）。,"The attitude of the front desk reception staff is relatively stiff, and the attitude of the customer service staff is better (more patient explanation).In addition, there was no timely feedback on the scheduled train ticket (the train ticket was scheduled to be scheduled to be on the evening of the 12th, and the general station personnel failed to notify me in time on the morning of the 13th)."
1,性价比极高，服务好！来这酒店之前，我刚在温州一家380.00/晚的酒店住过，比这差多了，尤其服务不及这家。强烈推荐！,"The price is very high, the service is good!Before I came to this hotel, I just lived in a 380.00/evening hotel in Wenzhou, which was much worse than this, especially in this house.highly recommended!"
1,酒店设施尚可但是服务未达五星标准携程的价格缺乏竞争力,The hotel facilities are still available but the price of not reaching five -star standard Ctrip lacks competitiveness
1,一般。距离五星级的标准还有差距。当然价格也便宜些。位置不太好。床不舒服。有点硬。,"generally.There is still a gap between the five -star standard.Of course, the price is cheaper.The position is not good.The bed is uncomfortable.A little hard."
1,酒店很不错，硬件很好。自助餐厅早、中、晚都有很方便。性价比很高！,"The hotel is very good and the hardware is good.The buffet restaurant is very convenient in the morning, middle and evening.The price / performance is very high!"
1,一家很不错道酒店，无论软件硬件都比较理想，离市区并不算太远，在重庆繁华的大都市能住到这样好道酒店非常满意，重要的是价格也不贵。,"The family is very good, whether the software and hardware are ideal, it is not too far from the city. It is very satisfied with such a good hotel in the bustling metropolis in Chongqing. The important thing is that the price is not expensive."
1,"很好的商务酒店,周围环境清幽,房间里面干净舒适,周围出入和吃饭都很方便,价格非常合理,是去重庆公干的必去的酒店.","A very good business hotel, the surrounding environment is quiet, the room is clean and comfortable, it is very convenient to go around and eat around, the price is very reasonable, it is a must -visit hotel for Chongqing public."
1,然市中心了些~（可是，坐地很方便的~）但是如果你在四~五周事情的~是不的~一般和司直接酒店的名字~司傅不知道在哪里~打的去的，得在慈云的西北角~以前的那里~有大的~酒店的整施,"However, the city center is some ~ (but it is very convenient to sit on the ground ~) But if you are in four to five weeks ~ No ~ Generally, the name of the direct hotel of He Si ~ Si Fu don’t know where it is ~You have to be in the northwest corner of Ciyun ~ Previously ~ there is a large ~ the whole of the hotel"
1,房间装修挺新，设施不错，配备电脑上网，就是网速有些慢，还有免费的VOD视频点播，卫生间也不错；酒店位置离九华街中心稍远，但是自驾的就很合适；总之在九华山上这家酒店还是值得推荐，下次还会住那儿。,"The room decoration is new, the facilities are good, and the computer access the Internet is a bit slow, and there are free VOD video on demand, and the bathroom is also good; the hotel location is slightly far from the center of Jiuhua Street, but it is very suitable for self -driving. In shortThis hotel on Huashan is still recommended, and I will live there next time."
1,设施较新，服务员的态度也不错，带我们看房，还很爽快地按照我们的要求给换了景观较好的房间，热情地解答我们各样的问题，门口的保安也是热情地帮我们找来汽车修理人员，解决我们车子遇到的突发问题。唯一的缺憾就是所在的地点略偏远了一点，附近吃饭不是很方便，要走十多分钟到老街，更适合自驾游者。,"The facilities are relatively new, and the waiter's attitude is also good. Take us to see the house. It is also very refreshing to change the room with better landscapes according to our requirements.Come to the car repair personnel to solve the sudden problems encountered by our car.The only regret is that the location is slightly remote. It is not very convenient to eat nearby. It is more suitable for self -driving tourists for more than ten minutes."
1,整体感觉都还不错~~~服务也还可以就是洗手间比别的锦江要差,The overall feeling is pretty good ~~~ The service can also be that the toilet is worse than other Jinjiang
1,很好房间很好位置很不错以后还会入住,"Very good room, good room, very good location, very good, I will stay in the future"
1,"地理位置不错,房间对着中央大街,隔音玻璃还不错,街上的声音房间里听不到.需要提高的是卫生间里卫生纸的质量,实在太差.而且卫生纸快没了,也没有及时补充.早饭还不错,但橙汁是冲泡的,估计是果珍之类,而不是纯果汁.品种还算丰富.","The geographical location is good. The room is facing the Central Street. The sound insulation glass is not bad. The sound of the room can not be heard in the room. The quality of toilet paper in the bathroom needs to be improved. It is too bad. And the toilet paper is almost gone, and it is not supplemented in time.Breakfast is pretty good, but orange juice is brewed, it is estimated to be fruit treasure, not pure fruit juice. The variety is rich."
1,酒店就在中央大街上，到松花江和索菲亚大教堂只需要步行就可以了，就冲着这一点定的。酒店挺老的，虽然性价比不是很高，但是房间重新装修过了，还是比较舒适的。如果只玩市中心，这里还是不错的选择。,"The hotel is on the Central Street. It only needs to walk to the Songhua River and the Sophia Cathedral, and it is settled at this point.The hotel is very old. Although the cost performance is not very high, the room has been renovated and it is relatively comfortable.If you only play the city center, it is still a good choice here."
1,谢谢了！携程刚刚离开江西庐山回家。日前，单位工作繁重，刚处理完几件要事，到庐山边休闲边写点东西拟定下一步公司发展战略。受九江朋友推荐，7月14日，通过携程订了电力宾馆的贵宾楼，晚上要写纲要，需要上网查东西，那里有免费电脑上网，很方便，我在庐山以前也住过几次，虽然硬件条件各有千秋，而该宾馆的软件服务其他饭店是无法比的，亲情化服务处处体现。在我自驾车上庐山，沿途就有很多导游叫我去别的地方住，我知道她们又会带着我去别的宾馆拿回扣，加上我已经预订了宾馆，于是电话联系了电力宾馆，宾馆说可以到北山园门口接我，由于开车较慢，路上又堵车，比跟他们约定的时间晚了将近40分钟，可他们还在那里等候，一到宾馆，到处都见服务员笑脸，让我感觉到了家。环境优美、安静，房间卫生干净。尤其值得一提的是宾馆的餐饮上乘，这与日常大家想象的宾馆饭菜截然不同。7月15日晚上我安排了一桌饭，宴请九江几个赶上来聚会的朋友，结账时发现价格适中，有一个庐山的朋友说比外面小餐馆饭菜还要卫生、便宜，300元一桌满满的各种鱼和九江风味土菜，让朋友们食欲犹浓，干掉了我6瓶四特酒。当然感受最深的还是他们的服务，宾馆那个李副理自始至终中问寒问暖，关心我们的需求，家的感觉油然而生，7月15日晚上酒喝太多，材料没写成，好在住这里跟家里没什么区别，第二天又续住一晚！原来认为电力部门是老大思想，服务不佳，但在他们庐山疗养院，感觉却是别有洞天！,"Thank you!Ctrip just left Lushan, Jiangxi to go home.A few days ago, the unit had a heavy work. I just finished handling a few things. Write something to formulate the next company's development strategy while writing to Lushan.Recommended by Jiujiang's friends, on July 14, the VIP building of the Electric Power Hotel was ordered through Ctrip. I need to write an outline at night. I need to check things online. There is a free computer to access the Internet. It is very convenient.The hardware conditions have their own advantages, and other restaurants in the hotel are incomparable. Familiar services are reflected everywhere.When I drove to Lushan, there were a lot of tour guides asking me to live in other places. I know that they will take me to other hotels to get back the buckle. In addition, I have already reserved the hotel, so I called the Electric Hotel.The hotel said that he could pick me up at the gate of Beishan Garden. Due to the slow driving, the road was traffic jams, which was almost 40 minutes later than the appointment agreed with them.Feeling home.The environment is beautiful and quiet, and the room is hygienic.It is particularly worth mentioning that the hotel's superior food and beverage is very different from the daily hotels that everyone imagine.On the evening of July 15th, I arranged a table of meals to invite a few friends who caught up with Jiujiang to meet the party. I found that the price was moderate at checkout. A friend of Lushan said that it was more hygienic and cheap than the meals outside the small restaurant outside.All kinds of fish and Jiujiang flavored soil dishes have made my friends' appetite, killing my 6 bottles of four special wines.Of course, the deepest feeling is their service. The deputy manager Li of the hotel asked Han and asked warmly from the beginning to the end.Always stay one night the next day!It turned out that the power department was the boss's thoughts and poor services, but in their Lushan Sanatorium, I felt that there was a cave!"
1,房间感觉一般，没有很好，但也谈不上差。我是因为那里离开目的地近所以选的,"The room feels average, not very good, but it is not bad.I chose it because I left the destination there, so I chose it"
1,老酒店了，几近换主，目前还不错，尤其是价格太实惠了,"Old hotels, I have changed the Lord almost, it's not bad, especially the price is too affordable"
1,订的标房没了，酒店给免费升到了套房。有点老旧，卫生间小。其它方面还行。早餐非常好，还有味道很棒的兰州拉面。,"The booked benchmark is gone, and the hotel has risen to the suite for free.It's a bit old, and the bathroom is small.Other aspects are OK.The breakfast is very good, and there is a great Lanzhou ramen."
1,对于有车族来说，的确比较方便。免费停车。环境绿化的确好，不论别墅周围，还是东方绿舟。客房内设施还算可以，家具以蓝花布点缀。备有睡衣。有免费小瓶水供应。淋浴热水器旁写着每人都要等1小时，实际用下来并非这么差，至少6月初的季节如此。早餐丰盛，比较满意。餐厅晚餐较贵，但也懒得跑远路寻找别处。建议：一定要租自行车，因为公园实在太大了。免费的1小时不够用。遗憾：体育馆、游泳馆是关着的，不知什么原因。安排入住的房间朝向差，看不到景观。,"It is indeed convenient for the car people.Free parking.The environmental greening is really good, whether around the villa or the East Green Boat.The facilities in the room are okay, and the furniture is embellished with blue flower cloth.Prepare pajamas.There is a free small bottle of water supply.The shower water heater is written by everyone for 1 hour. It is not so bad to use it, at least in the early June season.Breakfast is rich and satisfied.Dining dinner is more expensive, but too lazy to run away to find elsewhere.Suggestion: Be sure to rent a bicycle, because the park is too big.Free 1 hour is not enough.Unfortunately: The gymnasium and the swimming pool are closed, for some reason.The room where the check -in is worse, and the landscape cannot be seen."
1,我经常住在西藏大厦，主要出差的方便，周围的饭店也比较熟悉了，还有一个物美大卖场；去首场机场相对较方便。,I often live in the Tibetan Building. The main business is convenient. The restaurants around me are also familiar. There is also a Wumi hypermarket; it is relatively convenient to go to the first airport.
1,这是我住过的这一级别的级别的酒店感觉最舒服的。虽然大厅及外部没有那么华丽，但是房间干净、舒适，而且服务也比较好。下次我还会住这个酒店。,"This is the most comfortable hotel I have lived in this level of hotels I have lived.Although the hall and outside are not so gorgeous, the room is clean, comfortable, and better service.Next time I will stay in this hotel."
1,总体感觉还算不错环境也还算可以下次有机会可能还来,"Overall feels good, the environment is still possible to have a chance next time, it may come back"
1,我在尼斯住了5天，价格不是很贵，服务比较细腻，早餐也比较丰富，感觉还是不错。,"I lived in Nice for 5 days. The price is not very expensive, the service is more delicate, the breakfast is rich, and it feels good."
1,总体感觉不错，但是携程的价格优势并不明显，与前台价只差三块钱。再有，该酒店的早餐品种和质量难符四星之名。,"Overall feels good, but the price advantage of Ctrip is not obvious, and it is only three dollars from the front desk price.Furthermore, the hotel's breakfast variety and quality are difficult to conquer the name of the four stars."
1,这次国庆节去住的，感觉不错。房间较大，且比较干净。还有一个小池，里面有鱼，早餐后喂喂鱼还是蛮好的！就是院子小了些，出门也蛮方便的，可以很近的走到海华广场。,"It feels good to live on National Day.The room is large and clean.There is also a small pond with fish inside. It is pretty good to feed fish after breakfast!That is, the yard is smaller, and it is quite convenient to go out. You can go to Haihua Plaza very close."
1,"床特硬,被子感觉有点潮,看了很多网站,的确如别人说的赣州就它一家4星的酒店,没的选.不过就它硬件设施,也就个大城市2星的酒店吧.","The bed is hard, and the quilt feels a bit tide. After watching a lot of websites, it is indeed like someone else said that Ganzhou is a 4 -star hotel, but it does not choose. However, it ’s a hotel in a big city of 2 stars in its hardware facilities."
1,"从性价比来讲还是较高的，房间设施、整体感觉、服务及地段都是基本没有可挑剔，卧室虽小，但也不失温馨，值得继续入住。行李员殷勤程度6星。宾馆反馈2008年8月13日：尊敬的客人,您好！感谢您对本酒店提出的中肯意见，本酒店十分重视，对于您遗忘在房间里的充电器，酒店已于当天托付快递公司快递给您，真诚的感谢您提出的宝贵意见，欢迎您再次入住我们酒店！谢谢！","In terms of cost -effectiveness, it is still high. The room facilities, overall feelings, services, and location are basically not picky. Although the bedroom is small, it is also warm and worthy of continuing to stay.The luggage staff is attentive to 6 stars.Hotel feedback on August 13, 2008: Dear guests, hello!Thank you for your opinion on the hotel's opinion. The hotel attaches great importance to it. For the charger you forgotten in the room, the hotel has been entrusted to the courier company to express it for you on the same day.

1,房间还不错，交通也比较方便，可以考虑以后继续入住,"The room is not bad, and the transportation is more convenient. You can consider staying in the future"
1,因为要去芭洲会展中心，就定了这个酒店，感觉设施比较新，服务挺周到。唯一遗憾的是早餐的时候，有个烤面包机，面包在机器传动带上移动着烤，最后会掉在桌面上，虽然酒店放置了一张纸垫在下面，但总觉得不是太妥当，改进一下会更好。,"Because I want to go to the Papua Convention and Exhibition Center, I set this hotel. I feel that the facilities are relatively new and the service is very thoughtful.The only regret is that during breakfast, there is a bakery machine, the bread is dripped on the machine transmission belt, and it will finally fall on the desktop. Although the hotel is placed belowwill be better."
1,看了携程的评分不错，选择这家酒店。5月10日入住电脑商务房，服务非常体贴周到。电脑，网络，传真和打印机，一应俱全，为工作带来极大便利。在楼下大厅见客户，还热情提供茶水。另外，早餐38元相当不错。下次一定还选择这家酒店。,"After watching Ctrip's score, I chose this hotel.Check in computer business houses on May 10th, and the service is very thoughtful.Computers, networks, faxes and printers are all available, bringing great convenience to work.Seeing customers in the lobby downstairs, and also enthusiastically provided tea.In addition, breakfast is 38 yuan pretty good.Next time, you must choose this hotel."
1,入住感想如下：找不到5星级宾馆的感觉、总体水平最多只能算4星级。虽然房价比中州皇冠便宜100元左右、但所有硬件及软件远不及中州皇冠。,"The feeling of check -in is as follows: I can't find the feeling of 5 -star hotels. The overall level can only be counted as 4 stars.Although house prices are about 100 yuan cheaper than Zhongzhou Crown, all hardware and software are far less than the Crown of Zhongzhou."
1,5月14日入住了这家酒店，服务确实很好，前台会亲自带领客人到房间，并介绍房间设施，得知我自带电脑，立刻把网线从房间内电脑上拆下，放在桌旁待用。晚上六点后会送果盘和小礼物，那天是香蕉和小西红柿，两个毛绒公仔。房间相较其他济南同价位的酒店显得新，很干净，位置也很好！推荐！,"I stayed at this hotel on May 14th. The service was really good. The front desk would lead the guests to the room and introduce the room facilities. I learned that I brought my own computer and immediately removed the network line from the computer in the room and placed it on the table by the table.stand-by.After 6 pm, the fruit plate and small gift will be given. That day was banana and small tomatoes, two plush dolls.The room looks new, clean, and good in the same price of Jinan!recommend!"
1,酒店位置确实很好，紧临泉城广场，与银座购物中心隔街相对。服务也是名不虚传，接待等候有毛巾和茶水服务，进入房间有水果和小礼品。唯有一点不快：收取的3%服务费在携程上没有交待，加床收了100元而不是携程上说的80元。,"The location of the hotel is really good. It is close to Quancheng Square, opposite the streets of the Ginza Shopping Center.The service is also well -known, receiving waiting for towels and tea services, and entering the room with fruits and small gifts.Only a little unpleasant: the 3%service fee charged was not explained on the Ctrip, and the bed was collected 100 yuan instead of 80 yuan said on the Ctrip."
1,第二次入住，酒店的服务还是一如既往地好！入住的时候，一杯香浓的咖啡立即奉上（冬天是姜茶（喝过），夏天据说是酸梅糖）；在前台要求借用电熨斗和熨衣板，结果人到六楼的时候，服务员已经送到房门口等了；开夜床的时候有送果盘，上次入住的时候被送过小毛绒玩具，这次没有发现，就问服务员，结果解释是一天送小公仔，一天送巧克力，当天送的是巧克力；由于我这次只住一天，就试着问服务员能不能给换一下，没想到服务员马上就给了两个，而且巧克力照样留给了我，真是温馨啊。,"For the second time, the hotel's service is still as good as ever!When staying in, a cup of fragrant coffee immediately served (winter tea (drink) in winter, it is said to be sour plum sugar in summer); when the front desk is required to borrow electric iron and ironing board. As a result, when the person on the sixth floor, the waiterI have been sent to the door of the room and waited; when I opened the night bed, there was a fruit plate. I was sent to a small plush toy when I was in my last time. I didn't find it this time. Ask the waiter.It was given chocolate that day; because I only stayed for one day this time, I tried to ask the waiter if I could change it. I did not expect that the waiter would give it two immediately, and the chocolate was left to me. It was really warm."
1,位置离机场很近，比较安静。房间大，温泉泡澡不错，而且有温水泳池，建议带上泳衣。早餐品种多，服务周到。在郑州，算好的酒店。,"The location is very close to the airport and relatively quiet.The room is large, the hot spring bath is good, and there are warm water pools. It is recommended to bring a swimsuit.There are many breakfast varieties and thoughtful service.In Zhengzhou, a good hotel."
1,总体感觉性价比较高，很适合拖家带口出游居住，房间比较干净，服务员都很热情，游泳池不错，小孩子玩得很开心。只是我们住的套房有个卫生间的门不能锁，需要派人在门口站岗，有点搞笑。,"The overall feeling is relatively cost -effective, it is very suitable for dragging home to live, the room is relatively clean, the waiters are very enthusiastic, the swimming pool is good, and the children are very happy.However, there is a bathroom door that we live in the suites that cannot be locked, and we need to send someone to stand at the door, which is a bit funny."
1,也住过些公寓酒店，这家算是严格意义上的了。房间内的设施很齐，厨房和洗衣机等不是虚设的，装修标准不低，虽是2004年开业，但不显陈旧。一家六口，住了行政套房，很满意。泳池很特色，老人小孩都喜欢。,"I have also lived in some apartment hotels, which is considered a strict sense.The facilities in the room are very complete. The kitchen and washing machine are not fixed. The decoration standards are not low. Although it is opened in 2004, it is not old.A family of six, lived in administrative suite, was very satisfied.The pool is very distinctive, and the old people and children like it."
1,客厅很大，房间面积也可以，我们订的是一套三房二厅，一套二房二厅，入住的时候可能二房二厅的房间没有了，给了二套一模一样的房间，只是其中一套锁了一间。除了客厅和主卧外，另二间都没有电视。空调是独立的，很响，晚上只能关了才能入睡。房间设施一般，因为之前住过西安的馨乐庭公寓酒店，二个地方对比下来，就发觉相差不少，很多人性化的细节处都没有馨乐庭做得好。比如：室内电器设备的使用，馨乐庭有一本很祥细的使用说明，参照上面的介绍，很方便的就可以使用，而在和乔丽晶要自己试验，这样对客人和酒店都不方便，万一客人不小心弄坏了，大家都有损失。,"The living room is very large, and the area of the room is also available. We order a three -bedroom and two -living room, a two -bedroom and two -living room. When you stay in, you may be gone in the second room and the second hall.Lock one.Except for the living room and the master bedroom, there are no TVs.The air conditioner is independent and very loud. It can only be turned off at night to fall asleep.The room facilities are average. Because I have lived in the Xinle Ting Apartment Hotel in Xi'an before, the two places are compared to find that there is a lot of difference. Many humanized details have not done well.For example: the use of indoor electrical equipment, Xinle Ting has a very detailed instructions. With reference to the above introduction, it is very convenient to use it. It is not convenient for guests and hotels with Qiao Lijing.A guest accidentally damaged, and everyone lost."
1,又一次来到东胜海天酒店，比第一次的感觉更温馨，更舒适，嗯，很不错。,"I came to Dongsheng Haitian Hotel again, which was more warm and more comfortable than the first time. Well, very good."
1,酒店环境很好就是有一点点偏交通不是很便利去哪都需要达车关键是不好打酒店应该想办法解决一下,"The hotel environment is very good, but a little bit of transportation is not very convenient to go anywhere, the key to get the car is not good to play the hotel. You should find a way to solve it."
1,房间比中州皇冠之类的大多了，服务也还可以；早餐太次，品种太少。此外，房间装修在细节性方面有待改进，尤其是门框等木质装饰，实在不像5星级别。,"Most of the rooms are more than the Crown of Zhongzhou, and the service is okay; the breakfast is too much, and there are too few varieties.In addition, the decoration of the room needs to be improved in detail, especially the wooden decoration such as the door frame, which is not like a 5 -star level."
1,订的是豪华大床房，到那里后豪华房已经没有了，免费升级到行政大床房。过程中服务的态度还好，就是手续有点繁复，行政房需要到22层checkin除了行政房上网free，其他房间上网需要40元/小时80元/一天，免费升级到行政房上网也需要付费。之前住过豪华双人房，感觉和行政大床房没有太大差别，房间大小和装修差不多。这家宾馆最舒服的一点就是浴室比一般宾馆大。总体来说，住过这家宾馆两次，装修和房间大小包括浴室在内，在上海四星级宾馆里来说还算不错的。,"The luxury bed room is booked. After arriving there, the luxury room is gone, and it will be upgraded to the administrative large bed room for free.In the process, the service attitude is good, that is, the procedures are a bit complicated. In addition to the administrative house, the administrative house needs to go to the 22nd floor. In addition to the administrative house on the Internet, other rooms need to be 40 yuan/hour 80 yuan/one day. It also needs to pay for free upgrading to the administrative house.I have lived in a luxurious double room before, and I feel that it is not much different from the administrative bedroom. The size of the room is similar to the decoration.The most comfortable point of this hotel is that the bathroom is larger than ordinary hotels.Overall, I have lived in this hotel twice. The decoration and room size includes the bathroom. It is pretty good in Shanghai four -star hotels."
1,房间还算不错，窗户设计的不错，视野很宽阔！住在高层之上，可以远眺上海的夜景！宽带费太贵了，每小时40元！,"The room is pretty good, the window design is good, and the field of vision is wide!Living above the high -level, you can overlook the night view of Shanghai!Broadband is too expensive, 40 yuan per hour!"
1,"房间比较舒服,酒店的地理位置也比较好.但是宽带收费太贵~","The room is relatively comfortable, and the geographical location of the hotel is better. But the broadband charges are too expensive ~"
1,酒店设施不算新，但是服务很周到。性价比还是很不错的。老外经常会选择这家宾馆。,"The hotel facilities are not new, but the service is very thoughtful.The cost performance is still very good.Foreigners often choose this hotel."
1,酒店还可以，临江，购物比较方便，不过附近饭馆不多，房间建议选择双床的，比较大，单间很小；电脑实在不是这个时代的，空调声音有点吵；服务还不错。,"The hotel is okay, Linjiang, shopping is more convenient, but there are not many restaurants nearby. The room is recommended to choose a double bed. It is relatively large and the single room is small. The computer is not in this era. The sound of air conditioning is a bit noisy; the service is not bad."
1,地理位置还算可以，酒店房间有点旧，但不影响什么。只是房间的隔音比较差，旁边的进出房间和说话都听得很清楚。有时会影响睡觉。,"The geographical location is okay. The hotel room is a bit old, but it does not affect anything.It's just that the sound insulation in the room is relatively poor, and the rooms next to the room and talking are clearly heard.Sometimes it affects sleep."
1,清明小长假过去的，和晓起的农家标间比较，这个价格和设施还是比较有竞争力的。不远处有锦江之星，如果事先知道，应该会选择锦江。毕竟酒店有些陈旧，感觉只有三星标准，而且早餐尤其惨不忍睹。,"Compared with the farm standard between the Qingming holiday, this price and facilities are relatively competitive.There are Jinjiang Stars not far away. If you know in advance, you should choose Jinjiang.After all, the hotel is old, and it feels only Samsung standard, and breakfast is particularly terrible."
1,此宾馆十分气派，唯一美中不足的是，我去的那几天，从宾馆出来不容易打到车,"This hotel is very angry, the only thing that is in the same beauty is that in the few days I went, it was not easy to get from the hotel to the car to get the car"
1,这是一家市政府指定招待所，分好几个区域，住的是贵宾楼，应该是宾馆中最好的区域吧。实在话，宾馆的服务员素质不错，会微笑服务，见了面会打招呼。早餐质量很一般，有点失望。但在东营，我想在东城办事的人来说，这是首选，西城的海天虽好，但离东城有二十几公里地。,"This is a designated guest house for a municipal government. It is divided into several areas. It is the VIP building. It should be the best area in the hotel.In fact, the hotel's waiter is good, and he will smile at the service.The quality of breakfast is very average and a little disappointed.But in Dongying, I want to work in Dongcheng, this is the first choice. Although the sea of Xicheng is good, there are more than 20 kilometers from Dongcheng."
1,"我住的湖景房,房间不大但卫生间蛮大的还有阳台很不错,看风景很美,服务很热情.见面就笑脸相迎.这酒店是夏天度假的好地方.就是房价贵了点要1100多一夜哦!!下次还会去住!!","The lake view room I live in, the room is not large, but the bathroom is quite large, and the balcony is very good. It is very beautiful to see the scenery and the service is very enthusiastic. This hotel is a good place for summer vacation.It takes more than 1100 a night !! I will live next time !!"
1,在携程上定了豪华大床房，要求A区6楼的房间，可惜到了的时候，由于都满，只有3层的，虽然视野不够开阔，还好也能看到湖，景色很美。服务也很好，服务员都会主动问好。打电话要风油精也很快送到。中餐厅太小，而且很吵，还要自己跑去点菜，鱼头汤味道不错，其他很一般。花园风景非常漂亮，游泳池很晚都有人在游泳，可惜这次时间不够，只在室内的游了游。网上介绍有烧烤，结果打电话询问说根本没有。晕。总的来说还是非常满意的，男朋友跟我一起回国三次，出去旅游了三次，这次是最满意的。特别是看到孔雀，兴奋不已。拍了很多照片，说下次还想来。,"A luxurious large bed room was set on Ctrip, requiring the room on the 6th floor of Area A. Unfortunately, because it was full, there were only 3 floors. Although the field of vision was not open enough, the lake could also be seen, and the scenery was beautiful.The service is also very good, and the waiter will take the initiative to ask well.Calling the wind and oil essence will be delivered quickly.The Chinese restaurant is too small and noisy. I also have to run to order for myself. The fish head soup tastes good, and the others are very general.The scenery of the garden is very beautiful. There are people swimming in the swimming pool very late. Unfortunately, this time is not enough, and I only swim indoors.There are barbecue on the Internet, but the result of calling and asking for no.faint.In general, I am very satisfied. My boyfriend returned to China three times with me and went out to travel three times. This time is the most satisfactory.Especially when I saw a peacock, I was excited.I took a lot of photos and said I want to come next time."
1,酒店很不错，好的方面：1.酒店位置好，特别是从湖景房看出去风景非常美。海景通常都比较单调，而且海水潮涨潮落的声音有时感觉有点吵，而湖景就很安静，湖中有点点岛屿，景色非常不错。2.服务主动、热情、积极，很难得。3.房间宽敞，坐在浴缸里洗澡时可以看到景色，感觉很棒。4.除房费不便宜外，其他费用都不贵，相对5星级来讲，简直可以说是很便宜。说点不足：1.个人感觉房间装潢风格稍显点土气，不过多呆些时候也就习惯了2.餐饮水准很不够。中餐是杭帮菜为主，菜式和口味跟马路上的小饭店相比没多大进步。西餐也是本土化的西餐，无论从菜单、口味都有待改善。而且一般度假酒店里应该多些小食、简餐、特饮等等，这方面很缺乏。虽然有些不足还有待提高。下次休假，还会考虑选择住这家酒店。,"The hotel is very good, good aspects: 1. The hotel location is good, especially from the lake view room to the scenery.The sea view is usually relatively monotonous, and the sound of the tide of seawater is sometimes a bit noisy, and the lake scene is very quiet. There is a little island in the lake, and the scenery is very good.2. The service is active, enthusiastic, and active.3. The room is spacious. You can see the scenery when you sit in the bathtub and take a bath. It feels great.4. Except that the cost of housing is not cheap, other costs are not expensive. Compared with 5 stars, it can be said to be very cheap.Speaking of insufficient: 1. Personally, I feel that the room decoration style is slightly rustic, but it is used to staying more time. 2. The level of catering is not enough.Chinese food is dominated by Hangbang cuisine. The dishes and taste have not improved much compared with the small restaurants on the road.Western food is also a local western food. Both the menu and taste need to be improved.And general resort hotels should have more snacks, meals, special drinks, etc., which are very lacking in this regard.Although some shortcomings need to be improved.Next vacation, you will also consider choosing to stay in this hotel."
1,１酒店的服务非常好，就连酒店做卫生的阿姨都会很有礼貌的对小朋友打招呼，是我在其他酒店没有感受到的，非常适合居家度假入住。２中餐厅很有特色，乾隆一品鱼头很有特色，半个鱼头３．６斤，再加两个小菜，一家三口可以吃的很饱。３室外游泳池一定要去，免费的不享受可惜了，白天晚上的感受不一样。相比之下千岛湖旅游项目倒是逊色了很多，不如在酒店好好享受了。,"1 The service of the hotel is very good. Even the aunt who is hygienic in the hotel will greet the children politely. I have not felt it in other hotels. It is very suitable for home vacations.2 Chinese restaurants are very distinctive. Qianlong's one -grade fish head is very distinctive. It is 3.6 pounds in half a fish head. With two small dishes, the family of three can be eaten.3 The outdoor swimming pool must go. It is a pity not to enjoy it for free. The feelings during the day and night are different.In contrast, Qiandao Lake tourism project is much inferior, it is better to enjoy it in the hotel."
1,"房间比较小,酒店设施可能时间长了有些陈旧.服务态度尚可,总的来说这个价格还算可以的,如果早餐能够再丰富一些的话就更好了.","The room is relatively small, and the hotel facilities may be old for a long time. The service attitude is acceptable. In general, this price is okay. It would be better if the breakfast can be richer."
1,酒店的环境不错，餐厅价格也合适，非常适合度假。就是希望宽带能免费。,"The hotel's environment is good, and the price of restaurants is also suitable, which is very suitable for vacation.I hope that the broadband can be free."
1,酒店环境还可以，交通也还算方便，只是觉得这样的房价还不含早餐有点不太尽人意，还有这已经是第三次入住，给我的感觉酒店有点皇帝女儿的感觉。游泳、健身餐饮好像都是单独承包的，尤其是游泳和健身还要单独买票，真是滑稽，房价和服务水准不匹配。补充点评2007年8月23日：宽带收费也算高的，,"The hotel environment is also okay, and the transportation is pretty convenient. I just feel that such house prices are not unsatisfactory without breakfast. And this is the third time to stay, and it feels like the hotel feels a little emperor and daughter.Swimming and fitness catering seems to be contracted separately, especially when swimming and fitness also buy tickets separately. It is really funny. House prices and service levels do not match.Supplementary comment on August 23, 2007: Broadband charges are also high,"
1,在宁夏来说这人酒店应该是算好的一个酒店了吧.,"In Ningxia, this hotel should be a good hotel."
1,"酒店不错,已多次住过,同等价格下次还会入住.","The hotel is good, I have lived many times, and I will stay in the same price next time."
1,"有四星的标准,不过交通略嫌不方便,本来可以做的更好的.","There are four -star standards, but the traffic is slightly inconvenient. It can have been done better."
1,这是我每年都去重庆必住的地方，超级喜欢它的四厅的咖啡厅，室外部份与公园相接，很舒服！而且工作人员的态度很好，服务很不错，感觉比希尔顿好很多！而且它的装修维护的很好，让我三年多来一直倍感亲切,"This is where I go to Chongqing every year. I really like its four -hall cafes. The outdoor part is connected to the park. It is very comfortable!And the staff's attitude is very good, the service is very good, it feels much better than Hilton!And its decoration is well maintained, which has made me feel kind for more than three years"
1,入住的第一天晚上正巧停电停水，比较难过，但服务还算不错，房间隔音效果不太好，住在17层上居然也能隔着窗户清晰的听到街上的车马声。,"On the first night of staying, it happened to be out of power and stopping the water. It was more sad, but the service was pretty good. The room sound insulation was not very good. You could clearly hear the sound of car and horses on the street through the window on the 17th floor."
1,本次入住的单人大床房，318元一间/晚，七星一直给人感觉还不错，设施干净，宜人，房间较大，对得起四星级吧。不过近半年感觉价格再暗升：（1）价格没有变，但是不再送早餐了（七星的早餐还是对得起四星级的，西式中式俱全，现场制作米粉汤面等）（2）房间提供的茶叶不如以前，好像也没有雀巢咖啡的袋泡装了（3）最近还在装修，白天房间能听见声音，不过影响不大。宾馆反馈2008年5月13日：尊敬的宾客，感谢您入住七星商务酒店并真诚地提出了相关建议。为了能更好地服务宾客，我们酒店部分楼层及餐饮、娱乐设施正在进行改造，酒店也竭力将把给客人带来的不便降至最低。例如：控制施工时间，尽量保证商务客人的休息；增加多款中式菜式的房间送餐等等。有关您提及的早餐事宜，根据酒店与携程的合作协议，所有房价均为净价，不含早餐。有关您反映的袋泡茶质量问题，我们已向相关部门反馈，并将做相应调整。另客房内袋装雀巢咖啡原仅在所有商务楼层客房、豪华客房内配备，现将于所有客房配备，咖啡及杯具的配给正处于采购中。再一次感谢您给本酒店提出的宝贵意见，我们真诚地期盼您再次光临，期望您能体会到所有细节的改变，七星商务酒店将一如既往重视每一位宾客的意见和建议！,"The single -person bedroom for this time, 318 yuan per night, the seven stars have always felt good, the facilities are clean, pleasant, and the room is large.However, in the past six months, it feels that the price has risen again: (1) The price has not changed, but the breakfast will not be delivered (the seven -star breakfast is still worthy of four -star, Western Chinese style, making rice noodles on the spot, etc. (2) The tea provided by the room is not as good as the room provided by the room.In the past, there seemed to be no bubbles of Nestle coffee. (3) Recently, I was still decorated. The room could hear the sound during the day, but the impact was not great.Hotel feedback on May 13, 2008: Dear guests, thank you for staying at the Qixing Business Hotel and made relevant suggestions sincerely.In order to better serve the guests, some floors of our hotel and catering and entertainment facilities are being transformed, and the hotel will try to minimize the inconvenience to the guests.For example: control construction time, try to ensure the rest of business guests; add meals in rooms with a variety of Chinese dishes, and so on.Regarding the breakfast you mentioned, according to the cooperation agreement between the hotel and Ctrip, all housing prices are net prices and do not include breakfast.We have given feedback to relevant departments and will be adjusted accordingly.In addition, the rooms in the guest room are originally equipped with all commercial floors and luxury rooms. It will be equipped with all rooms. The distribution of coffee and cups is in procurement.Thank you again for your precious opinions on the hotel. We sincerely look forward to your visit again. I hope you can realize the changes in all details. The Qixing Business Hotel will continue to pay attention to the opinions and suggestions of each guest!"
1,"硬件基本什么都不缺,但又总觉得缺点什么!","The hardware is basically not lacking, but I always feel that there are shortcomings!"
1,"房间还不错,就是电视有点高,看着有点累,前台服务还可以.","The room is not bad, that is, the TV is a bit high, it looks a bit tired, the front desk service is okay."
1,"我这个周末(11月10-11日)入住了这家酒店,住的豪华间,整体感觉不错,可就是浴室只有淋浴,而且空间太小,另外房间隔音功能太差,走廊的吵声,房间听的清清楚楚,影响情绪.在结帐的时候碰到同样在携程订的这家酒店的漂亮MM(感觉超好),她住两天,房型和我一样,可价格似乎不同,由于当时赶飞机回北京,没有仔细了解(只是在前台结帐时随便聊了:你也是携","I stayed in this hotel this weekend (November 10-11). The luxurious room I lived in. The overall feels good, but the bathroom is only a shower, and the space is too small.Listen clearly and affect emotions. When I checkout, I encountered the beautiful MM (I feel super good). She lived for two days. The room type was the same as me.Return to the plane back to Beijing and do not understand it carefully (just talked casually when checking out at the front desk: you are also carrying"
1,各项服务非常周到，前台人员热情，楼层服务人员周到细致，房间送餐服务快捷味美！,"Various services are very thoughtful, the front desk staff is enthusiastic, the service staff of the floor is thoughtful, and the room delivery service is fast and delicious!"
1,"房间不大,但里面的硬件设备不错,地理位置也很好,只是下面的KTV实在比较吵","The room is not large, but the hardware equipment inside is good and the geographical location is good, but the KTV below is really noisy"
1,1、早餐品种比较丰富，时间跨度也可以2、房间的整体装修不错，也比较宽敞，感觉很舒服对于此酒店整体比较满意,"1. Breakfast varieties are relatively abundant, and the time span can also be 2. The overall decoration of the room is good, and it is relatively spacious. It feels very comfortable to be satisfied with this hotel as a whole"
1,在酒店住了一夜，是因为这里是淄博排名前几位的酒店吧，总结起来有几点意见：1、总共在饭店门口下车四次，其中两次看不见门童，两次门童不理我。2、前台人员一般，着装较差，有个服务员的胸牌上“淄博饭店”中淄博二字被划掉了。3、客房装修一般，像是翻修过。门都有刷漆痕迹和掉漆现象。衣橱的一个门掉了。4、洗手间浴室。毛巾还行。马桶上没有一般酒店都有的“已经消毒请放心使用”的标签。浴池的下水口塞子坏掉了。5、电视机是老式球面电视，收的台倒是不少。6、因为去的时候淄博在进行文明城市评选工作。所有的娱乐场所都关门了。酒店的也都关了。没有发生什么小姐叫门电话骚扰的事情发生。7、酒店送的洗浴中心的券没法用。8、早餐还行。我去的时候七点多一点，有的菜品还在上。9、所处街道环境很幽静。,"I stayed at the hotel overnight because this is the top of the hotel in Zibo. There are a few opinions in summary: 1. Get off at the hotel door four times.Give me me.2. The front desk personnel are generally poor. The word ""Zibo Hotel"" on the ""Zibo Hotel"" is drawn off on the ""Zibo Hotel"".3. The room decoration is generally renovated.The doors have paint traces and paint.A door of the wardrobe dropped.4. Bathroom bathroom.The towel is okay.There are no ""sterilized use"" labels on the toilet.The stuff of the lower water mouth of the bath was broken.5. The TV is an old spherical TV, and there are a lot of collections.6. Because when I went, Zibo was conducting a civilized city selection.All the entertainment venues are closed.The hotel is also closed.Nothing ladies happened to call the door call harassment.7. The vouchers at the bathing center sent by the hotel are unavailable.8. Breakfast is okay.When I went at 7 o'clock, some dishes were still up.9. The street environment is quiet."
1,服务还好，早餐不错，酒店位置不错，值得推荐,"The service is okay, the breakfast is good, the hotel location is good, it is worth recommending"
1,住的酒店还算舒服环境不错。早餐也还可以。唯一遗憾的我的笔记本充电器拉在了酒店，发现后打电话给酒店说没有发现有遗漏！我的出差形成很简单：酒店---客户---下一家酒店，电脑都是放在皮箱里的。,"The hotel where the staying is quite comfortable and the environment is good.Breakfast is ok.The only regrettable for my laptop charger was pulled at the hotel, and after finding it, I called the hotel and said that no omissions were found!My business trip is very simple: hotel-customer --- The next hotel, the computer is placed in the suitcase."
1,这是我出门住过的性价比最高的酒店了～～～服务很好，房间也没漂亮，开开窗就是滨河路的景色～美中不足的就是酒店大概有KTV包房，晚上12点前在房间里都能听到好大声音的音乐……其他的服务简直好极了～以后希望还能入住。呵呵就是莱西地方太小了,"This is the most cost -effective hotel I have lived in ~~~ The service is very good, and the room is not beautiful. Opening the window is the scenery of Binhe Road ~ The inadequate in the beauty is that the hotel has about KTV private rooms.You can hear the sound of good sound ... Other services are simply very good ~ I hope to stay in the future.Hehe is the Laixi place is too small"
1,里面的设施还不错，地段也可以。会考虑下次入住。不过在人性化设置上要予以改善。宾馆反馈2008年7月10日：感谢您入住世纪大饭店和给我们提出的宝贵改进意见。在今后的服务中我们会不断改进，同时针对每位客人给我们提出的人性化建议进行改进，不断提高。河北世纪大饭店本着一切为客人着想的原则，为您提供更加细致入微的服务！,"The facilities inside are not bad, and the location is also available.Will consider the next check -in.However, it must be improved in humanized settings.Hotel feedback on July 10, 2008: Thank you for staying at the Century Hotel and the valuable improvement opinions made for us.In future services, we will continue to improve, and at the same time, we will improve the humanized suggestions made by each guest and continuously improve.Based on the principles of all the thoughts of the Hebei Century, the Hebei Century Hotel provides you with more detailed services!"
1,2007年十一期间入住该酒店的商务大床房，但是床实在不够大，可能也就1.5米。如果是两人旅游不建议入住该酒店的商务大床房。房间还算干净，但由于酒店旁边刚好是一个游乐园，十一关门的很晚，吵得休息不好，几次投诉前台的接线生态度一直不错，但解决问题的能力不够强，第二天退房时前台经理态度十分好，不停的解释道歉，使我对酒店的印象大大的变好了，相信这家酒店的管理还是大有前途的。,"During the 11th period of 2007, he stayed at the hotel's large business bed room, but the bed was not large enough, and it may be 1.5 meters.If the two are traveling, it is not recommended to stay in the hotel's large business bed room.The room is quite clean, but because the hotel is just a amusement park next to the hotel, it is very late for eleven closes, and the noisy rest is not good.When checking out, the front desk manager was very good. He kept explaining an apology, which greatly improved my impression of the hotel. I believe that the management of this hotel is still promising."
1,入住的房间不可以开窗，空气流通欠满意，比较遗憾宾馆反馈2008年7月10日：首先因饭店房间安排造成您的不满表示歉意。同时我们会与携程及时沟通将您的要求录入到“饭店客史信息中”，在您下次入住时前台就可以根据客史信息直接给您安排可以开窗的房间了。河北世纪大饭店期待您的再次光临！,"The rooms where you stay can not be opened. The air circulation is not satisfactory. Unfortunately, the hotel feedback on July 10, 2008: First, you apologize for your dissatisfaction due to the hotel room arrangement.At the same time, we will communicate with Ctrip in a timely manner to enter your requirements into ""Hotel History Information"". When you stay in the next time, you can directly arrange the room where you can open the window according to the customer history information.Hebei Century Hotel is looking forward to your visit again!"
1,比较清静，环境还好，我住的一楼房间比较潮湿有霉味，蚊子较多,"It's relatively quiet, the environment is okay, the room on the first floor I live is more humid and moldy, and there are more mosquitoes."
1,南昌国贸饭店，地段满热闹。到八一广场大约8元。房间小小的，厕所的墙壁换成了磨砂玻璃，倒也显得比较通透。房间实在是有点小。但还算干净。,"Nanchang International Trade Hotel, the location is full of lively.About 8 yuan to Bayi Plaza.The room is small, and the wall of the toilet is replaced with matte glass, which looks more transparent.The room is a bit small.But it's not clean."
1,因为只住了一晚，所以没什么感觉，差不多四星吧。大堂的地砖很漂亮。房间小了一点。,"Because I only lived for one night, I didn't feel it, almost four stars.The floor tiles in the lobby are very beautiful.The room is a little smaller."
1,地理位置客房状况都不错。前台服务需要加强，缺乏灵活性，不能从客人的角度来思考问题。没有接触其他的服务，可能整体的软环境都存在较大的提升空间。,"The location of the rooms is good.The front desk service needs to be strengthened, lack of flexibility, and cannot think about problems from the perspective of guests.Without contact with other services, there may be a lot of room for improvement in the overall soft environment."
1,位置有点偏，不过在京城4星酒店中，此店的价格也算合理。入住的几天，泳池不能使用，失望呀！没有港台及欧美的电视频道，又失望！不过没有夜间电话骚扰，也算难得！附近有欧尚卖场，购物算便利！,"The location is a bit biased, but the price of this shop is reasonable in the 4 -star hotel in Beijing.In the days of staying, the swimming pool cannot be used, disappointed!There are no TV channels in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Europe and the United States, and disappointed again!But there is no night phone harassment, it is rare!There are Auchan Stores nearby, which is convenient for shopping!"
1,老五星级酒店，358元标房，价格实惠，就是房间电视太小，其他不错。,"Old five -star hotel, 358 yuan standard room, affordable price, that is, the room TV is too small, and the others are good."
1,感觉马马虎虎。1、前台服务不错，听说我们要7:00出发赶7:50的飞机，主动提出6:30给我们准备好早餐（正常时间是7:0开始）。2、门童服务不好，俩人就知道躲在门内取暖、聊天，不主动询问客人的需要，酒店打车不方便，门童叫车半天也不来。3、价格还可以在实惠一些，特别是象现在这样的淡季，不应该这么高。,"It feels sloppy.1. The front desk service is good. I heard that we want to start at 7:00 at 7:00 and take the initiative to propose 6:30 to prepare breakfast for us (the normal time starts at 7: 0).2. The door children's service is not good. The two know that they are hiding in the door to warm up and chat. They do not take the initiative to ask the guests' needs. The hotel is inconvenient to take a taxi.3. The price can also be affordable, especially the off -season as now, and it should not be so high."
1,酒店设施比较新，环境也不错，能看到很漂亮的海景。餐厅服务一般，我们下午1点半到酒店，餐厅就没有什么可吃得了，想点的菜，基本都没有。补充点评2007年8月9日：ATM机还是坏的，仍然不能取款，不方便！,"The hotel facilities are relatively new and the environment is good. You can see very beautiful sea views.The restaurant service is average. When we arrive at the hotel at 1:30 pm, there is nothing to eat in the restaurant.Supplementary comment on August 9, 2007: The ATM machine is still bad, and it still cannot withdraw money, which is inconvenient!"
1,1、打车到宾馆和离开，送上登记出租车牌号的卡片，如有物品遗漏，便于查找；2、前台服务很快；3、在3楼中餐厅吃了两顿晚餐，口味蛮好，服务一流，主动引导入座便于观看电视的座位，方便收看奥运，早餐设有厦门小吃区有特色，无论晚餐还是早餐，用餐后服务员都送至电梯；4、因飞机较晚，抱着试试看的想法，反映了一下，免费延长退房2小时，很感动；5、花了不长时间做了问卷调查，送了礼品，惊喜；6、挂了“请勿打扰”，服务员悄悄递了卡片，提醒要清理房间可随时进行，很好；7、地理位置方便，去轮渡、南普陀、厦大等，2元钱空调公交搞定，比的士清凉、宽敞；还有很多，不一一说了，第一次到厦门是10年前没住厦门宾馆，这次住了，以后到厦门就住这里了！,"1. Taxi to the hotel and leave, and send the card with the registered taxi sign.

1,朋友来上海玩，因为都是刚开始工作，就选了离我家比较近又经济实惠的如家房间很大很宽敞，2*2米的大床两个人睡都绰绰有余，超级喜欢的！房间的装潢布置简洁干净，橙色的墙面和窗帘还有壁画感觉很温馨。另外服务态度也不错，在电梯里碰到打扫卫生的阿姨还笑着跟我们打招呼^^就是房间的纱窗很脏，应该定期冲洗一下。马桶圈上有陈年污渍，感觉有点恶心，毛巾边角偶尔也有点点的小污渍，希望都可以检查更换。最后大门进来的一路上有些坑坑洼洼，下雨天就积水了，如果从整体环境考虑的话建议把路面修修平，还有门口那个不知道是保安还是出租车司机，有点莫名其妙……总体来说还是很满意的，有机会一定还会再住宾馆反馈2008年6月12日：尊敬的宾客：您好！感谢您对酒店的支持和肯定。至于您提到的房间硬件设施上的问题，酒店已列入下半年整改计划中，并在逐项实施中，毛巾已全部更换新的，纱窗已在清洗中，马桶圈也已列入年度整改计划，门口的地砖因前几天下雨而耽搁，现已全部修补完毕。关于门口的安保，酒店已在第一时间联系了物业的经理，在工作时间，注意细节操作，制止负面的形象再次的产生，加以督导。酒店将以完善的设施和更好的服务期待您的再次光临。,"Friends came to Shanghai to play, because they were at the beginning of work, they chose the more economical and affordable rooms from my home. The rooms of the family were very spacious. The 2*2 -meter -big bed was more than enough to sleep.The decoration of the room is simple and clean, and the orange walls, curtains and murals feel very warm.In addition, the service attitude is also good. In the elevator, the aunt who was cleaning was also greeted us with a smile ^^ The screen of the room was dirty and should be washed regularly.There are old stains on the toilet ring, and it feels a little nauseous. Occasionally there are small stains on the corner of the towel. I hope it can be checked and replaced.In the end, there were some potholes along the door, and water was accumulated on rainy days. If you consider the overall environment, it is recommended to repair the road surface, and the door at the door doesn’t know if it is a security guard or a taxi driver.Satisfied, if you have the opportunity, you will stay in the hotel and feedback on June 12, 2008: Dear guest: Hello!Thank you for your support and affirmation of the hotel.As for the problems in the hardware facilities you mentioned, the hotel has been included in the rectification plan in the second half of the year, and in the implementation of items, the towels have been replaced, and the screens have been cleaned.The plan, the floor tile at the door was delayed due to the rain a few days ago, and it has been repaired.Regarding the security at the door, the hotel has contacted the property manager for the first time. At work hours, pay attention to detail operations, and stop the negative image of the image again and supervise it.The hotel will look forward to your visit with complete facilities and better services."
1,"在上海光大这个地区,如家的价格还是非常好的!它的对门以前是一个老的国营旅馆(名称叫酒店,其实也就是旅馆)服务实在恶心:你想长住,不仅不优惠,在房间紧张的时候还哄你走人.宾馆反馈2008年4月30日：尊敬的宾客：您好！感谢您对如家光大店的支持与认可，如家的理念就是“温馨如家，洁净似月”，我们会继续努力，为您提供更优质服务。期待您的下次光临并多提宝贵意见谢谢！","In this area of Shanghai Everbright, the price of Rujia is still very good! It has a old state -owned hotel (name is hotel, which is actually a hotel) service.When you are, you also coax you away. Hotel feedback on April 30, 2008: Dear guest: Hello!Thank you for your support and recognition of Rujiaguangdian. The concept of the family is ""warm as home, clean and like month"". We will continue to work hard to provide you with better services.Looking forward to your next visit and mentioning more valuable opinions. Thank you!"
1,"酒店的位置还不错，尤其对于到光大会展的人步行几分钟就到了，价格也算是合理。但是携程的优惠幅度太低了。房间装修味道太浓,走廊里没有地毯有点吵,其余还可以.宾馆反馈2008年4月30日：尊敬的宾客：您好！感谢您对酒店的认可与评价。关于您提到的房间装修味道太浓，因酒店现正处于地毯更改地板的工程，给您带来的不便，酒店深表歉意！酒店全体员工会一如既往为所有宾客提供优质的服务。酒店期待您的再次光临，谢谢！","The location of the hotel is not bad, especially for the people who arrive at the light conference for a few minutes, the price is reasonable.But Ctrip's discount is too low.The decoration of the room is too strong, and there is no carpet in the corridor. The rest can also be. The hotel feeds on April 30, 2008: Dear guest: Hello!Thank you for your recognition and evaluation of the hotel.The decoration of the room you mentioned is too strong, because the hotel is now in the carpet to change the floor project, the inconvenience brought by you, the hotel is deeply apologized!All the hotel employees will always provide high -quality services to all guests.The hotel is looking forward to your visit again, thank you!"
1,交通方便，环境还行，就是酒店整体服务水平欠佳宾馆反馈2008年4月24日：您好！感谢您对酒店提出的忠恳的建议，酒店会加强内部的管理及各岗位的培训。为您提供优质的服务，一直是我们的宗旨，我们会秉呈这个宗旨，让您满意。期待您的下次光临及更多的建议。谢谢！,"The transportation is convenient and the environment is OK, that is, the hotel's overall service level is not good.Thank you for your loyal suggestions for the hotel, the hotel will strengthen internal management and training in various positions.Providing you with high -quality services has always been our purpose. We will be satisfied with this purpose.Looking forward to your next visit and more suggestions.Thanks!"
1,这个酒店的淋浴设备不行，更别说没有澡盆了。洗完澡整个厕所都是湿漉漉的。其他方面没有感觉到，不评价了。,"The shower equipment of this hotel is not good, let alone the bathtub.After taking a shower, the entire toilet is wet.I didn't feel it in other aspects, and I didn't evaluate it."
1,"硬件环境我觉得只有3星,可能是因为我订的是普通标准间.并且前台服务的意识我觉得也没有4星.希望这个宾馆能够提高.","I think there are only 3 stars in the hardware environment, maybe because I booked a normal standard room. And I don't think I don't have 4 stars in the front desk service. I hope this hotel can improve."
1,这两年保定的星级宾馆我住了一圈，还是恒通财富中心最适中的。378这价钱值这个环境和房子。,"In the past two years, I have lived in the Star Hotel in Baoding, and it is still the most suitable for Hengtong Wealth Center.378 This is worth the environment and house."
1,已在这家宾馆下榻n次了，房间很舒适，卫生间的玻璃隔断很别致，喜欢这里。,"It's been N times in this hotel, the room is very comfortable, and the glass partitions in the bathroom are very chic and like here."
1,房间收拾的很干净，空间很大，浴室的设计很别致，只是浴室内少了个防滑脚踏垫，要小心以免摔跤；电梯间与客房间的走廊很像在走迷宫；早餐的位置设计不佳，进出很不方便也好像在走迷宫；整体的印像还是很好的，下次有机会到保定还会入住。,"The room is clean, the space is very large, and the design of the bathroom is very chic, but there is a non -slip pedal pad in the bathroom, so be careful to avoid wrestling.Jia, it is inconvenient to enter and exit, it seems to be walking the maze; the overall impression is still very good, and next time I have the opportunity to go to Baoding, I will stay."
1,刚刚到前台Checkin的那一刻，服务员爱理不理头都不抬，一点微笑都没有；入住之后服务人员态度大好，房间清洁员都很友善。一直没太想通。整体很喜欢，但房间内部设备的选用和安装显得粗糙-希望能够长久有好的软硬件服务。宾馆反馈2008年6月26日：感谢您入住华君酒店。由于酒店正处于发展期，部分新招募的员工服务意识尚有欠缺，我们酒店会不断地加强培训和指导，力争每位客人入住华君都能有宾至如归的感觉。亦希望能够得到您的鼓励和长久的支持。请您在方便之余与酒店市场部联系，我们将提供令您满意的服务。,"At the moment when I arrived at the front desk, the waiter ignored the lift, and did not have a smile at all; after check -in, the service staff attitude was good, and the cleaners in the room were very friendly.I have never thought too much.I like it as a whole, but the selection and installation of the internal equipment of the room looks rough-I hope to have good software and hardware services for a long time.Hotel feedback on June 26, 2008: Thank you for staying at Huajun Hotel.As the hotel is in the development period, some newly recruited employee service awareness is still lacking. Our hotel will continue to strengthen training and guidance, and strive to feel that every guest can move in Huajun.I also hope to get your encouragement and long -term support.Please contact the hotel marketing department for convenience, we will provide services that make you satisfactory."
1,前后在华君住了将近10天，基本满意。酒店服务人员彬彬有礼，有服务意识。酒店马路对面有两家小超市，但价格离谱。酒店南、北、东、西步行五分钟内没有大型商业设施，比较安静。门口有818、796、981、314、607、82公交车可换乘地铁2号线，到浦东南路东昌路下。印象最深刻的是，4月8日早上上海下雨，我一手举着伞，一手提着笔记本电脑，站在路边等出租车，这时候一个在门口的工作人员看到，他走出来，站在雨里帮我打车，向他道谢的时候，他一脸笑容地说：你住我们酒店，我很乐意帮助你。”就因为这个细节，以后在选择酒店的时候，我会再次选华君。当然，华君也有它的瑕疵，因为服务是没有止境的，任何一个酒店都会有。但华君出的笑话有点初级了：前台要求客人在预授权交易时签字。（顺便提醒一下：信用卡预授权是制发卡机构或其代理机构在特约商户扣款前，确认许可冻结额度的交易。如果你不结帐就离店，酒店可以申请预授权金额的130%以内的扣款。为了安全，一定不要在确认处签字。万不得已，可以在背面签字，并注明使用用途或者明确金额、日期。）向他们当天值班的某位管理层反映，他居然说“没听说过！”看来华君在现代化管理上还有不短的一段路要走。宾馆反馈2008年4月18日：十分感谢您入住华君酒店，关于您对酒店提出的意见，我们将会向酒店管理层反映并做出改善，真诚期望您能够再次入住我们酒店。谢谢！,"He lived in Huajun for nearly 10 days before and after, and was basically satisfied.The hotel service staff is polite and has a sense of service.There are two small supermarket across the hotel road, but the price is outrageous.There are no large -scale commercial facilities in the north, north, east, and west of the hotel, which is relatively quiet.At the door, there are 818, 796, 981, 314, 607, 82 bus transfer to Metro Line 2 to Dongchang Road, Pudong South Road.What impressed me most was that in Shanghai on the morning of April 8th, I held an umbrella in one hand, holding a laptop with one hand, standing on the roadside and waiting for taxis. At this time, a staff member at the door saw that he came out.When he stood in the rain to help me take a taxi, when he thanked him, he said with a smile: You live in our hotel, I am happy to help you.""Just because of this detail, when I chose a hotel in the future, I will choose Huajun again. Of course, Huajun also has its flaws, because the service is not stopped, and any hotel will have it. But the jokes from Huajun are a bit primary.: The front desk requires guests to sign when pre -authorized transactions. (By the way, the credit card pre -authorization is a card -making institution or its agency confirming the transaction of the free -term free limit before the special merchant deducts., Hotels can apply for deductions within 130%of the pre -authorized amount. For security, do not sign at the confirmation place. You must sign it on the back, and indicate the use of use or clear amount and date.) To them on the duty on the day of the duty on the dayThe management of the position reflected that he actually said, ""I haven't heard of it!""It seems that Hua Jun still has a short way to go in modernization management. Hotel feedback on April 18, 2008: Thank you very much for staying at Huajun Hotel. Regarding your opinions on the hotel, we will manage the hotel managementThe layer reflects and improves, and sincerely hopes that you can stay in our hotel again. Thank you!"
1,"又入住了，酒店总体服务还可以，前台客房的人还是很热情,只是这次的房间有点吵，大概是靠近马路吧，反正只是一个晚上就算了。入住的人明显比过年时候多了，房价也涨了，哎！","Staying again, the overall service of the hotel is okay. The people in the front desk are still very enthusiastic, but this time the room is a bit noisy, probably near the road, anyway, just one night.The people who stayed in were obviously more than the New Year, and the house prices rose, hey!"
1,住了2天一直下雨，看了以前其他人的点评感觉行李员的态度现在要好很多。因为房间紧张我还被免费升级了房间，不错。美中不足的是早餐种类太少。,"I have been raining for 2 days, and I have seen the comments of others before I feel that the attitude of the luggage staff is much better now.Because the room was tense, I was also upgraded to the room for free.The disadvantage is that there are too few breakfast."
1,房间环境不错，餐厅环境和口味都很一般，其他设施，游泳池没有，服务只能给到3星。价格不便宜。1个优势，下马陆高速就是，而在嘉定很出名，好像是因为F1，因为价格贵，所以比较好找。在哪打车，都知道这个酒店。,"The room environment is good, the restaurant environment and taste are very average. Other facilities, no swimming pools, and service can only be given 3 stars.The price is not cheap.One advantage is that the Malaysian High Speed is famous, and it is very famous in Jiading. It seems that it is because of F1, because the price is expensive, so it is better to find it.Where to take a taxi, I know this hotel."
1,地理位置不错，附近就是春熙路商业街，对面就是王府井百货。出门打车有点困难，附近吃饭的地方比较少，没有什么成都特色的餐饮。酒店的服务挺不错，但是银座边上有一个塔一样的东西，半夜会有轰鸣声，比较吵。,"The geographical location is good. Nearby is Chunxi Road Commercial Street, and opposite is Wangfujing Department Store.It is a bit difficult to take a taxi. There are relatively few places to eat nearby. There is no food in Chengdu.The hotel's service is pretty good, but there is a tower -like thing on the side of Ginza. There will be roar in the middle of the night, which is more noisy."
1,房间大，卫生间比较简陋，走廊有股味道。位于市中心附近，购物吃饭都很方便。银川是个很干净很悠闲的城市，很值得一去。,"The room is large, the bathroom is relatively rude, and the corridor has the taste.Located near the city center, shopping and eating are very convenient.Yinchuan is a very clean and leisurely city, and it is worth visiting."
1,"住了3天的五号楼,感觉相当不错.无论客房还是餐饮部的员工都能给客人以真诚微笑的服务.酒店附近交通方便,离市中心和各景区都不远.下次还会来住.","Building 5, which has been living for 3 days, feels quite good. Whether the guest rooms and the restaurant employees can give guests a sincere smile. The transportation near the hotel is convenient, not far from the city center and the scenic spots.live."
1,酒店经营一般，但交通便利，价格公道，早餐不太好,"The hotel is generally operated, but the transportation is convenient, the price is fair, and the breakfast is not good"
1,这个酒店位于市中心位置，交通方便，价格公道，就是单间房型不好，有点吵。,"This hotel is located in the center of the city, with convenient transportation and fair price, that is, the single room type is not good and a bit noisy."
1,总台服务员态度不好，房间比想像的小，但比想像的要整洁爽利有骚扰电话，因为我是女客，所以接了之后没说话就挂断了，门下也有一堆小卡片塞进来建议睡觉的时候要关卫生间的门，不然一大早会被楼上楼下的水声吵醒补充点评2008年1月11日：因为团结湖店位置比较好，所以房源比较紧张，订的话需要提前几天,"The waiter in the main station is not good, and the room is smaller than expected, but it is more neat and neat and harassing than imagined. Because I am a female guest, I hung up without talking. There is a bunch of small cards under the door.It is recommended to close the door of the bathroom when going to bed, otherwise the sound of water from upstairs and downstairs will be awakened early in the morning. Complex comments on January 11, 2008: Because the location of the united lake shop is better, the listing of the house is relatively tight.Need a few days in advance"
1,"房间比较干净整洁,服务也不错,当时定了稍有出入,酒店也及时进行了调整,不错不错","The room is relatively clean and tidy, and the service is also good. At that time, it was a bit different, and the hotel was adjusted in time."
1,我住过几次这里了，这次感觉最好，我要结帐的时候，想买两盒店里的月饼，但是由于是中午，不能马上取走，前台的小姐积极的帮我打电话联系，让我很感动，并且她们还帮我打水单，谢谢她们!另外他们家是可以刷美国运通卡的酒店，在三门峡不好找呀！,"I have lived here a few times. This time I feel the best. When I want to check out, I want to buy two boxes of the moon cakes in the shop, but because it is noon, I ca n’t take it immediately. The lady at the front desk actively calls me to call and contact meIt moved me very much, and they also helped me get a water list, thank them! In addition, their home is a hotel that can swipe the American Express card. It ’s hard to find it in Sanmenxia!"
1,酒店位置不错，就在市中心，从火车站坐2路、9路到体育场下车都可以到，2路还可以到陕州风景区。酒店门口有公交站，6路站牌上写着可以到虢国博物馆，但实际上6路改线了，终点是上村，可以坐到第二个铁路道口下车走一会儿可以到博物馆。定的是单人房，房间不大，但自己一个人住足够了。装修还可以，可地毯和浴室脚垫太脏了！！！！实在太脏了！！！不知道多少年没洗过了！！！其它还好，只是中央空调制冷不太强。一楼餐厅的菜不错，也挺干净，住店客人消费挂帐还可以打8.8折。值得一说的是服务，虽然酒店装修比较旧，但服务是可以达到三星标准的，比较有效率，态度也不错。退房的时候把乘车卡忘在房间里了，房间服务员发现后马上告诉了我。晚上有个穿短裤拖鞋的人想进酒店找人被门童拦住了，被告知短裤拖鞋不能进入，必须衣冠整洁。对这点很满意，这是个城市酒店又不是度假酒店。只是门童的制服太滑稽了。,"The hotel location is good, just in the city center, you can get from the train station to get off at the stadium, and you can also get to the Shaanxi Scenic Area.There is a bus station at the entrance of the hotel. The 6th station sign can be used to the Music Museum, but in fact, the 6th road has changed the line. The end point is Shangcun. You can take the second railway entrance and get off the bus for a while to go to the museum.The single room is determined. The room is not large, but it is enough to live alone.The decoration is okay, but the carpet and bathroom foot pads are too dirty!IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIt's so dirty!IntersectionIntersectionI don’t know how many years have been washed!IntersectionIntersectionIt's okay, but the central air conditioner is not too strong.The restaurant on the first floor is good and clean. The guests in the store can also be 8.8 % off for consumption.It is worth talking about service. Although the hotel decoration is relatively old, the service can meet the Samsung standard. It is more efficient and attitude.When checking out, I forgot the ride card in the room, and the room waiter told me immediately after finding it.At night, someone in a shorts and slippers wanted to enter the hotel to find someone to be stopped by the doorboy. The shorts were told that the shorts and slippers could not enter.I am very satisfied with this, this is a city hotel and not a resort hotel.It's just that the uniform of Men Tong is so funny."
1,11月4号去的住了两个晚上的爱丽舍房间。定了情侣套餐。房间不错，床单很差，沐浴用品都是屈臣氏，很干净，洗手间小，不过楼下有桑拿。起了一点争执，因为情侣套餐中药浴只限男宾，且酒店方说只限一次。怒了，打电话给携程，又跟酒店方沟通，后来在那里呆了三天，每天一次（其实也没时间玩很多次）。酒店内地方很小，但是离红螺寺和慕田峪都很近，上了香，看了红叶。很满足。酒店服务不错，服务员都很纯朴。房间内有暖气，很暖和，阳光很足。就是不太好找，我们在东直门坐916到怀柔汽车站下，打了个车，10元到了，要记住酒店电话，以便边走边问，因为好多司机都不知道地方，且怀柔有很多叫湖光的别墅区。,"I went to the Elishe room for two nights on November 4.The couple set meals.The rooms are good, the sheets are very poor, and the bath products are Watsons. They are very clean and small, but there are sauna downstairs.There was a dispute, because the Chinese medicine bath for couples was limited to male guests, and the hotel said that it was limited to once.I was angry, called Ctrip, and communicated with the hotel again. Later, I stayed there for three days, once a day (in fact, I didn't have time to play many times).The mainland of the hotel is very small, but it is very close to Hongluo Temple and Mutianyu.Satisfied.The hotel service is good, and the waiters are very simple.There is heating in the room, very warm, and the sun is sufficient.It's not very easy to find. We took 916 at Dongzhimen to the Huairou Bus Station and took a car and 10 yuan. Remember the hotel phone and ask, because many drivers don't know the place, and Huairou has a lot of names.Lake Villa area."
1,住的是240的房间，总体感觉还可以，唯一不足的是洗完澡，浴缸下面有漏水，会把靠近浴缸的地方弄湿了。服务态度不错。空调再稍微暖一点就更好了。,"I live in a 240 room. Overall feel is okay. The only disadvantage is to take a bath. There is leakage under the bathtub, which will wet the place near the bathtub.The service attitude is good.The air conditioner is slightly warmer."
1,服务一流，门口公交四通八达，早餐丰富，值得一住。我到厦门五天，两天锦江之星，两天厦门宾馆，都不错，很满意。,"The service is first -class, the bus at the door is in all directions, the breakfast is rich, it is worth living.I went to Xiamen for five days, two days of Jinjiang Star, and two days of Xiamen Hotel."
1,酒店的硬件设施不错，服务也还可以，我订的是海景房，刚开始给了间小角度望海的房间忽悠我，经过和前台投诉很快换了间全海景的房间按，还可以。浴缸值得一赞！,"The hotel's hardware facilities are good, and the service is OK. I booked a sea view room. I just started to give me a small angle at Wanghai's room. After the complaint with the front desk, I quickly changed the full sea view room.The bathtub is worthy of praise!"
1,"房间很大,设施很好,环境优美.服务专业到位.交通如到香港很方便.但到其他地方不太方便.可能我们还不太熟悉.这样档次的宾馆在其他地方,价格绝对可加倍.","The room is very large, the facilities are very good, the environment is beautiful. The service is in place. It is convenient to travel to Hong Kong. But it is not convenient to go to other places. Maybe we are not familiar with it. Such a hotel at a grade can be doubled in other places. The price can be doubled."
1,隔音比较好，就是房间光线暗了点，装修比较陈旧，但是价钱挺便宜，还算物有所值。离市区比较远，附近治安比较差，建议去住的人晚上不要出去，因为外面是城乡结合部,"The sound insulation is better, that is, the light of the room is darker, the decoration is old, but the price is very cheap, and it is worth it.It is far from the urban area and the nearby law and order is poor. It is recommended that people who live in the evening do not go out at night, because there is the urban -rural combination department outside"
1,酒店设施一般，但是前台和客服，行李生都很尽责，而且还给客人免费升级房间,"The hotel facilities are average, but the front desk and customer service are responsible, and it is also responsible for the guests to upgrade the room for free"
1,房间基本条件还是不错的，就是不太习惯坐在地上上网。今天发现居然涨价了，住过的普通单人房从588涨到了958，这个价就有点不值了，sheraton的fourpoints也比这便宜。宾馆反馈2008年8月4日：非常感谢您的宝贵意见，欢迎您再次入住！,"The basic conditions of the room are still good, that is, I am not used to sitting on the ground.Today I found that the price has increased. The ordinary single room where I lived up from 588 to 958. The price was a bit worth it. Sheraton's Fourpoints is also cheaper than this.Hotel feedback on August 4, 2008: Thank you very much for your valuable opinions, welcome to stay again!"
1,11月底刚住过。这家酒店规模太小，楼小只有8层，像个不起眼的小酒店。我的房费是988元，这个钱数可以住其他更气派的酒店了。下次不住这儿了。,"Just lived at the end of November.This hotel is too small, and the building is only 8 floors, like an inconspicuous hotel.My room fee is 988 yuan, and this money can stay in other more elegant hotels.I can't live here next time."
1,闹中取静，年底地铁6号线通了会更方便，在浦东公干，每次都住这里。,"It will be more convenient to take the quietness in the trouble, and it will be more convenient to pass at the end of the year. It will work here in Pudong."
1,在装修，第一天去味道很大，咖啡厅搬到上面后环境不好，可能装修结束后会更好吧。,"On the first day, it tastes a lot. The environment is not good after moving the cafe to the top, and it may be better after the decoration."
1,"不错的酒店,环境很好,服务态度也很好,下次有机会应该还是会入住的","Good hotel, the environment is very good, the service attitude is also very good, there should be a chance to stay next time"
1,是一家非常不的酒店，物有所值，境非常好，前看我是2人一起去的，又送了一份免的早餐，定的候明只有一份的，人感。唯一不足的是生的淋浴房的玻璃好像不能，有水。,"It is a very incomparable hotel. It is worthwhile and the realm is very good. I saw that I went to two people together and gave a free breakfast. There was only one one, and it was human.The only disadvantage is that the glass of the raw shower room does not seem to have water."
1,"环境很好,房间大但旧,服务还好,基本满意,下次可以再住.","The environment is very good, the room is big but old, the service is good, basically satisfied, you can live again next time."
1,"08年5月2号入住,9号楼真的很不错,房间、走廊都很宽大，感觉很舒服。房间外的花园也很漂亮，吃的就一般拉。晋祠正门外次序混乱，实在没敢停车（本想看看晋祠大正门建筑），旅游环境实在太差。","Checking in on May 2, 2008, Building 9 is really good, the rooms and corridors are very large, and it feels very comfortable.The gardens outside the room are also very beautiful, and they usually pull them.The sequence of the main entrance of the Jin Temple was chaotic, and I didn't dare to park (I wanted to see the building of the Jin Temple's main gate), and the tourism environment was too bad."
1,山西最好的宾馆．房间超大．非常干净．下次还去．,The best hotel in Shanxi.The room is too large.Very clean.Go next time.
1,很喜欢这里。原因有两个，一个是周围环境好，跟国家级文保单位――晋祠一墙之隔。另一个是宾馆比较有品位，无论服务，还是装修，很大气。以前都是直接去住，通过携程，确实便宜了不少。我就是山西人，感觉性价比中高，特别值得向外地朋友推荐。有一点遗憾，这里是国宾馆，所以每一栋楼的风格和价位都有差别。建议携程跟他们协商好，可以标的更具体，让外地的朋友享受到更好的服务。,"I like it very much.There are two reasons, one is the surrounding environment, and it is separated from the national cultural security unit -Jin Temple.The other is that the hotel is more tasteful. Whether it is service or decoration, it is very atmospheric.I used to live directly. Through Ctrip, it is really cheaper.I am from Shanxi. I feel cost -effective and high, and I am particularly worth recommending to friends from foreign friends.There is a pity that this is the National Hotel, so the style and price of each building are different.It is recommended that Ctrip negotiated with them that the subjects can be more specific, so that friends from other places can enjoy better services."
1,非常满意。我是10月14日入住该酒店的，我和老婆，岳父丈母娘大人。为了savingmoney，四个人只开了一间标准房，本来担心两个人挤一张床会休息不好，但是，完全出乎意料，床很宽，而且床单很干净，没有酒店里常有的那种霉味，很舒服。洗手间很干净。老人家直夸我选的宾馆好，价钱也公道。值得推荐！缺点：附近有个学校，早上会有做早操的广播轻微干扰，对喜欢睡懒觉的朋友就不太理想了，不过，声音不是很大，10来分钟就结束了。,"Very satisfied.I stayed at the hotel on October 14th, my wife, my father -in -law and mother.In order to SAVINGMONEY, four people only opened a standard room. I was worried that the two people would not rest well when squeezing a bed, but it was completely unexpected, the bed was very wide, and the sheets were very clean.Mold flavor, very comfortable.The toilet is clean.The old man boast that the hotel I choose is good and the price is fair.Recommended!Disadvantages: There is a school nearby, and there will be a slight interference in the morning exercises in the morning. It is not ideal for friends who like to sleep. However, the sound is not very strong, and the 10 minutes are over."
1,房间较新，面积也较大，服务不错，总之还行,"The room is relatively new, the area is also large, and the service is good."
1,"酒店位置不错,在市中心,服务态度很好,设施还可以.只是床太硬.","The hotel location is good. In the city center, the service attitude is very good, the facilities are okay. It's just that the bed is too hard."
1,酒店因为装修时间不长，设施还是不错，但4星酒店居然没有吹风机！头天晚上问过前台说24小时结帐都可以，但早上5点钟走，结帐时竟然只给我100元整单位的发票，说太早了，没有小额的票！,"Because the hotel is not decorated for a long time, the facilities are still good, but the 4 -star hotel has no hair dryer!I asked the front desk the night before that I could check the checkout at the front desk, but I left at 5 o'clock in the morning. I only gave me the invoice of the whole unit of 100 yuan at the checkout. It was too early to say that there was no small ticket!"
1,08年的清明节入住，房价200，不包早餐，包机场接送（就冲着这点订的）。第一天房间送4个苹果，第二天没有，问服务员，大曰第一天才送。后来还是送了2个苹果。房间条件还可以，最好的是网络插口在床头，而且配备的网线超长，可以拉到马桶（适合某些方面耗时较长的同志使用）。卫生间很大，沐浴设施完备，很诱惑本不宜沐浴的宾客使用。不过床垫的弹簧感觉明显，而且宾馆位于市郊（不过拉萨也不大）。,"In the Qingming Festival in 2008, house prices were 200, without breakfast, and airports were delivered (it was settled at this point).On the first day, I gave 4 apples in the room. I did not ask the waiter the next day. I asked the waiter.Later, I gave 2 apples.The room conditions are okay. The best is that the network socket is on the bedside, and the network cable is long and can be pulled to the toilet (suitable for some comrades for some aspects).The bathroom is very large, the bathing facilities are complete, and it is very tempting to use guests who are not suitable for bathing.However, the spring of the mattress feels obvious, and the hotel is located in the suburbs (but Lhasa is not large)."
1,酒店房间好，阳光明媚，卫生间大，可惜没享受。司机说，到拉萨第一天不要洗澡。房间空调足。好像早餐是送到房间的？酒店地点是偏的，但我到拉萨的第一天反正是睡觉，也无所谓了。而且有人接机，挺好。因为睡了一天，酒店的具体也没多看,"The hotel room is good, the sun is bright, and the bathroom is large, but unfortunately not enjoyed.The driver said that the first day of Lhasa should not take a bath.The room is air -conditioned.It seems that breakfast is delivered to the room?The hotel location is partial, but the first day I went to Lhasa was sleeping anyway, it didn't matter.And someone picks up the aircraft, it is good.Because I slept for a day, the hotel did not look at it too much"
1,房间很不错，还有水果送，主要是接机的服务很好，因为机场离市中心很远，还有司机很热情，路上还让我们下来拍照，还介绍旅游的风情，很不错。,"The room is very good, and there are fruits, mainly because the service of picking up the airport is very good, because the airport is far from the city center, and the driver is very enthusiastic. On the road, let's take a picture and introduce the style of tourism. It is very good."
1,今后去大连可以住这家酒店。房间整洁，也比较宽敞，上网速度很快，另外酒店比较安静，晚上休息的比较好。唯一问题是标间的两张床靠太近了，跟同事两人入住时就担心晚上会不会亲密接触，呵呵。,"In the future, you can live in this hotel in Dalian.The room is clean and spacious, the Internet speed is fast. In addition, the hotel is relatively quiet and rests better at night.The only problem is that the two beds in the standard room are too close, and when they stay with my colleagues, they are worried that they will contact intimately at night, haha."
1,酒店环境很好，我订的是标间三个人住，床很大，拼起来可以睡四个人。离市中心也比较近，就是北方好像是空调是全市统一开的，我去住的时候没空调，会比较闷一点。夏天去应该会很好。住得也比较舒服！,"The hotel environment is very good. I booked three people in the standard room, the bed is very large, and I can sleep four people.It is also closer to the city center. It seems that the north seems to be the air conditioner that is uniformly opened in the city. When I go to live, there is no air conditioner, and it will be a bit stuffy.It should be good in summer.Living is more comfortable!"
1,"从北京开车过去还算方便，比较好找。车可以停在大门外也挺放心房间装修一般，三星标准应该是有的。毛巾都很新很干净，这点特别让人舒服。因为是临街，同伴说晚上听见噪音，我倒是一点没听见，睡得挺好。也没有骚扰电话之类的打搅。BTW,马路斜对面有一家东方削面馆，好吃！哈哈！","It is convenient to drive from Beijing and it is easier to find.The car can be parked outside the gate and rest assured that the room decoration is normal, and the Samsung standard should be there.The towels are very new and clean, which is particularly comfortable.Because it was the street, my companion said that when I heard the noise at night, I didn't hear it at all, and I slept well.There is no disturbance of harassing calls.BTW, there is an oriental noodle shop on the opposite side of the road, delicious!Ha ha!"
1,"性价比还可以,装修设备都挺不错~就是有些房间没有窗户~闷~还有就是有乱按门铃的~","The price -performance ratio is OK, the decoration equipment is pretty good ~ There are no windows in some rooms ~ Stuffy ~ There is a messy doorbell ~"
1,早餐内容实在需要改进，唯有咖啡口味还不错。,"Breakfast content really needs to be improved, only the taste of coffee is not bad."
1,房间大小还可以，但设备比较陈旧，天花板低，感觉有点压抑．,"The size of the room is okay, but the equipment is old, the ceiling is low, and it feels a bit depressed."
1,房间很大也很舒服，这个地段这样的价格包括免费网络还是很吸引人的。服务一般，早餐不错，算是对得起价格。只是有一点非常抹黑，门卫和部分X牌照小公司出租车100%有猫腻嫌疑，去机场严重绕路。此处暴光一下我所遭遇的车牌号为：AX1619，老外都看出绕了，真是给上海丢脸！作为一家四星级酒店，着实不应该有这类情况啊！,"The room is very large and comfortable. The price of this location, including the free network, is still very attractive.The service is average, and the breakfast is good, which is worth the price.It was just a little discredit. The gatekeeper and some X -licensed small companies were suspected of being tired of cats. They went to the airport seriously.The license plate number I encountered here is: AX1619, the foreigners have seen it, it is really embarrassing to Shanghai!As a four -star hotel, there should be no such situation!"
1,"在九龙旺角算香港很杂很乱不高档的地区,满街都是小混混靓仔.朗豪坊除了H&M没什么买都是地摊货．房间是香港一如既往的小，住惯了国内的旅客会觉得转不开身，大堂走廊还好吧，睡一觉而已．","In the area where Kowloon Mong Kok is very mixed in Hong Kong, there are no high -end regions, and the streets are full of small gangsters. Langham Fang except H & M has nothing to buy.The room is as small as in Hong Kong as always. Passengers who are used to lives in China will feel that they can't turn their bodies. The lobby corridor is okay, just sleep."
1,不错的酒店！就是入住时间得不到保证！下午3点以后到达仍说没房，几乎操国骂才拿到钥匙。,"Good hotel!It is not guaranteed to check in!After arriving at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I still said that there was no room."
1,房间还不错，舒适。门口打车不太方便，有时候秩序比较乱。自助餐很不错。宾馆反馈2008年5月12日：感谢您的入住及宝贵意见！建议下次退房时通知前台同事需要叫车服务，以节省您的时间。,"The room is pretty good and comfortable.Taxi at the door is not convenient, and sometimes the order is messy.The buffet is very good.Hotel feedback on May 12, 2008: Thank you for your check -in and valuable opinions!It is recommended to notify the front desk colleagues to call the car service next time to save your time."
1,好象新装修过了，各方面都很好。可是原来一次性的刮胡子刀没有了，希望能继续提供。,"It seems that the new decoration has been renovated, and all aspects are very good.But the original one -time scraping knife was gone, I hope to continue to provide it."
1,大床房的大床象在家里一样舒服，环境好。早餐品种不多，味道还行。,"The big beds of the big bed room are as comfortable at home and the environment is good.There are not many breakfast varieties, and the taste is okay."
1,既然是豪华“双人房”，为什么只是“单早”？出差时住同一房间的2同事，只能1位饿肚子了（每天报销的餐饮费有限）。早餐味道蛮好，就是品种不多。,"Since it is a luxurious ""double room"", why is it just ""early""?Two colleagues who live in the same room when traveling on a business trip can only be hungry (the daily reimbursement is limited).The breakfast tastes pretty good, but there are not many varieties."
1,"原先订豪华房,获提升至行政房,看似分别不大,只是多了一份早餐,但在行政楼层内的早餐非常简单,选择极少!正常入住行政房应该有生果盘,可能我是获提升所以没有提供,感觉酒店有点少气.房间面积大,床大,家私摆设都具五星标准.那个花园泳池环境不错,只是那边的服务员态度不够诚恳,需要再加培训.","Originally booked a luxurious house, which was promoted to the administrative house, it seemed that it was not large, but there was one more breakfast, but the breakfast in the administrative floor was very simple, and there were very few choices! There should be a raw fruit plate in the administrative house normally. Maybe I am that I am.So it is not provided, I feel that the hotel is a bit of a bit of gas. The room area is large, the beds are large, and the private furnishings have five -star standards. The garden swimming pool environment is good, but the waiter's attitude over there is not sincere enough. You need to add training."
1,该酒店的性价比在北京已经算是不错了!值得去试试!!!,The cost -effectiveness of the hotel is already good in Beijing! It is worth trying !!!
1,"价格不高,比较实惠,服务也不错,离闹市区不远.交通也比较方便.","The price is not high, it is more affordable, the service is also good, not far from the downtown area. Transportation is also more convenient."
1,酒店感觉很不错，服务态度很好，就是房间的温度太高了，打不下来，感觉有点闷！其他各方面都很不错！洗手间也比较大。1楼餐厅的西餐味道蛮好的。宾馆反馈2008年1月23日：谢谢您的夸奖，房间温度太高我们已经相关调整中了，相信下次您再次入住时问题肯定解决了．我们酒店全体员工恭候您的再次光临！,"The hotel feels very good, the service attitude is very good, that is, the temperature of the room is too high, it can't be hit, it feels a bit boring!Other aspects are very good!The bathroom is also relatively large.The western food on the first floor of the restaurant tastes pretty good.Hotel feedback on January 23, 2008: Thank you for your compliment. The room temperature is too high. We have already been adjusted. I believe that the problem will definitely solve the problem next time you stay in again.All our hotel employees are waiting for you to visit again!"
1,对该酒店还是比较满意的不管在硬件设施还是软件设施上都是不错的和该酒店的星级还是满符合的,The hotel is still more satisfied with both hardware facilities and software facilities.
1,硬件设施，前台服务，房间服务都不错，值得表扬。早餐种类也还算丰富，6点半就有了，这点不错。宾馆门童服务很好，唯一需要批评的是门口的保安，有个胖胖的，脸上有颗痣的中年人，对待宾客态度粗暴，这点很难想象，减分不少。我觉得宾馆人事部门应该考虑换掉，毕竟事关脸面上的服务水准。,"Hardware facilities, front desk services, room services are good, worthy of praise.The types of breakfast are also rich, and it is available at 6:30, which is good.The hotel door children's service is very good. The only thing that needs to be criticized is the security guard at the door. There is a middle -aged man with a fat and a mole on his face. It is difficult to imagine this and reduce points.I think the hotel's personnel department should consider replacing it, after all, the service level on the face is closed."
1,"性价比还是不错的,房间也很干净,周围也比较安静,唯一的缺点就是房间有点小,我住的大床房间","The cost -effectiveness is still good, the room is very clean, and the surroundings are relatively quiet. The only disadvantage is that the room is a bit small, and the big bed room I live in"
1,比较干净，适合居住。唯一感觉不好的一点是，早晨出门打车不是很方便，奇怪的是酒店大门对着的是比较重要的街道，但是出租车很难等，不知道是什么原因。,"It's relatively clean and suitable for living.The only thing that doesn't feel good is that it is not very convenient to go out in the morning. The strange thing is that the hotel door is facing a more important street, but it is difficult to wait for taxis. I do n’t know why."
1,蚊子比较多，价格还算可以，房间比较小，周边环境还可以吧。,"There are more mosquitoes, the price is okay, the room is relatively small, and the surrounding environment is okay."
1,服务很好，房间尤其是床很不错，但空调有点吵；位置有点难找，但离国展和后海都不远，在蒋宅口，或者沿外馆斜街走到鼓楼外大街都有公车可坐，坐地铁要往南走10分钟到安定门。这里要提一点，结帐的时候走得匆忙，服务员竟然忘了把押金退回给我，在机场打电话回去问，折腾了几次，终于找到经手人，并答应把钱打回我的信用卡。如果这个问题解决了，对这家酒店印象还是很不错的。,"The service is very good, the room, especially the bed, is very good, but the air conditioner is a bit noisy; the location is a bit difficult to find, but it is not far from the national exhibition and Houhai.You can sit, take the subway to the south for 10 minutes to the Anding Gate.I have to mention it here. When I check out, I hurriedly went. The waiter had forgotten to return the deposit to me. I called back to ask at the airport. After a few tosses, I finally found the scriptures and promised to return the money back to my credit card.If this problem is solved, the impression of this hotel is still very good."
1,比较有特色，服务也不错。跟他们要了洗衣粉和衣架，很快就拿来了。,"More distinctive and good service.I asked them for washing powder and hanger, and it was quickly brought."
1,环境非常有特点，古色古香，就在鲁迅故里附近，旅游的话建议可以住来感受感受。但是房间设施就一般般了，也可以理解，老房子的底子，如果对住宿条件要求比较高的话还是建议不要选择，尤其是无窗大床房。由客栈往鲁迅故居去经过的桥边的那摊臭豆腐味道确实很不错，价格也公道，建议可以尝尝,"The environment is very distinctive and antique. It is near Lu Xun's hometown. If you travel, it is recommended to live and feel it.However, the room facilities are average, and it can be understood that the foundation of the old house, if the accommodation conditions are relatively high, it is recommended not to choose, especially the large -window large bed room.The stinky tofu from the bridge that passed by from the Inn to Lu Xun's former residence is really good, and the price is fair. It is recommended to try it."
1,"酒店很有特色,地点也好,离鲁迅故居非常近.酒店提供火车站接站服务,火车到站30分钟左右打电话过去就能安排人接.这点携程要求提前24小时提供接站时间比较苛刻,每天那么多班火车,也不用提前那么久买火车票的嘛!这点希望携程能改进,不然干脆直接让客人到站前联系酒店就好了.","The hotel is very distinctive, the location is very close, and the former residence of Lu Xun is very close. The hotel provides a railway station to pick up the service. The train can call people to pick up in about 30 minutes.There are so many trains every day without having to buy a train ticket for so long in advance! I hope that Ctrip can improve it, otherwise the guests just let the guests contact the hotel in front of the station."
1,"总的来说不错,但是茶楼不怎么样!行政间台士电脑还可以,上网速度超快.","In general, it is not bad, but the tea house is not good! The administrative Burst computer is OK, the Internet speed is super fast."
1,感觉还不错，液晶电视，配有电脑。位置很好,"It feels pretty good, LCD TV, equipped with a computer.Good position"
1,"城市不错,房间也很好,很大的房间和床,就是前台服务不是很及时.","The city is good, the room is also very good, the large room and bed, that is, the front desk service is not very timely."
1,"房间还是可以,比较大.但是不是很隔音,早餐比较丰富,就是水果少点.","The room is still large, but it is not very sound insulation. The breakfast is relatively rich, that is, there are less fruits."
1,"我是10月5日到万豪住了一个晚上,说真的绝对不能和五星级酒店联系在一起.服务意识确实不错,但晚上以后好象酒店自己有一个象是夜总会的地方,音乐响到凌晨2点多,嘈死人了.以后再也不去住了.","I went to Marriott on October 5 for a night on October 5th.At 2 o'clock in the morning, I was noisy. I won't live again in the future."
1,1）交通便利，到津滨高速入口5分钟的车程2）对面就有不错的饭店，而且距离超市也不远3）房间内设施一般，卫生间装修比较粗糙，浴盆的地漏不畅,"1) Convenient transportation, 5 minutes at the Jinbin High -speed entrance 2) There are good restaurants opposite, and not far from the supermarket. 3) The facilities in the room are general, the bathroom decoration is rough, the floor drain in the bathtub is not smooth"
1,位置不错，就在大水车旁边不远的地方，如果有很多行李的话，这里是一个不错的选择。酒店的环境还不错，我们住的房子前面有个院子，每天都可以坐在院子里看书晒太阳，还挺舒服的。不过说起来，古城里的客栈也都差不多。服务挺热情。价钱算是古城客栈里比较高的了。,"The location is good, just not far next to the Dashiwater truck. If there are a lot of luggage, this is a good choice.The environment of the hotel is not bad. There is a yard in front of the house we live in. It is quite comfortable to sit in the yard to read the sun every day.But speaking, the inn in the ancient city is almost the same.The service is enthusiastic.The price is relatively high in the ancient city inn."
1,该死的写程，我打2分根本发表不了评论！这次我给你打4分，但还是实话实说，这个酒店不咋样，给我二楼最里间的房子，紧靠锅炉房，木结构的房子里面烧锅炉，多可怕啊！当时看写程的评论写的天花乱坠，原来都是假的，给低分的评论根本发表不了，真假。,"Damn the schedule, I can't comment at 2 points at all!This time I scored 4 points for you, but to be honest, this hotel is not good. Give me the innermost house on the second floor, close to the boiler room, and the wooden -structured house is burned in the boiler. How terrible!At that time, the smallpox written by the comments of the writing journey were all false, and the low -scoring comments could not be published at all, true and false."
1,"是个环境不错的地方,离古城入口也比较近,入住的寿苑比较安静也很干净.不足的是楼上的脚步声能听得见,隔音不是很好.",It is a place with a good environment. It is closer to the entrance of the ancient city. The Shouyuan who stays in is relatively quiet and clean. The lack of footsteps can be heard on the footsteps upstairs. The sound insulation is not very good.
1,6月初蜜月旅行，到达丽江的第一晚入住。房间很整洁，木质的家具感觉非常舒服，很有古朴的味道，与庭院的风格非常接近，一下子就喜欢上了！以后去的话还会住在这里。,"Traveling in the early June, arrived at the first night of Lijiang.The room is very neat, wooden furniture feels very comfortable, very simple, and is very close to the style of the courtyard. I like it all at once!If you go in the future, you will live here."
1,房间不大，布置还行。里火车站较近。（打的9元）,"The room is not large, and the layout is okay.The railway station is closer.(9 yuan)"
1,这次订的是无窗的房间，房间很大，就是没有窗户，没有风景，不过住的时候就是睡觉无所谓了，感觉算超值的,"This time I booked a windowless room. The room is large, but there are no windows and landscapes, but it doesn't matter when you live."
1,福建山水大酒店1、看来升4★还是有道理的，服务不错（专人接待和洗衣能比较及时地送达）；2、早餐的皮蛋瘦肉粥不错（尽管第三天早上的有点糊味）；3、二楼的餐饮值得推荐（招待客户时）；4、设备比较齐备，有棋牌室，尽管没去打麻将，看了看环境还可以；5、地理位置不错，窗户对面居然就是－洲际酒店，但打车比洲际方便很多；6、房间上网速度不错，有600KB/s的样子；7、不足嘛：A、福州酒店好像都是一样的问题－－房间购大，但厕所比较小，尤其是马桶的Size……；B、二楼的餐饮无商务套餐，结果比较浪费（按单人50元餐饮计算），已提过此建议，不知是否会改进；C、房间窗户隔音效果比较差。我住在16楼，第一天刮小台风，窗户震了一夜。第二天白天和第三天白天，楼下某车警报器发癫似的直冲云霄……好在房间有个小音响，开到3/4格音量放着摇滚，感觉居然还不错……D、明显存在的问题：8号中午一点多结账时，结果结账的地方才1个人（而且还在忙着统计“对账单”），同一个柜台的接待处却有3个人，而此时并无Checkin的客人，但接待的3人“无动于衷”……（为赶回来看奥运会开幕式，只好要求她们加快或来一个人来帮忙）结果又遇到刷卡有问题。我还没急，结账的那位却风风火火只会把卡左刷右刷的刷了n次（完全无视系统的“报错提醒”）我再三提醒看“请看看是什么错误信息”，才知道是余额不足。只好分别回房间和到商务中心，共转帐二次，结果还是刷卡错误－－回来后问银行柜台咨询才知道是：因为短时间内刷卡太频繁，银行保护把卡锁了……其实：中午时间本来就是CheckOut人比较多的时候（从我开始结账到结账完毕，共有四位客人在Checkout，却无人Checkin），前台人员配备明显不合理；如果结账的那位女同志仔细一点，发现刷卡有问题时多看下提示，就不会耽误客人如此多的时间，而且不会导致锁卡（好彩为看开幕式归心似箭，提前了1个小时CheckOut，否则……）；出现问题时，请冷静点处理，居然比我还急（尤其是她那说话的声音又高又尖又快），如果我也象她那么样急一下，不吵架才怪……当然，酒店的服务从始至终，包括最后处理卡问题时知道换另外一位接待来处理，服务态度还是可以接受的，总体上此酒店还是值得推荐的，希望能百尺竿头更进一步。最后，携程的价格比我在前台听的某价格贵了少许，虽然我接受了此价差入住了，但携程还请加油！,"Fujian Shanshui Hotel 1. It seems that rising 4 ★ It still makes sense, good service (special reception and laundry can be delivered in time); 2. Breakfast preserved egg lean meat porridge is good (although the third morning is a bit confused in the morning of the morning); Catering on the second floor is worth recommending (when enterting customers); 4. The equipment is relatively complete, there are chess and card rooms, although they did not go to play mahjong, it is okay to see the environment;Intercontinental hotels, but taxi is much more convenient than intercontinental; 6. The room speed of the room is good, it looks like 600KB/s; 7. Insufficient: A. The Fuzhou Hotel seems to be the same problem -the room purchase is large, but the toilet is relatively small, but the toilet is relatively small, but the toilet is relatively small, but the toilet is relatively small, but the toilet is relatively small, but the toilet is relatively small, but the toilet is relatively small, but the toilet is relatively small, but the toilet is relatively small, but the toilet is relatively small, but the toilet is relatively small, but the toilet is relatively small, but the toilet is relatively small, but the toilet is relatively small, but the toilet is relatively small, but the toilet is relatively small.Especially the size of the toilet ...; B and the second floor catering without a business package, the result is relatively wasteful (calculated at 50 yuan for a single person). I have mentioned this suggestion and I wonder if it will be improved.EssenceI lived on the 16th floor. On the first day, I scraped a small typhoon, and the window shook overnight.The next day and the third day of the day, a car warmer downstairs was like a small sound of the swelling of the clouds ... Fortunately, there was a small sound in the room, and the volume of the 3/4 grid was put on the rock. It felt pretty good ...D. Obviously existing problems: At noon at noon on the 8th, only one person at the time of checkout (and is still busy counting the ""statement""), but there are 3 people at the reception of the same counter. At this timeThe guests without Checkin, but the three people were ""indifferent"" ... (In order to rush back to see the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games, they had to ask them to speed up or come to help alone.) As a result, there was a problem with swiping cards.I'm not in a hurry yet, but the one who checks out will only swipe the card to the right and right brush and swipe it N times (the ""Reminder of the Error Reminder"" at all).The balance is insufficient.I had to go back to the room and the business center separately, and transfer it twice a total of twice.It was when there were more Checkout people (from the start of the checkout to the checkout, a total of four guests were at Checkout, but no one checkin). The front desk staff is obviously unreasonable. If the lesbian who checks out, I find that there is a more close -ups and found that there is a credit card.Please calm down, it is even more anxious than me (especially her voice is tall, sharp, and faster). If I am so anxious, I don't blame it if I don't quarrel ... Of course, the hotel's service from the beginning toIn the end, when I do the problem with the final processing card, I know that I will be handled by another reception. The service attitude is still acceptable. Generally, this hotel is worth recommending. I hope that it can go further in a hundred feet.In the end, Ctrip's price was a little more expensive than a certain price I heard at the front desk. Although I accepted this price difference, Ctrip please come on!"
1,酒店地理位置很不错，很适合逛街入住。但是房间似乎开始有些成旧的感觉了（特别是卫生间），还有前台小姐的服务态度有待改进。补充点评2008年7月29日：还有，早餐品种太差了，没什么东西好吃。,"The location of the hotel is very good, and it is very suitable for shopping.However, the room seems to be a little old (especially the bathroom), and the service attitude of the front desk lady needs to be improved.Supplementary comment on July 29, 2008: Also, the breakfast variety is too bad, nothing is delicious."
1,地理位置比较市中心，早餐厅品种比较少，服务一般。,"The geographical location is compared with the city center. There are fewer breakfast rooms, and the service is average."
1,还过的去拉。嘉兴也没社么好地方住。就是服务员早上说话太大声，扰人睡觉啊。～～大家别去定那个社么忆江南大酒店，O原来定的那里，过去1看，人都没的。前台2个服务员在聊天，没照片上的样子好，是个KTV和浴室一起的1个招待所。协程找这样的酒店，也不怕砸自己招牌。～～,"Go and pull.Jiaxing also has no social place to live in a good place.It is the waiter who speaks too loudly in the morning and disturb people to sleep.~~ Don't settle in the community, recall the Jiangnan Hotel, O, where it was originally set. In the past 1, no one.The two waiters at the front desk are chatting. It looks good in the photo. It is a guest house in KTV and the bathroom.Finding such a hotel is not afraid of smashing your signboard.~ ~"
1,宾馆的地理位置很好，还远处有一个超市；环境也很好；房间很干净，服务员服务态度很好。,"The hotel's geographical location is very good, and there is a supermarket in the distance; the environment is also very good; the room is very clean, and the waiter's service attitude is very good."
1,温泉很大，喜欢室外的部分，空气非常好，就是水温大都偏热。室内的品种也很多，不过价格还是偏贵的。离市区还是很远的，吃饭的选择不多。,"The hot spring is very large. I like the outdoor part. The air is very good, but most of the water temperature is hot.There are also many types of indoor, but the price is still expensive.It is still far from the urban area, and there are not many choices for meals."
1,服务很好，进房间服务员会给你倒一杯茶水，很温馨，硬件虽然差一些，但性价比很高，下次去还住山水,"The service is very good. Entering the room will give you a cup of tea. It is very warm. Although the hardware is worse, the cost performance is very high. I will live in the landscape next time"
1,地理位置很好，风景美丽，环境宁静。硬件比一般的三星级好。,"The geographical location is very good, the scenery is beautiful, and the environment is quiet.Hardware is better than ordinary Samsung."
1,"客房楼的外观看起来很旧,但是房间还不错,很干净,设施也比较新,总的来说,性价比不错.免费注册网站导航宾馆索引服务说明关于携程诚聘英才代理合作广告业务联系我们Copyright1999-2008,ctrip.com.allrightsreserved.","The appearance of the guest room building looks very old, but the room is not bad, very clean, and the facilities are relatively new. In general, the cost performance is good. Free registered website navigation hotel index service description.-2008, ctrip.com.allrightsReserved."
1,定的高级房，免费升级到豪华房，不错的。海景不错，就是电视差了点，最起码也应该弄个液晶嘛；价格没竞争力，与前台一个价，所谓的果盘也没见到。,"The fixed high -end room is upgraded to luxury rooms for free.The sea view is good, that is, the TV is a bit worse. At least, it should be a LCD; the price is not competitive, and the price is the same as the front desk. The so -called fruit plate is not seen."
1,除了地理位置、外部境不会再方座相、服比、性非常高。速漫BusinessMan不便、前台的熟度尚差、需要努力。,"Except for geographical location, the external situation will not be available, the ratio is very high, and the sex is very high.The inconvenience of the fast businessman is inconvenient, the maturity of the front desk is still poor, and it needs to work hard."
1,酒店位于福州最热闹的东街口，出来吃饭购物逛街都十分方便。商务单人大床间房间够宽敞，还配有液晶电脑，很方便。尤其值得一提的是酒店的服务，非常棒！每天晚上都有楼层服务生专门送来的小点心和温馨的明日天气提示及当日报纸，感觉很贴心。下次来福州还会选择这家。就冲这么贴心的服务也觉得很值得。,"The hotel is located in the most lively Dongjiekou of Fuzhou. It is very convenient to come out to eat and go shopping.The room in the bed in the business of the business is spacious and equipped with LCD computers, which is very convenient.It is particularly worth mentioning that the service of the hotel is great!Every night, there are floors and warm weather tips and newspapers that are sent by floor waiters and warm weather tomorrow. It feels very intimate.Next time you come to Fuzhou, you will choose this one.It is worth such intimate service."
1,"K-BarBase到深夜2点才停、比合末使用。CheckOut将衣服忘却在Room,酒店特意保管利取回、非常感！","K-Barbase stopped at 2 o'clock in the middle of the night and used it at the end.Checkout forgets the clothes at Room, the hotel deliberately keeps it back and feels very much!"
1,总体来说还是不错的。特别幽静，风景怡人，还可以看到孔雀，鸟鸣在那里不是什么奇事。房间很古典，很有味道~交通不是很方便哦~适合度假跟调节心情~据说月亮河是那里的富人区呢~,"Overall, it is quite good.It is particularly quiet and pleasant, you can also see the peacock, it is not a strange thing that birds are there.The room is very classic and delicious ~ traffic is not very convenient ~ Suitable for vacation and regulating mood ~ It is said that the Moon River is the rich area there ~"
1,"酒店位子不好找外,前台服务还需提高.其它还不错.","The hotel seat is not easy to find, the front desk service needs to be improved. Others are not bad."
1,"房间够大,服务不错.下次有机会还会去住.",The room is big enough and the service is good. I will live in the next time.
1,"酒店环境还算安静,离古城有点距离,好在出租车价格便宜,早餐一般.房间装修很新,还很赋现代感,干净,整体房间设计舒适,人性化.房间打扫人员也很仔细.还算是不错的选择.补充点评2007年11月23日：市内外的电话是免费打的,很贴心.该服务不错.","The hotel environment is quite quiet, a little distance from the ancient city. Fortunately, the price of taxis is cheap, and the breakfast is average. The room decoration is very new, and it is very modern. The overall room design is comfortable.It is a good choice. Supplementary reviews November 23, 2007: The phone inside and outside the city is free, very intimate. The service is good."
1,酒店按照3星级标准建造，建成不满2年，设备都挺新的。总体来说符合3星级的标准。属于凤凰地区最好的酒店之一了吧。就是价格也不算便宜。,"The hotel is built in accordance with the 3 -star standard. It has been built for less than 2 years, and the equipment is quite new.Overall meet the 3 -star standard.One of the best hotels in the Phoenix area.The price is not cheap."
1,服务还可以，就是房内设施太陈旧。早餐比较差！,"The service is okay, that is, the facilities in the house are too old.Breakfast is worse!"
1,房间有点小。但总的来说还不错，尤其是电话免费、宽带免费。在阜阳应该是最好的了。,"The room is a bit small.But in general, it is pretty good, especially for free phone calls and free broadband.It should be the best in Fuyang."
1,没有行李员、淋浴房的门不挡水、水温忽冷忽热、马桶不够干净、早餐没什么吃的、前台服务算不清帐、不专业。,"There are no luggagers, the door of the shower room is not blocked, the water temperature is cold and hot, the toilet is not clean enough, the breakfast is not eaten, the front desk service is not clear, and it is unprofessional."
1,优点：位置是挺好的，离火车站很近，离中央大街、兆麟公园都很近，我们去的时候都徒步来去了这些地方；服务还可以；前台应变能力不错；劣势：普通间的水太小太小了，水温还不好控制，淋浴房也太小了；名气不是太大，几个出租车司机都还是由我们自己给他们指的路。,"Advantages: The location is very good, it is very close to the train station, it is very close to the Central Avenue and Zhaolin Park. When we go, we will walk around these places; the service is OK;The water is too small and too small, the water temperature is not easy to control, and the shower room is too small; the fame is not too large. A few taxi drivers are still the way we pointed to them."
1,该酒店住宿条件比想像中好，运气好的话房间里还会有除湿机，除湿机用途很广，可以在雨天的时候把鞋子烘干，洗的衣服也很快就干了。另外饭店还为住客提供电吹风，感动啊（到了那里就会明白为什么那么需要电吹风了）！不过黄山上吃的东西真的很贵，饭店80元一人的自助餐就吃了几根黄瓜和萝卜小排汤，当时又累又饿，一行十人也都不计较了，这些菜对刚刚爬完天都峰和光明顶的人来说简直就是美味了，呵呵。其实如果节约点也还是可以在餐厅吃的，两个人可以叫一份蛋炒饭（38元）和一碗番茄蛋汤，量很大，可以供3-4个人吃了。唯一不足的是饭店的位置不好，光明顶在该饭店和天都峰中间，因此此行爬了两次光明顶，彻底达到了锻炼的目的，所以大家要先安排好游程路线，不然也要象我们一样，从早上8点爬到晚上6点了，对此当地导游把我们一行人当成了疯子，哈哈。黄山值得一去啊！,"The hotel's accommodation conditions are better than expected. If you are lucky, there will be dehumidifiers in the room. The dehumidifier is widely used. You can dry the shoes during rainy days, and the clothes you washed will be dried soon.In addition, the restaurant also provides guests with hair dryers and moved (you will understand why you need a hair dryer there when you get there)!However, the food on Huangshan is really expensive. The buffet of 80 yuan a person ate a few cucumbers and radish soup. At that time, he was tired and hungry.Tiandufeng and Guangming top are just delicious, haha.In fact, if you save points, you can still eat it in the restaurant. Two people can call a piece of egg fried rice (38 yuan) and a bowl of tomato egg soup. The amount is very large and can be used for 3-4 people.The only disadvantage is that the location of the restaurant is not good. The light is in the middle of the hotel and Tiandu Peak. Therefore, this trip climbed twice the light top to achieve the purpose of exercise.Like us, we climbed from 8 am to 6 pm. In this regard, the local tour guide regarded us as a lunatic, haha.Huangshan is worth going!"
1,入住两晚，总体感觉还可以。和网上前人说的差不多。环境和服务不错，房间就能看到湖，衣架较多。但房间地毯较脏，而且还有蚊子。可能不是周末，人非常少，第一天早餐没开自助餐。东西够吃饱但不精。晚餐的沙锅大鱼头一般，不如秀水人家的好，还贵，胡椒味太重。从酒店较车比外面贵些。,"Two nights for staying, the overall feeling is okay.It's almost the same as the online person.The environment and services are good, and the room can be seen in the room, and there are more hams.But the carpet in the room is dirty and mosquito.It may not be on weekends. There are very few people. The first day of breakfast did not open a buffet.Things are enough but not fine.The big fish head of the casserole of dinner is generally not as good as the beautiful people, but also expensive, and the pepper taste is too heavy.The hotel is more expensive than the outside."
1,酒店离千岛湖景区码头稍微远了点，不过上杭千高速比较方便，也很安静。这次订的标准间还有个小阳台，空气很好，可以看到湖景和广场的音乐喷泉。总的来说还是不错的.,"The hotel is a little farther away from the Qiandao Lake Scenic Area Pier, but it is more convenient and quiet in Shanghang Qianxia high speed.There is also a small balcony in this standard room. The air is very good. You can see the music fountain in the lake and square.Overall it is good."
1,"看了别人的评分才决定订这个酒店的,相对来说地点偏了点，但是价格方面还是蛮优惠的228元.还送了两瓶水和两份早餐.酒店也蛮安静的,也蛮干净的.入住和退房也蛮块的.服务也可以.总的来说蛮好的","After watching the score of others, I decided to book this hotel. Relatively speaking, the location was a bit off, but the price is still 228 yuan. I also gave two bottles of water and two breakfast.It is also quite blocking in check -in and check -in. The service is okay. In general, it is pretty good"
1,住的是标准间B，酒店整体性价比较高（在上海），房间还比较新，干净整洁。离商圈不算远，离地铁站很近。服务人员很热情。房间大小也可以，个人觉得比经济型连锁酒店好，（如如家、7天、汉庭、莫泰168等）缺点是床不太好。另外不提供赠水。没有抽手纸。建议改正一下。,"Living in the standard room B, the hotel's overall price is relatively high (in Shanghai), the room is still relatively new, clean and tidy.Not far from the business district, it is close to the subway station.The service staff is very enthusiastic.The size of the room is also available. Personally, I feel that the disadvantage of the bed (such as home, 7 days, Han Ting, Motai 168, etc.) is that the bed is not very good.In addition, no gift is provided.There is no hand -drawn paper.It is recommended to correct it."
1,已住好次，次新修的，房感更好了，不淋浴的下水特慢，不知道是所有房的是只有608的。因太晚了所以找修，希望能修一下。,"I have lived well, and I have a better sense of room. The room feels better. I do n’t know if it ’s only 608 in all houses.Because it is too late, I hope to repair it, I hope to repair it."
1,"总体来说,在上海这样的大都会,海","Overall, in the Metropolitan Metropolitan, the Hai, the sea"
1,"一个非常不错的太湖边酒店,我的运气不错，本来订的是一般房间，结果被升级到了行政套房.酒店拥有绝美的风景，太湖就近在眼前,早上起来或者下午的时候，坐在房间里喝喝茶,看看风景别有风味.不过，似乎这个酒店住的人比较少，有点冷清,而且周围吃喝不大方便，开车出去要10多分钟，才能找到吃饭的地方.","A very good Taihu Hotel, I am lucky. I originally booked a general room. As a result, it was upgraded to the administrative suite. The hotel has beautiful scenery.Drink tea in it, look at the landscape without flavor. However, it seems that there are relatively few people living in this hotel, a bit deserted, and it is not convenient to eat and drink around. It takes more than 10 minutes to drive out to find the place to eat."
1,酒店的设施和环境有五星的标准。但酒店的服务绝对没有同样的水准。我14点到酒店的，房间没有整理好。30分种上房间，依旧在整理中，期间得到的唯一答复是：五一客人多，来不及整理。没有任何其他的表示。补充点评2007年5月7日：和酒店高达1400的房费相比，其服务水准实在不能相比。,"The hotel's facilities and environment have five -star standards.But the hotel's service is definitely not the same level.I arrived at the hotel at 14 o'clock, and the room was not sorted out.30 points to the room are still sorting out. The only reply during the period is that there are many guests in May, so they are too late to sort out.No other representation.Supplementary comment on May 7, 2007: Compared with the housing fee of up to 1400 in the hotel, its service level cannot be compared with."
1,被单太旧了，盖得有点难受，应该尽快换新的。吃饭的地方应该有点特色，不知道吃什么好,"It is too old to be covered, and it is a bit uncomfortable. You should change the new one as soon as possible.The place to eat should be a bit unique, I don’t know what to eat"
1,天清岛度假酒店，自然风景很好，优于天元度假村。位置偏僻，适合团队和自驾游。设施一般，相比天元，差距很大。早餐足够丰盛，质量也很好。酒店自制的面包和小点心非常好吃，尤其推荐枣泥蛋糕。早餐培根特别好，广受欢迎，水果的品质也不错。中餐厅的正餐就没什么特色了，味道一般，好在价格没有贵得离谱。开元的中餐厅味道确实很好，除了鱼头，我们对那个过油四季豆印象很深，味道独特，很好吃。关于房间：天清岛酒店共9个楼。1-8号为一个整体，呈蛇形排列，共5层，1层是停车库，2-5层客房。大堂位于中间，左侧是1、2号，右侧依次是3、4、5、6、7、8号。9号楼在岛上是看不到的，位于停车坪和草坪的下面，只有2层，紧邻湖水，要在水上或山对面才能看见正面。1-9号所有房间都是景观房，有观景阳台。房间景观首推9号楼，阳台下面就是湖水，远处是岛屿和层峦，视线开阔无遮拦，有水墨画的写意韵味。“缺点”是有点单调。这也是天清岛和开元最大的差别所在。开元胜在装修和园林景观，精致豪华且丰富多彩，天清岛胜在天水合一的自然景观，没有人工雕饰，但略显单调。选择哪里，要看个人喜好。9号楼的阳台上有茶几和太阳椅，坐在外面看风景、扮风景时，别忘了带个望远镜。我们订到一天豪华房，第二天在房间一直耗到中午才离开。冲杯咖啡，在阳台上看湖面驶过的游船和快艇，再望望远山，非常悠闲惬意。4、5号楼的景观与9号不相上下，面向辽阔的湖水，视线最为开阔，且站的高看的远。有人说隔条马路才是湖面，我觉得这不是问题，因为楼前有酒店的园林绿化，反而丰富了景观效果。这里特别提醒，如果不是一定要睡大床，酒店2张1米2宽单人床的标准间最为实惠。因为湖景大床房全部安排在景观不佳的6号楼，房间大小、设施没有区别，价格却高于其他楼的湖景标间，不划算。之后依次是7、3、6、8号。所谓景观不佳，就是视角逊色、不够开阔。我们第二晚换到6号楼大床房，正对一个小水湾。看出去青山碧水，也很美，但在千岛湖，这样的景观实在不足为奇。虽然站到阳台上也能看到旁边的辽阔水面，但相对4、5号楼，就逊色许多。我们同行的人住在3号楼，因为处在折线中，要站在阳台上左望，才能看到主湖区。7号楼就好些，我没机会进去，看角度优于其他。订房时除了景观还要考虑位置，8号楼因为在酒店最远端，视线也一般，所以游客都不愿意问津。但8号也有优势，旁边就是易主题文化公园，去那里参观很方便。1、2号楼就不是我们散客光顾的了，都是套房和复式，我看景观也不大好。还要提醒一点，9号楼的玻璃淋浴间是瓷砖地面，踩上去冰凉，在秋冬季可不怎么舒服。备用的橡胶脚垫脏脏的，最好不用。,"Tianqing Island Resort, the natural scenery is very good, better than Tianyuan Resort.The location is remote, suitable for teams and self -driving tour.The facilities are average. Compared with Tianyuan, there is a large gap.Breakfast is abundant enough and the quality is very good.The hotel's homemade bread and snacks are very delicious, especially for jujube mud cakes.Bacon Bacon is particularly good, popular, and the quality of fruits is also good.There is no special feature in the Chinese restaurant, and the taste is average. Fortunately, the price is not expensive.Kaiyuan's Chinese restaurant is really good. In addition to the fish head, we have a deep impression on that over -oil bean, unique and delicious.About the room: There are 9 buildings in Tianqing Island Hotel.No. 1-8 is a whole, arranged in a snake-shaped, 5 floors, 1 floor is a parking garage, 2-5-story rooms.The lobby is located in the middle, on the left is No. 1 and 2, and the right side is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.Building 9 is not visible on the island. It is located under the parking and lawn. There are only 2 floors. It is close to the lake. It is necessary to see the front on the water or the opposite mountain.All rooms 1-9 are landscape rooms with viewing balconies.The landscape of the room is the first to push Building 9. Below the balcony is the lake, the island and the mountains in the distance.""Disadvantages"" is a bit monotonous.This is also the biggest difference between Tianqing Island and Kaiyuan.Kaiyuan Sheng is decorated and garden landscapes, exquisite and luxurious and colorful. Tianqing Island is victorious in the natural landscape of Tianshui. There is no artificial carving, but it is slightly monotonous.Where to choose depends on personal preferences.There is a coffee table and sun chair on the balcony of Building 9. When sitting outside and watching the scenery and playing the scenery, don't forget to bring a telescope.We booked a luxury room for a day, and the next day it was consumed until noon before leaving.Cup coffee, watch the cruise ships and speedboats passing by the lake on the balcony, and look at the Yuanshan again.The landscape of Building 4 and 5 is comparable to the 9th, facing the vast lake water, the most open sight, and the high view.Some people say that the road across the road is the lake. I think this is not a problem, because there is a hotel greening in front of the building, which has enriched the landscape effect.Here are a reminder that if you do n’t have to sleep in a large bed, the standard room for 2 1 meters and 2 wide single beds in the hotel is the most affordable.Because the large lake scenes are all arranged in the No. 6 Building 6 of the landscape. The size of the room and the facilities are not different, but the price is higher than the lake scene room of other buildings. It is not cost -effective.Later, on the 7th, 3rd, 6th, 8th.The so -called poor landscape is inferior to the perspective and is not open enough.We changed to a large bed in Building 6 the next night, facing a small water bay.It is also beautiful to see the green mountains and water, but in Qiandao Lake, this landscape is not surprising.Although you can also see the vast water next to the balcony, it is much inferior compared to Building 4 and 5.We live in Building 3, because we are in the folding line, and we must stand on the balcony to see the main lake area.Building 7 is better. I have no chance to go in, and the angle is better than others.In addition to the landscape when reservation, the location is also considered. Because Building 8 is the farthest in the hotel and the sight is average, tourists are unwilling to ask.However, the 8th also has an advantage. It is the Yi theme Cultural Park next to it. It is convenient to visit there.Buildings 1 and 2 are not we are scattered by our customers. They are all suite and duplex. I don't see the landscape.Also reminded that the glass shower room in Building 9 is the ground on the floor of the tile, which is not comfortable in autumn and winter.The spare rubber foot pad is dirty, it is best not to use it."
1,8月底和女儿入住一晚，感觉不错，蛮亲切，一定要住三楼，在走廊上可远眺大半个古城，心旷神怡。房间稍小，但整洁，卫生间也不错，小院很静。如果真正要享受古城的感觉，个人觉得它是个不错的选择。如果要追求星级享受，那就去住王府，和玺。,"At the end of August, I stayed with my daughter for one night. I felt good and I was quite kind. Be sure to live on the third floor. In the corridor, you can overlook most of the ancient cities in a long distance.The room is slightly smaller, but it is neat, the bathroom is also good, and the courtyard is very quiet.If you really want to enjoy the feeling of the ancient city, personally think it is a good choice.If you want to pursue star -level enjoyment, go to the palace and seal."
1,这是我第二次入住瑞和园了，两次都是住在二楼04的房间。这次还发现房间新添置了一台联想电脑，非常体贴周到！400元一晚的价钱，还OK吧，对于背包客确实有点儿贵了，可对于那些希望静静休假，不被任何繁琐干扰的朋友们，我觉得是值得推荐的！来到丽江，住在瑞和园，每天都只呆在客栈看书喝茶已经值回票价了！下次再游古城，不用带电脑了，我想我还会继续选择瑞和园！,"This is the second time I have been in Ruiheyuan, and twice lived in the room 04 on the second floor.This time I also found that a new Lenovo computer was added to the room, which is very thoughtful!The price of 400 yuan a night, it's OK, it is a bit expensive for backpackers, but for those who want to have a quiet vacation and not be disturbed by any tedious interference, I think it is worth recommending!When you come to Lijiang, live in Ruihe Park, you have only stayed in the inn and read books and drink tea every day.Next time you visit the ancient city, you don't need to bring your computer anymore, I think I will continue to choose Ruihe Garden!"
1,休假时一个人去的，房间很干净整洁，家居装饰也很有古意，住那的时候正好老板的哥哥（客栈的设计者）也在，一个非常cute的纳西大叔，每天晚上就跟大家在茶室喝普洱、聊天、烤火，真的很开心噢，结果俺也买了两大袋茶叶回家泡，哈哈。跟古城其他客栈比，贵是贵了点，但胜在环境闹中取静，老板有趣，而且卫生间很干净，喜欢，下回去还住。,"During the vacation, I went alone, the room was clean and tidy, and the home decoration was very old. At that time, the boss's brother (designer of the inn) was also there.I was really happy to drink Pu'er, chat, and baked fire in the tea room. As a result, I also bought two big bags of tea to go home and foam, haha.Compared with other inn, it is a bit expensive, but it is better than the environment in the environment. The boss is interesting, and the bathroom is very clean."
1,印象最深的就是他们的床，舒服，大而柔软，睡过那么多床，他们家的可以算是最舒服的了，这也是我为什么会一直去的原因，可能也是唯一的原因吧！房间不大，属于小的，套房内的卧室除了一张床，电视机都是放在矮阳台上的，因为实在没地方了。外面在修路，周边环境一般，要吃饭或者是逛逛，都不是很方便。听说是美国一家高级连锁酒店，所以配套都比较规整。,"The most impressive is their bed, comfortable, large and soft, sleeping so many beds, their family can be regarded as the most comfortable. This is why I always go, it may be the only reason!The room is not large, it is a small one. Except for a bed in the bedroom in the suite, the TV is placed on a low balcony, because there is no place.It is not very convenient to repair the road outside and the surrounding environment. It is not very convenient to eat or stroll around.I heard that it is a senior chain hotel in the United States, so the supporting facilities are more regular."
1,这家酒店我已经入住多次，总体印象是好的，虽然大堂很小，但是房间整洁、温馨，一直以来都比较满意。但是这次让我有些失望，原因是我预定的是三间高级房，特别注明要两间大床房和一间双床房（一男三女），并且在收到携程的短信确认后，特意电话再次确认了一下，携程给出的答复是完全按照我的要求预定。但是当我到酒店checkin时，被告知房间不够了，只有一个两个双床和一间空调无法使用的大床房。我入住的时间刚好是冷空气将临的时候，没有热空调根本无法入住。多亏同行的男士比较体谅，提出他住有问题的房间。虽然当晚酒店最终挤出了一间空调可以使用的大床房，但是这个过程让人很不舒服。如果房间不足，应该在我们入住前提前通知，我们也好另作打算。这次只能说比较幸运，最终结果是好的，但是希望酒店的预订系统能够改进。另外，酒店没有给我们提供入住第一天的迎宾水果，2318房间的洗澡水温度不稳定，忽冷忽热，洗澡很不舒服。,"I have been in this hotel many times. The overall impression is good. Although the lobby is small, the room is clean and warm, and it has always been satisfied.But this time it disappointed me, because I booked three high -end houses, which specifically stated that two large beds and a double bed room (one man and three women) were specified. After receiving the SMS confirmation from Ctrip,The special call was confirmed again, and the answer given by Ctrip was to book exactly in accordance with my request.But when I went to the hotel checkin, I was told that the room was not enough. There were only two double beds and a large bed room that could not be used in an air conditioner.When I stayed in the cold air, the cold air was coming, and no hot air conditioner could not move at all.Thanks to the men who are peers are more considerate, he proposes to live in a problem with a problem.Although the hotel finally squeezed out a large bed where the air conditioner could use, this process was very uncomfortable.If the room is insufficient, we should notify before we stay in advance, and we can do another plan.This time I can only be said to be lucky, and the end result is good, but I hope the hotel's booking system can be improved.In addition, the hotel did not provide us with welcome fruits on the first day of staying. The temperature of the bath water in Room 2318 was unstable, cold and hot, and the bath was uncomfortable."
1,"酒店房间不错,还有厨房,就是大堂小了点.","The hotel room is good, and the kitchen, that is, the lobby is a little smaller."
1,我已经超过十次入住该饭店，交通很方便，公车计程车搭乘方便，但是厕所较小，其他还行，建议宽频应该免费。,"I have been in the hotel more than ten times. The transportation is very convenient. The bus is easy to take a taxi, but the toilet is small. Others are OK. It is recommended that the broadband should be free."
1,"地理位置不错,出门就是步行街.晚上没事了,出去吃当地的小吃很方便.相比宝龙,就显的旧了些.","The geographical location is good, it is walking on the pedestrian street. It's okay at night. It is convenient to go out to eat local snacks. Compared to Baolong, it is older."
1,"地理位置非常优越,机场大巴\地铁和公车几乎就在门口,但靠街的房间晚上可能会有点吵.","The geographical location is very superior. The airport bus \ subway and the bus are almost at the door, but the street room may be a bit noisy at night."
1,"跟众人评价的差不多,商务大床的房间比浦东店的要小很多.总体来说这个价位来讲设施还是蛮好的.宾馆反馈2008年7月8日：谢谢您对我们酒店的肯定，我们热诚期盼您的下次入住，为您提供更优质的服务。","Similar to everyone's evaluation, the room of the big business bed is much smaller than the Pudong store. Generally speaking, the facilities are quite good at this price. Hotel feedback on July 8, 2008: Thank you for your affirmation of our hotel, weI sincerely look forward to your next check -in and provide you with better services."
1,朋友住下来说比莫泰的好！其他的也不好说，自己没住过！宾馆反馈2008年6月27日：感谢您朋友对本酒店的认可，我们期待您的光临。,"My friend lives better than Motai!It's hard to say, I haven't lived!Hotel feedback on June 27, 2008: Thank you friends for their recognition of the hotel, and we look forward to your visit."
1,我们住的是商务标间，房间的面积还可以，但是不是很通风，有一股说不出的味道，而且隔音效果很差，基本上可以听到隔壁的人打呼的声音，很不舒服。早餐可以吃的东西太少了，但是味道还可以。离展馆不是很远，走路差不多20分钟可以到了！下次如果参展还会考虑入住！但是千万不要住公寓房和套房，有水泵的声音，一整夜响好几次，根本没有办法睡好！,"We live in the business standard room. The area of the room is OK, but it is not very ventilated. There is an indescribable taste, and the sound insulation effect is very poor. Basically, we can hear the sound of calling people next door, which is very uncomfortable.There are too few things to eat breakfast, but the taste is okay.It is not far from the exhibition hall. It can be arrived for almost 20 minutes!Next time, you will consider staying!But do not live in apartment houses and suite. There is a sound of pumps. It sounds several times a night, and there is no way to sleep well!"
1,房间有点异味！是从卫生间传出来的。其余都不错。,The room is a bit odor!It was passed from the bathroom.The rest are good.
1,到株洲出差，可选的酒店也就是它了。虽然是株洲机车厂出资搞的，但是因为来往的内外宾多，总体感觉还是不错的，前台和服务员都还训练有素。,"When you go to Zhuzhou on a business trip, the optional hotel is it.Although it was invested by the Zhuzhou locomotive factory, because there were many internal and external guests, the overall feeling was still good. The front desk and waiters were well trained."
1,已经是第二次入住了，是一家性价比很高的酒店。很干净也很安静。唯一美中不足的是地理位置太偏了，周围没有商业区，不是很方便。我住时正赶上株洲下大雪，在酒店的位置很难打到出租。如果只在电力机车厂附近办事还是不错的选择。,"It is already the second time to stay, and it is a very cost -effective hotel.Very clean and quiet.The only disadvantage is that the geographical location is too biased, there is no commercial area around, it is not very convenient.When I lived, I was catching up the snow in Zhuzhou, and it was difficult to rent in the hotel's location.If you only work near the electric motorcycle factory, it is still a good choice."
1,"房间内还有前面房客的口香糖在地毯上,无睡衣位置偏其它还行,一楼餐厅还好.",There is also the gum in front of the room on the carpet. The position of no pajamas is okay. The restaurant on the first floor is okay.
1,"以住宿来说,是一个不错的选择,不过餐饮选择不多。地点不好找,也比较偏,自己开车会方便点。整体来说是一个可以的选择。(NA)","In terms of accommodation, it is a good choice, but there are not many catering choices.The location is not easy to find, and it is relatively biased. It will be convenient to drive by yourself.Overall is an available choice.(NA)"
1,房间还可以（我住的是二十一层），但空调不太好--温度不好调节以及噪音不小，淋浴水量也不是很大。另外就是酒店电梯太少了，只有两部可以用。每次都要等好长时间才能等到电梯。下次估计不会再住了,"The room is okay (I live in the twenty-one floor), but the air conditioner is not good-the temperature is not easy to adjust and the noise is not small, and the amount of shower water is not very large.The other is that there are too few hotel elevators, only two can be used.You have to wait for a long time to wait for the elevator.I will not live again next time"
1,第一次到香水湾还是07年11月份的事。那时我们单位在那开年会暨客户答谢会。客房温馨、会议室大方舒适、环境优雅，总之感觉很好。08年3月份一个阳光明媚的周末，约上同事（也是邻居）两家人去香水湾酒店度假。通过携程订了两间高级海景房。说实话，去年来香水湾时，忙着会议服务，没有闲暇及心情体验酒店。早餐后我与同事及家人驱车从海口出发。约11点多到达香水湾度假酒店。到酒店大堂行李生和前台极其热情。问是否有预定、提行李等。电瓶车送到离大堂斜对面三栋别墅的“香水苑”。行李生帮开房门后，进入房间有种清凉的感觉，我问是否开空调了。答曰：没有，因酒店地处独特的地理优势背山面海、空气流通通畅，所以房间里的温度比室外低的原因。哦！原来如此好地方。顿生有在这买房的想法。安顿下来后，到餐厅用餐。餐厅外围环境非常漂亮，建造在湖面上，可边用餐边垂钓，很独特。值得一提的是餐厅的特色菜，我们品尝了“陵水四大名菜”决了。因餐厅是开放式的，虽是自然风但有点点热，总体不错。香水湾酒店风景的确名不虚传。依山面海、主体建在湖上、高尔夫球场的那几颗树干倾斜枝叶向上延伸的棕榈树，让人想象《侏罗纪》的场景。据说是酒店的私家沙滩是难得一见的，海域宽广且幽蓝，可远眺至分界洲岛，顿感心旷神怡。听说晚上还有“黎苗篝火晚会”。晚饭后，我们两家人决定到沙滩举行“沙滩捉蟹”比赛。呵呵收获颇丰。服务员还推荐明天上午去登“吊罗山的支脉牛岭”。回到单位上班我们还津津乐道的谈及此次度假。不虚此行。我爱旅游。,"The first time I arrived in Perfume Bay was still in November 2007.At that time, our unit opened the annual meeting and customer thanksgiving meeting.The rooms are warm, the conference room is generous and comfortable, and the environment is elegant. In short, it feels good.In a sunny weekend in March 2008, two colleagues (also neighbors) went to the Perorous Bay Hotel for vacation.Two high -end seascape rooms were ordered through Ctrip.To be honest, when I came to Perfume Bay last year, I was busy with the meeting service without leisure and mood to experience the hotel.After breakfast, I drove from Haikou with my colleagues and family members after breakfast.At about 11 o'clock, you reach the Perforce Bay Resort Hotel.The luggage and front desk of the hotel lobby are extremely enthusiastic.Ask if there are reservations, luggage, etc.The battery car is sent to the ""Perfume Garden"" of the three villas opposite the lobby.After the luggage helped to open the door, I felt a cool feeling when I entered the room. I asked if I turned on the air conditioner.Answer: No, because the hotel is located in a unique geographical advantage, the air flows and the air flow is smooth, so the temperature in the room is lower than outdoors.oh!It turns out so good.Don Sheng has the idea of buying a house here.After settlement, go to the restaurant to dine.The peripheral environment of the restaurant is very beautiful. It is built on the lake and fishing while eating. It is unique.It is worth mentioning that the special dishes of the restaurant, we tasted the decision of ""Four Famous Dises in Lingshui"".Because the restaurant is open, although it is natural, it is a bit hot, and it is generally good.The landscape of the Perfume Bay Hotel is true.The palm trees that extend the branches and leaves that are built on the lake and the golf course are extended upwards, which makes people imagine the scene of ""Jurassic"".It is said that the private sandy beach of the hotel is rare. The waters are wide and blue, but they can overlook to the Jiezhou Island.I heard that there was ""Li Miao Bonfire Party"" at night.After dinner, the two of us decided to go to the beach to hold a ""beach to catch crabs"" competition.Hehe is quite harvest.The waiter also recommends to go to the ""Zhimai Niuling of the Dangluo Mountain"" tomorrow morning.Back to the unit to work, we also talked about this vacation.This trip.I love travel."
1,入住木棉花就是因为听说它环境不错，如果的结果还是比较满意的！不过这个价格在无锡真的不算有什么竞争力！如果赋予他更大的竞争力，那我想木棉花将会是我来无锡首选的酒店！另外房间的设施挺齐全的，我当时定的是一楼的房间，前台特意为我推荐一间，入住后却是感觉不错，房间环境也好，视野也开阔！还要值得说的是楼下的服务员，大热天还特意跑出去为我们叫车，真的让我和我女友很感动，希望酒店也能为他们考虑一下，改善一下他们的工作环境！宾馆反馈2008年8月14日：非常感谢您对我们酒店和工作的支持与认可，您的满意就是我们最大的心愿，酒店全体员工共同期待您的下次光临！！！！,"Staying in kapok is because I heard that its environment is good, if the result is still satisfactory!But this price is really not competitive in Wuxi!If I give him greater competitiveness, then I think kapok will be the preferred hotel in Wuxi!In addition, the room's facilities are quite complete. At that time, I set a room on the first floor. The front desk specially recommended me a room for me. After staying, it felt good, the room environment was good, and the vision was wide!It is worth talking about the waiter downstairs. The hot day also ran out to call us a car. It really touched my girlfriend. I hope the hotel can also think about them and improve their working environment!Hotel feedback on August 14, 2008: Thank you very much for your support and recognition of our hotels and work. Your satisfaction is our greatest wish. All employees of the hotel are looking forward to your next visit!IntersectionIntersectionIntersection"
1,"昨天刚从木棉花回来，比预期的还要好一些，总结如下：1装修风格简单＋现代，大小并不局促，洗浴小样比较Q,有浴室拖鞋和浴室电话这点比较赞，建议酒店参照一下香港的一些酒店，可以做成不同装修风格的满足不同客户的需求，比如绿色系列，米色系列，morden但也绝不昂贵。2酒店服务下午1点半到，没有午饭吃，这点有所欠缺，客户人员很nice，虽然有些看上去还是新手，表扬门口为我们拦车的门童，天很热，人很勤快。另，它的商务中心可以借书借碟借玩具，底楼的bar没什么人，但还不错，下次去要打台球＝）3酒店餐点中等吧，早餐并不丰富，但是足已，午餐，我觉得是偏贵的，而且没啥点菜欲望。宾馆反馈2008年6月14日：非常感谢阁下对本酒店的支持及建议，目前酒店新增了一些东北菜式，希望下次您能有机会来我们酒店品尝。同时酒店四楼新增了视听、阅读休息廊，希望能在你工作之余带来心情的放松。另有关色系方面我们酒店靠近豪华房的走道窗户边想做些装饰或调整，目前只有五楼作了些改造，三楼、四楼、六楼、七楼目前正在思考中，欢迎您能多给我们提点建议，一经采纳，将会获得我们的提供的神秘礼物哦，我们的家园希望能与您共建！呵呵，再次感谢您的支持，期待您的下次光临。","Yesterday, I just came back from kapok, which is better than expected. The summary is as follows: 1 The decoration style is simple + modern, the size is not cramped, the bathroom slippers and the bathroom phone are compared. It is recommended that the hotel refer to Hong KongSome hotels can be made into different decoration styles to meet the needs of different customers, such as the green series, the beige series, but Morden is not expensive.2 The hotel service arrives at 1:30 pm. There is no lunch. This is lacking. The customer staff is very nice. Although some still seem to be a novice, they praise the door of the door for us.In addition, its business center can borrow books and borrow toys. There is no one in BAR in the bottom floor, but it is not bad. I want to play billiards next time.I think it is too expensive, and there is no desire to cook.Hotel feedback on June 14, 2008: Thank you very much for your support and suggestions for the hotel. At present, some new Northeast dishes have been added in the hotel. I hope that next time you can have the opportunity to come to our hotel to taste.At the same time, the audiovisual and reading lounges are added on the fourth floor of the hotel, hoping to bring your mood relaxation after your work.In addition, in terms of color system, our hotel is near the aisle window of the luxury room and wants to make some decoration or adjustment. At present, only the fifth floor has been made.Give us some suggestions. Once adopted, we will get the mysterious gifts we provide. Our home hopes to work with you!Hehe, thank you again for your support and look forward to your next visit."
1,酒店位置很好，就在市中心广场边上，出行非常方便，房间条件也不错，下次应该还会入住。,"The hotel location is very good, just on the side of the city center, travel is very convenient, and the room conditions are also good. You should still stay next time."
1,相当好的酒店，很意外在山西能有这种水准的4星酒店，基本完美，没想出有什么不好的地方，住了2天，很满意！,"The pretty good hotel, surprised to have this level of 4 -star hotels in Shanxi, which is basically perfect. I didn't think of any bad places. I lived for 2 days and was very satisfied!"
1,"我每个月都要到大同出差,第一次入住这个酒店,感觉还不错.在山西省算是不错的.具体:1.房间有卫生间下水的味道,不是很严重,可是鼻子比较灵的人能闻的到.2.餐厅及客房的服务员是非常不错的,很细心.3.前台服务员的交接不完善,我打电话和前台服务员沟通好延退到两点,大堂副理也同意了,可是忘记和别的服务员交代了,结帐时还打了半天的账单,我说了之后又找人问的,才给我结了帐,结账十分钟,都在接电话,不知道在聊什么.","I have to go to Datong on a business trip every month, and I feel pretty good for the first time. It feels good in Shanxi Province. Specifically: 1. The room has the taste of a bathroom in the room.The waiter in the restaurant and the guest rooms is very good, very careful .3. The handover of the front desk waiter is not perfect. I call to communicate with the front platform.I forgot to explain to other waiters. I also made a half -day bill at the checkout. After I said it, I asked someone to ask, and I gave me the account. I was at the checkout for ten minutes. I was answering the phone. I didn't know what was talking about."
1,人性化服商中心忙找的包品极好,The bags that are busy found by the Humanized Service Center are very good
1,虽然大同的市容不敢恭维，但是花园饭店的服务和设施还是不错的，基本上在内地二线、三线城市中算得上较高水平了。早餐很好，名不虚传。,"Although Datong's city is afraid to compliment, the services and facilities of the garden hotel are still good, basically a high level in the second and third -tier cities in the Mainland.Breakfast is very good, and the reputation is vivid."
1,我是端午节去的，价格合理，环境不错，酒店比较新，房间也比较大，只是空调有所欠缺，老是打不足。餐厅环境可以，菜的味道也不错，特别是有一个厨师烧的螺丝，味道特别好，我们吃完又加点了一份，大家争着吃。湿地是一个空气新鲜、环境安静，适合休闲度假的好去处。有空值得晃晃，交通也比较方便。,"I went to the Dragon Boat Festival. The price was reasonable, the environment was good, the hotel was relatively new, and the room was relatively large. However, the air conditioner was lacking, and I was always inadequate.The restaurant environment is okay, and the taste of the dishes is also good, especially with a screw of a chef burned. The taste is particularly good. We add an order after eating, and everyone compete for food.Wetland is a good place for fresh air, quiet environment, suitable for leisure vacation.It is worth shaking, and transportation is more convenient."
1,"没想到在那个地方还藏着个五星酒店,我还以为旁边的美隆就算最好的了.住的是促销的398房间,还是比较划算的.下次还住.唯一遗憾的是房间内稍微简单了点.不过discountedprice,cuttingcornersisacceptable,LOL","I did not expect that there was a five -star hotel hiding in that place. I thought that Miron next to it was the best. I lived in the 398 room of the promotion, and it was more cost -effective. I still live next time.It's a bit simple."
1,在香港一直住粤海酒店，听说上海粤海酒店是一家五星级的酒店，所以这次来上海就想到来住一下上海的粤海酒店，通过携程网搜索到价格，感觉价格挺适中。一进酒店，大堂宽敞明亮，感觉很舒服。我住的是一间高级大床房，房间很现代，挺不错，性价比挺高，交通也很方便。下次朋友如果来上海我也会推荐住粤海。,"I have been living in the Yuehai Hotel in Hong Kong. I heard that Shanghai Yuehai Hotel is a five -star hotel. Therefore, this time I came to Shanghai to stay in Shanghai's Yuehai Hotel and searched the price through Ctrip.com. I feel that the price is quite moderate.As soon as I entered the hotel, the lobby was spacious and bright.I live in a high -end bedroom. The room is very modern, very good, the price is very high, and the transportation is very convenient.Next time, if friends come to Shanghai, I will recommend living in Guangdong."
1,"正好到宝钢出差,朋友推荐入住粤海酒店,酒店整体不错,听说已开张3年多,但看上去蛮新的。大堂很气派，还是坐式服务，坐一会感觉还真不错。我住的是高级大床房，房间蛮大的，床也蛮大的，很舒服。浴室和卧室是由玻璃隔开的，很新鲜，总的感觉很不错。下次来基本还会住粤海酒店。","It happened to be a business trip in Baosteel. Friends recommend staying at the Yuehai Hotel. The hotel is good as a whole. I heard that it has been opened for more than 3 years, but it looks pretty new.The lobby is very elegant, but I still feel good for a while.I live in a high -end big bed room. The room is quite large, the bed is quite large, and it is very comfortable.The bathroom and the bedroom are separated by glass. It is fresh and feels very good.Next time, I will basically stay in Yuehai Hotel."
1,不错的酒店，性价比很好。房间主题命令华丽。去香港也是住的粤海酒店。补充点评2008年4月12日：打错字了，是明亮华丽。洗嗽用户和不错。,"Good hotel, the cost -effective is very good.The theme of the room was ordered to be gorgeous.Going to Hong Kong is also the Yuehai Hotel.Supplementary comment on April 12, 2008: The wrong word is made, it is bright and gorgeous.Cough users and good."
1,房间比较小，但非常温馨，设施全面，房间上网需要收费，但在楼道里有免费上网电脑。,"The room is relatively small, but it is very warm. The facilities are comprehensive. The room needs to be charged on the Internet, but there are free Internet computers in the corridor."
1,如果小不是问题，如果你能接受房价比较压抑，那么曼哈顿真是不错的选择。。。,"If small is not a problem, if you can accept house prices more depressed, Manhattan is really a good choice.EssenceEssence"
1,酒店不错，餐厅东西挺好吃的。交通也很方便，附近还有广场和大商场,"The hotel is good, and the restaurant is very delicious.Transportation is also very convenient, there are also squares and large shopping malls nearby"
1,"非常喜欢夜上海的美景,尤其是流光十色的外滩夜景!上海曼哈顿商务酒店具外滩只有数百米,哈哈,真是意想不到的一转身就能饱览全上海最美的地方,一回头就能融入最繁华的南京路!","I like the beauty of night Shanghai very much, especially the luminous bund night view! Shanghai Manhattan business hotel has only hundreds of meters. Haha, it is really an unexpected turn to enjoy the most beautiful places in Shanghai.The most prosperous Nanjing Road!"
1,"非常不错的一个酒店,离北京后海酒吧一条街很近,就在平安大街的旁边,很好找,房间很干净舒适,环境也不错,唯一不足的是服务员水平一般,素质不高.不过还是可以住的","A very nice hotel, very close to the streets of Beijing Houhai Bar, just next to Ping An Street, it is easy to find, the room is very clean and comfortable, and the environment is also good.living"
1,"地理位置不错,自己开车去还是很方便的,房间幽雅舒适,非常干净!价格也比较合理,比我住的3星的酒店还好!我介绍朋友去住了10几天他们也非常满意!下","The geographical location is good. It is very convenient to drive by the car. The room is elegant and comfortable, very clean! The price is more reasonable, better than the 3 -star hotel I live in! I introduced my friends for more than 10 days and they are very satisfied! Next"
1,前台接待服务素质需要提高，登记时等待时间较长，房间还行，,"The quality of the front desk reception service needs to be improved, the waiting time is long, and the room is okay."
1,挺不错的一家酒店，地段也好。入住的是31层的行政楼层，房内的设施比较好，特别是卫生间内设置得很有条理，透过淋浴房的大玻璃可以看到卧室内的电视，所有的洗漱用品都放在一个精致的小盒子里，马桶还配置了自动冲洗装置。特别喜欢为入住客人准备的很厚很软的大拖鞋，作为一次性使用的拖鞋感到太可惜了。酒店为行政层设置了单独的早餐厅，环境很好，只是感到品种太少了些，早餐质量也有待提高，不知道是不是因为新政层每天用早餐的人不是很多。以后到南京还会考虑入住的。,"A good hotel and the location.The administrative floor of the 31st floor is in the room. The facilities in the room are better, especially in the bathroom. You can see the TV in the bedroom through the large glass of the shower room. All toiletries are placed on a delicateIn the small box, the toilet is also equipped with an automatic rinse device.I especially like to prepare a very thick and soft slippers for the guests who stay in the guests. It is a pity that it is a one -time slippers.The hotel has a separate breakfast room for the administrative layer. The environment is very good, but I feel that there are too few varieties, and the quality of breakfast needs to be improved. I do n’t know if there are not many people who have breakfast every day in the new policy.I will consider staying in Nanjing in the future."
1,再次入住，感觉行政楼层的房间要比其他楼层的好不少，但早餐要比2楼的品种少不少。只要不再涨价，下次还会考虑入住。,"Checking in again, I feel that the room on the administrative floor is much better than other floors, but breakfast is much less than the second floor.As long as the price is no longer increased, you will consider check -in next time."
1,这家酒店不错，入住的30楼，可以直接看到玄武湖，风景不错，房里的飘窗做得有特色，喜欢！床也很软，有台电脑可以上网，比较方便。房间也挺大的，用具不错，放在一个小盒子里，感觉很好。离中心比较近，去哪里都蛮方便的。顺便说下狮子桥里的回味，鸭血粉丝汤很不错，值得一试，比夫子庙那家好太多了。去了二天基本没吃好一顿饭，发现南京的盐是不是不要钱，菜巨咸无比，连KFC都要咸很多！-_-！！,"This hotel is good. On the 30th floor of staying, you can directly see Xuanwu Lake. The scenery is good. The bay windows in the room are distinctive. I like it!The bed is also very soft. It is more convenient to have a computer.The room is also very large, and the utensils are good. It feels good in a small box.It's closer to the center, it's pretty convenient to go wherever you go.By the way, the aftertaste in the Lion Bridge, the duck blood fan soup is very good, it is worth trying, it is much better than the family.I did n’t eat a meal for two days. I found that the salt in Nanjing does not need money. The vegetables are extremely salty, and even KFC is much salty!-_-!Intersection"
1,该酒店地理位置不错，离浦东机场不远，主要是周围环境还不错，而且干净，酒店服务就更没得说了，非常到位！,"The hotel has a good geographical location, not far from Pudong Airport, mainly because the surrounding environment is not bad, and the hotel services are not even more unbelievable. It is very in place!"
1,"此次我在雅客滨江住了13个晚上，订的是城市景观房的高层。以下是我的感受：一，在上海这是一家性价比非常高的酒店。房间布置简洁舒适，卫生间也很大，最令人开心的是有阳台。二,厨房设备齐全，冰箱很大，厨具餐具也比较全，对于家庭旅行来说是非常实用的选择。三，服务很好，尤其是整理房间的工作人员，尽职尽责；认真热情。四，交通有些不方便，但是附近有公交车的终点站，如果外地的朋友能仔细研究一下上海交通旅游图的话，会发现就附近的公交车站和地铁站就完全可以满足你出行的需要了。总的来说我们这次入住这家酒店还是很满意的！！！","This time I lived in Ya Ke Binjiang for 13 nights, and I ordered the high -rise of urban landscape houses.The following is my feelings: First, this is a very cost -effective hotel in Shanghai.The room layout is simple and comfortable, the bathroom is also very large, the most happy is the balcony.Second, the kitchen equipment is complete, the refrigerator is very large, and the kitchenware and tableware are relatively complete. It is a very practical choice for family travel.Third, the service is very good, especially the staff who sort out the room to do their duties; serious and enthusiasm.Fourth, transportation is a bit inconvenient, but there is a bus terminal nearby. If friends from other places can carefully study the Shanghai traffic travel map, you will find that the nearby bus stations and subway stations can fully meet the needs of your travel.EssenceIn general, we are still very satisfied with this hotel this hotel!IntersectionIntersection"
1,399真的很值得之前也住过别的差不多价位的酒店式公寓没有这间好厨房很像厨房很大整个格局也都很舒服早上的早餐我订的8点半的已经冷了。。。位置啊什么还是很好的下次还会去服务也很周到,"399 really worthy of living in a hotel -style apartment that has also lived in different prices before. This good kitchen is like a large kitchen. The whole pattern is very comfortable. The morning breakfast I booked is 8:30.EssenceEssenceThe location is still good, the service will be very thoughtful next time"
1,订的是高层的城市景观大床房，房间的装修很喜欢，有很多窗户，洗手间也很宽敞，卫生条件不错，床也很舒服，还有水果和早餐送到房间，早餐虽然简单，口味却还不错。不过门口在修路，打车有点不方便，办理退房手续有点慢，得提前一点。总体来说，还是性价比很高的酒店，下次还会去住,"The high -rise urban landscape bed room is booked. The decoration of the room is very favorite. There are many windows, the toilet is also spacious, the sanitary conditions are good, and the bed is very comfortable. There are fruits and breakfast to the room.not bad.However, the road is building the road. It is a bit inconvenient to take a taxi. It is a bit slow to go through check -out procedures.Overall, it is still a very cost -effective hotel, and I will stay next time"
1,除了水忽冷忽热，其他都可以，安静，交通方便，周围吃饭也好，下次还会继续住他。楼下有公共车直达火车站和冰雪大世界，机场大巴到康安路站后也离这个酒店很近,"Except for the cold and cold water, everything else can be, quiet, convenient transportation, or eating around, and will continue to live in him next time.Downstairs is a public vehicle directly to the railway station and the ice and snow world. After the airport bus arrives at the Kang'an Road Station, it is very close to this hotel."
1,住过两次了，第一次是出差，第二次是自己去玩。周边比较热闹，虽然不是吃饭购物最理想的地方，好在交通方便。房间宽敞干净，服务态度和效率也是蛮好的。在300-400元的价格段里，自感是携程协议酒店中性价比最好的一个。交通方面，直接跟司机说安内宁夏大厦就好了，胡同口有指示，行车时仔细留神可以看到招牌。,"I have lived twice, the first time is a business trip, and the second time I go to play by myself.The surroundings are more lively. Although it is not the ideal place to eat and shop, fortunately, the transportation is convenient.The room is spacious and clean, and the service attitude and efficiency are also quite good.In the price section of 300-400 yuan, self-feel is the best cost-effective in the Ctrip Agreement Hotel.In terms of transportation, I just told the driver that the Annen Ningxia Building is fine. There are instructions for the Hutong. If you care about it, you can see the signboard carefully."
1,位置还可以，就是难找了点，在胡同里。入住手续较快，房间还不错，比较新，当然，隔音稍微差了点。总体还好。,"The position is okay, it is difficult to find some, in the hutong.The movement is fast, the room is not bad, it is relatively new, of course, the sound insulation is a bit worse.Overall."
1,由于杭州湾大桥修通，现在从上海到宁波非常方便，直接导致我心仪的这个宾馆很难定，靠携程沟通半天才订到两张双床房，所以出现一次入住两个点评。,"Due to the Hangzhou Bay Bridge, it is very convenient to from Shanghai to Ningbo, which directly leads to the difficulty of my favorite hotel. It is for a long time to communicate with Ctrip before ordering two double beds. Therefore, two comments appeared once."
1,酒店太难找一路上也没有标示问了好多人最后还是给酒店打了不少电话走了不少冤枉路才找到的不过只要去过一次下次就不会走错了酒店感觉很好比照片看上去的更漂亮房间也有意思是两层的下面是客厅上面是卧室总的来说这样的酒店这样价格是很值得的,"The hotel is too difficult to find along the way, and I did n’t marker all the way to ask many people. Finally, I made a lot of phone calls to the hotel. I found a lot of wrongdoing. I just have to go to the next time. The hotel will feel good. It ’s like a photo.The more beautiful room to go up is also interesting. Below the two floors is that the upper room is generally worth saying that the price of such a hotel is worthwhile."
1,"8月1日入住该酒店,对携程网的服务非常非常满意,安排的房间非常非常满意,住的行政海景房,房间很精致窗外的海景更是美不胜收,早餐也很丰富有一些小零食,很细心,很干净和价位相符的酒店,比海航要好多了,一点瑕疵就是打客服电话需要服务,反映过慢,","Checking into the hotel on August 1st, I am very satisfied with the service of Ctrip.com. The rooms they arranged are very very satisfied.Careful, very clean hotels that match the price are much better than HNA. A little bit of flaw is to call the customer service and the service, which is too slow."
1,三亚湾假日酒店，非常适合懒散型的自由行；酒店的泳池非常漂亮，打车去市区和机场都非常便利；这次住的是行政楼层海景房，蓝天白云真的美得不得了，还送每天洗衣、软饮和下午茶，真的不错；鱼疗池要收费，稍微有点遗憾，酒店刚开业的时候是不用的；早餐的品种和档次稍低些,"Sanya Bay Holiday Hotel is very suitable for lazy free travel; the hotel's swimming pool is very beautiful, and it is very convenient to take a taxi to the urban area and the airport.It ’s really good to wash, soft drinks and afternoon tea every day; the fish therapy pool is a bit regrettable. It is not necessary when the hotel was just opened; the breeds and grades of breakfast were slightly lower"
1,"酒店员工都很亲切随时报以笑容，但是酒店不算新了，早餐品种单一，每天都一样，晚上的自助晚餐菜品也一般，信价比不高哦，还不如打车去滨海路的餐厅吃，好吃又便宜。酒店spa,健身中心，大堂都非常的普通，游泳池也不算大，不过酒店对面就是私人海滩，可以在海滩边消磨一天，还是不错的。","Hotel employees are very kind to report at any time, but the hotel is not new. The breakfast varieties are single and the same every day. The buffet dinner dishes at night are also average.It's delicious and cheap.The hotel spa, fitness center, and lobby are very ordinary, and the swimming pool is not large, but the private beach opposite the hotel can be grinded on the beach for a day, which is still good."
1,很不错的一家酒店在三亚湾那里，价位很低，服务也不错。,A very good hotel is at Sanya Bay. The price is very low and the service is good.
1,如果不想在神仙居景点玩2天以上，那还是应该选择近市区的酒店，否则过了5点以后就要坐出租车上山喽，嘿嘿！还有就是房间内有跳蚤，被咬了好几口。不过餐厅的饭菜做的还不赖，量又多。,"If you don't want to play at the fairy attraction for more than 2 days, you should still choose a hotel near the urban area, otherwise you will take a taxi to the mountain after 5 o'clock, hehe!There are fleas in the room, and they were bitten several mouthfuls.However, the meals in the restaurant are not bad, and there are many."
1,今年年初新开的酒店，房间设施很新，感觉十分不错，性价比很高，在宝山区个人认为比宝山宾馆好很多。到宝钢办业务的人员最佳选择。,"The newly opened hotel at the beginning of this year, the room facilities are very new, it feels very good, and the cost performance is very high. I personally think that it is much better than Baoshan Hotel in Baoshan District.The best choice to go to Baosteel's business."
1,8月1日、2日住了两天，总体感觉还行，虽然设施给人简单的印象但该有的都有而且比较干净。酒店的位置还不错，从机场没有直达的公交，我乘27路到“湖滨南路东”下再打车，车资8.5+1元。交通也很方便，出酒店往右转就有公交车站（“滨南斗西路口”站），到厦大、南普陀、轮渡、中山路都有直达车。早餐的品种不多座位不多，但还说的过去。,"I lived for two days on August 1st and 2nd. The overall feeling is okay. Although the facilities give people a simple impression, they should have all and clean.The location of the hotel is not bad. There is no direct bus from the airport. I took the 27th Road to the ""East of the Hubin South Road"" and took a taxi at 8.5+1 yuan.The transportation is also very convenient. If you turn right from the hotel, there will be a bus station (the ""Binnan Douxi intersection"" station). You have direct cars to Xiamen University, Napha, Wasan, and Zhongshan Road.There are not many types of breakfast, but there are not many seats, but they also say the past."
1,酒店还算干净，送早餐，就是酒店名字容易让人误解，周围没有湖，感觉还可以。,"The hotel is quite clean. Sending breakfast is that the hotel name is easy to misunderstand. There is no lake around, and it feels okay."
1,还可以，离汽车站也很近。离轮渡也很近，也比较干净。起先我预定了厦门元利酒店，结果上网还有时间限制就取消了，预定银河商务酒店，靠，服务垃圾极点，房间象招待所，比起恰年两家，着家才算是个酒店，不错，强烈推荐,"Okay, it is very close to the bus station.It is also very close to the ferry, and it is relatively clean.At first I booked Xiamen Yuanli Hotel. As a result, there was a time limit on the Internet. The Galaxy Business Hotel was scheduled.recommend"
1,这次是第二次住了，感觉属于干净、卫生、简单、便宜的那种。2年过去有了简单的“升级”，呵呵。就是卫生间改用马桶了~,"This time I lived for the second time, and I felt a clean, hygienic, simple, and cheap one.Two years have passed with a simple ""upgrade"", haha.It is the toilet in the bathroom ~"
1,"到缙云也没别的地方好住,在这里住了个套房,感觉还可以,在一个小县城里有这样的地方就算不错了.房间是设备尚可,玻璃是两层的,主要是因为靠近火车站的缘故,而火车汽笛声音又很有穿透力.以后来,还必须住这里.","There is no other place to live in Yunyun. I lived in a suite here. It feels okay. There is such a place in a small county.Because of the railway station, the sound of the train whistle is very penetrating. In the future, you must live here."
1,"交通很便利,到渔人码头和港澳码头都在步行的范围之内.CHECKIN和CHECKOUT的速度都很快,房间属于狭长型的,还算蛮大的,尤其喜欢那个宽敞的卫生间~~~",The transportation is very convenient. Both the Fisherman's Wharf and the Hong Kong and Macau Wharf are walking within the scope of walking. Checkin and Checkout are very fast. The rooms are narrow and quite large. I especially like the spacious bathroom ~~~
1,"房间还是不错的.至少在酒店式公寓里算是好的.前台不是很热情,毕竟是酒店式公寓,不是酒店,所受培训不是很够.酒店的ShuttleBus很方便,司机师傅也很热情,很好.推荐入住.","The room is still good. At least in the hotel -style apartment is good. The front desk is not very enthusiastic. After all, it is a hotel -style apartment, not a hotel, and the training is not enough. The hotel of the hotel is very convenient.. Recommended check -in."
1,上海浦东雅诗阁，宽带是要额外收费的，然而在携程的网站上（，房间价格的表格中，宽带下面只是写着“宽带”两个字，后来在酒店结账的时候发现宽带是额外收费的，我给携程打电话，才被告知，“宽带”这两个字仅仅表明这个酒店有宽带设施！其实在我使用宽带之前，已经和前台询问是否收费，前台当时可能忙，说让我先用，结帐的时候免去。结果结账的时候是另一个服务生，拒绝免除宽带费。让我向携程讨公道去。知道我把他们的大堂副经理叫了出来，我的外国同事用英语把这个经理数落了一番之后，他们才免除了这笔费用。其实上网费并不多，几百元钱，但是这种出尔反尔，先告诉我免费，再收费的做法实在是过分。而且，对中国人和外国人的态度明显不一样，也让我感到很不爽。,"Shanghai Pudong Estee Pavilion, broadband is extra charges. However, on Ctrip's website (in the form of room price, the word ""broadband"" is only written under the broadband. LaterWell, I called Ctrip and was told that the word ""broadband"" only indicated that the hotel had broadband facilities! In fact, before I used the broadband, I asked the front desk whether to charge the charge.Use, free at checkout. When the result of checkout is another waiter, refuses to exempt from broadband fees. Let me ask Ctrip to ask for a door. I know that I call their lobby deputy manager out. My foreign colleagues use English in English.After counting this manager, they would be exempted from this fee. In fact, there are not many online fees, hundreds of dollars, but this kind of outspoken, first tell me for free, and then the method of charging is too much. Moreover, right, right?The attitude of Chinese and foreigners is obviously different, and it makes me feel very upset."
1,服务态度基本可以，就是房间内蚊子比较多，而且被子比较薄，晚上睡觉有点冷！,"The service attitude is basically possible, that is, there are more mosquitoes in the room, and the quilt is thinner, and sleeping at night is a bit cold!"
1,我是第一次入住香格里拉，现在距当时入住有一个月了，除了前台的微笑，没有什么更多印象了。。。,"I was in Shangri -La for the first time, and now I have been staying at the time for a month. There is no more impression except the smile on the front desk.EssenceEssence"
1,当地最好的酒店。房间条件很好，我住拐角的房间，布局比较特殊。总体来说满意。,The best local hotel.The room conditions are very good. I live in the corner room and have a special layout.Overall satisfied.
1,很好的酒店，就是不知道为什么一直在涨价，价格越来越离谱，在常州属于极贵的酒店了。是不是携程和香格里拉的关系不够铁呢？希望价格能更合情理一些。,"A good hotel is that I don't know why the price has been raising, the price is becoming more and more outrageous, and it is a very expensive hotel in Changzhou.Is the relationship between Ctrip and Shangri -La?I hope the price can be more reasonable."
1,房间非常大，卫生间也不错，入住很舒适。有个温水游泳池，免费的，不过要记住带泳帽去，当场买一个，很贵的。,"The room is very large, the bathroom is also good, and it is comfortable to stay in.There is a warm water swimming pool, free, but remember to bring a swimming hat, buy one on the spot, it is very expensive."
1,从机场到酒店大约25分钟，37元左右。酒店环境还不错，因为以前住过的原因感觉很亲切。离傅家庄公园非常近，早上去的时候正好赶上涨潮，捡了好多海带回来，味道还真是不错。建议打车到燕窝岭再徒步到老虎滩沿途风光非常美！酒店可以卖到优惠的景点门票。,"About 25 minutes from the airport to the hotel, about 37 yuan.The hotel's environment is not bad, because I have lived before it feels very kind.It is very close to Fujiazhuang Park. When I went in the morning, I just caught up with the tide. I picked up a lot of sea and brought it back. The taste was really good.It is recommended to take a taxi to the Bird's Nest Ridge and then walk to the tiger beach. The scenery along the way is very beautiful!Hotels can sell discounts for attractions."
1,第一次入住，感觉酒店很华丽，房间也还不错。不过枕头太多了，不知道放那么多是干什么用的。服务感觉一般，我退房的时候，办完手续服务员连客套话都没有就忙别的去了，也没人来帮我拿行李，可能是因为看我是中国人的关系吧(旁边很多外国人)。然后拿着行李去打车，门童也不热情。这个和酒店水准有点差别。另外我忘了一件狠新的短袖衬衣在房间，酒店也没有主动和我联系。后来就不了了之了。下次自己的话，可能不会入住了。感觉不如选择其他同等酒店。,"For the first time, I felt the hotel was gorgeous and the room was pretty good.However, there are too many pillows. I don't know what to do so.The service feels average. When I check out, I will go after the procedures do not even have a guest talk. No one will help me get my luggage. It may be because I am a Chinese relationship (there are many foreign countries next to it.people).Then take the luggage to take a taxi, and the door children are not enthusiastic.This is a bit different from the hotel level.In addition, I forgot a new short -sleeved shirt in the room, and the hotel did not take the initiative to contact me.Later, it was gone.I may not stay in my words next time.It feels better to choose other restaurants."
1,不错不错的比喜来登还好的下次还会住支持,"Not bad, better than Xilain, I will live support next time"
1,我是7月9号晚10点多的时候入住的，房间很新，据说是跟格林豪泰是同一公司的，可能是是新开业的，酒店管理不是很规范，员工早早的都下班了，给我房间换床单被套的居然是保安，不过前台跟保安的态度都很好，位置很不错，楼下就是汉中路地铁站，太平洋百货走5分钟就可以到，值得一住！另：协程的服务乱78糟的，本来订南站的酒店因为长途汽车临时变道，致电协程要求订一个靠近新客站北广场的宾馆结果居然给我定到南广场去了，而且还是在一小区里，后面自己找到了这个酒店要求他们帮我定结果跟我说没有，最后反倒是我自己问的前台，才给开了房间，协程给的价格没有任何的折扣跟前台给的是一样的！,"I stayed at more than 10 pm on July 9th. The room was very new. It is said that it was the same company as Green Haotai. It may be newly opened. Hotel management is not very standardized. Employees have been out of work early.It is a security guard who changed the bed sheets to me in the room, but the front desk and the security guard have a good attitude. The location is very good. The downstairs is the Hanzhong Road Metro Station. Pacific Department Store can arrive in 5 minutes. It is worth living!Another: The service of the coroutine is 78. The hotel originally booked the South Railway Station was temporarily changed because of the long -distance bus.In a community, I found this hotel and asked them to help me tell me. In the end, I asked the front desk myself before I opened the room.it's the same!"
1,"离地铁站真的很近,4号出口对过就是,服务上还欠妥不够主动,其他还行,和价格比较符合.",It is really close to the subway station. The export of No. 4 is that the service is not enough to take the initiative. Others are okay.
1,"酒点店的大堂和内部非常别致,如户外休闲的感觉,价格在全国范围内还可以,但略高于同级城市,服务还需在提高,总体印象基本还不错.","The lobby and interior of the wine shop are very chic. For example, the feeling of outdoor leisure, the price is okay nationwide, but it is slightly higher than the same cities, the service needs to be improved, and the overall impression is basically good."
1,"火车的声音没有想象中的大,下次去还会考虑住这里","The sound of the train is not as big as expected, and I will consider living here next time"
1,从未去过深圳，通过携程看红桂酒店不错。感觉是大堂很气派，象个4星，服务也不错。房间（我订的标准间）是小了一点。我很满意！,"I have never been to Shenzhen, and it is good to see Honggui Hotel through Ctrip.It feels like the lobby is very elegant, like a 4 star, and the service is good.The room (the standard room I booked) is a little smaller.I am very satisfied!"
1,我订的是430元的房间，宽敞舒服，也没有一般酒店的气味，环境很不错。还有迎宾果篮，2盒酸奶+2包炭烧咖啡+1包薯片，如果能换成饼干，可能作为第二天的早餐更实用些。洗手间的配置也比较齐全，干净。我最喜欢的是床垫不是太软，结实，睡得很舒服。唯一不足的，就是床单有些脏，看上去还是血迹，虽然不是太大的痕迹，但第二天早上发现时，心理还是有些不太舒服。希望布草房的同事还要努力了！宾馆反馈2008年6月23日：首先谢谢您能选择本酒店入住并能给我们的服务予以肯定.我们将针对您提出的宝贵意见进行改进.期待在您的下次光临之时能为您提供更优质的服务.点,"I booked a room of 430 yuan, which is spacious and comfortable, and there is no smell of ordinary hotels. The environment is very good.There are also welcome fruit baskets, 2 boxes of yogurt+2 packs of charcoal coffee+1 bag of potato chips. If you can replace it with biscuits, it may be more practical for breakfast for the next day.The configuration of the toilet is relatively complete and clean.My favorite is that the mattress is not too soft, strong, and sleepy comfortably.The only shortcoming is that the sheets are a little dirty, and it looks still blood. Although it is not too much traces, when discovered the next morning, the psychology is still a bit uncomfortable.I hope the colleagues in the Cao Cao will work hard!Hotel feedback on June 23, 2008: First of all, thank you for choosing your hotel to stay and affirmed our services. We will improve the valuable opinions you put forward. We look forward to providing you with your next visit to provide you with your next visit.High -quality service. Point"
1,酒店比较新，设施齐全，交通方便。还是有点贵。补充点评2007年12月25日：好在有公司付账，感觉房间够大，交通方便。,"The hotel is relatively new, the facilities are complete, and the transportation is convenient.Still a bit expensive.Supplementary comment on December 25, 2007: Fortunately, there is a company to pay, and the room feels large enough and convenient transportation."
1,酒店环境还可以，服务也很好，就是房间的卫生稍稍马虎了一些，坐便器擦得不是十分干净，其它方面都还好。尤其是早餐，在我住过的四星酒店里算是花样比较多的了。因为游泳池是在室外，所以这个季节去了怕冷的人就没有办法游泳。补充点评2007年11月16日：服务方面忘了说一点，因为我落了一样小东西在酒店，还以为就算了，没想到昨天离开，今天就收到邮件提醒我说我落了东西，问我需要不需要他们给寄回来，这一点比有些酒店要好很多。,"The hotel environment is okay, and the service is also very good, that is, the hygiene of the room is a little bit more sloppy. The toilet is not very clean, and it is okay in other aspects.Especially for breakfast, there are more tricks in the four -star hotel I have lived.Because the swimming pool is outdoors, people who are afraid of cold this season cannot swim.Supplementary comment on November 16, 2007: I forgot to say a little about the service, because I have a small thing in the hotel. I thought even if I left yesterday. I received an email today to remind me that I had something to do, and asked me.Do I need to send them back, which is much better than some hotels."
1,"作为喜达屋的金卡会员,喜来登就是品质的保证,所以好的不多说了,鸡蛋里挑骨头说点需要改进的吧.1.房门自动关不紧,要拉一下,有点危险.2.前两次入住一早会把帐单从门缝里塞进来,感觉很细致,这次却没有,可能是入住人太多了忙不过来.3.中午吃的自助餐,海蟹肯定不太新鲜,要重视啊!4.最不爽的是：这一年价钱涨得太快了！另外，这次入住的是高级大床房，感觉反而没有舒适大床房好。个人觉得喜达屋旗下的酒店各有千秋，象艾美是奢华和大气，豪达喜来登是复古和庄重，福朋的特色则应该是精巧雅致，房间一大反而失去了那种紧凑感。（所以楼下有人评福朋的房间小应该就是指的舒适房，但岂不知这才是她的特色。）还有携程的信息可能有点问题，舒适大床房中的大床可能是queensize的，高级大床房的大床可能是kingsize，两者不仅是房间面积的不同，有机会应该核证一下。","As a member of the Kiddart's golden card, Xilaiden is the guarantee of quality, so it ’s not much to say. Picking bones in the eggs need to be improved. 1. The door is automatically closed. It’ s a bit dangerous .2.I will stuff the bill from the door cracks early in the morning, I feel very detailed, but this time there is no, it may be that there are too many people who can’t be busy .3. The buffets who eat at noon, sea crabs must not be fresh.We must pay attention to it! 4. The most uncomfortable is: the price of this year has risen too fast!In addition, this time I stayed in a high -end large bed, but I felt that there was no comfortable large bed room.Personally, I think that the hotels of Starwood have their own advantages. Emmy is luxurious and atmospheric. Hawadori is retro and solemn. The characteristics of Fupeng should be delicate and elegant. Instead, the room has lost that kind of compactness.(So some people downstairs commented that the room of Fu Peng should be a comfortable room, but do you not know that this is her characteristic.) And Ctrip's information may be a bit problematic, the large bed in the comfortable large bed may be queensizeThe large bed in the high -end bedroom may be kingsize. The two are not only different in the room area. If you have the opportunity, you should take a proof."
1,"今年厦洽会期间,我们入住该酒店,该酒店的服务水平总体不错,尤其是所处的环境非常的好,特别适合外地来人的参加会议住宿,交通便利,是一家不错的酒店.","During the Xiamen Fair this year, we stayed in the hotel.

1,"本来订的湖景标房,到了那问我要不要大床房,反正偶就一个人.进去之后觉得大得有点空旷,电视机离最近的床沿当中有3米.显得电视机小了很多.感觉还行.就是大堂有点土气.樱花酒吧就不要去了.环境真的是闹中取静,隔壁是个蛮大的夜总会,不过除此之外,在15分钟步行范围内,没有什么商业设施,晚上走在路上觉得空旷渺无人烟,当然花花草草还是很多的,是有个湖,不过湖景么....","The lake viewing room I originally booked at the time of asked me if I want a big bed room, anyway, I just feel a bit empty after entering. The TV machine is 3 meters away from the nearest bed. It seems that the TV is much smaller.It feels okay. It is a bit rustic in the lobby. Don't go to the cherry blossom bar. The environment is really quiet. The next door is a pretty nightclub, but in addition, in the 15 -minute walk, there are no commercial facilities. There are no commercial facilities.I walked on the road at night and felt empty and unmanned. Of course, there were still many flowers and plants. There was a lake, but the lake scene ..."
1,房间非常好，早餐还好，比较满意。房间缺少针线包，客房部人员反应速度比较快，再去沈阳还住高登。,"The room is very good, breakfast is okay, and is more satisfied.The room lacks a needle line, and the staff of the guest room responds faster."
1,"酒店不错,所有香格里拉的酒店我都很喜欢,一进大堂熟悉的香格里拉特有的香味扑面而来让我不知道自己身处哪个城市.下次去应该还会住.","The hotel is good. I like all Shangri -La hotels. As soon as I entered the lobby, the fragrance of Shangri -Latt, which was familiar with the lobby, made me not know which city I was in. I should live in the next time. Next time, I should live."
1,"酒店位置很好,就在五一广场旁边.前台服务员check-in/check-out很快.房间及洗手间很整洁,服务员态度也很好.自助早餐食物很丰富.总体来说非常满意.","The hotel location is very good, just next to the May 1st Plaza. The front desk waiter Check -in/Check-OUT is very fast. The room and the bathroom are clean, and the waiter attitude is also very good. The buffet breakfast food is very rich. Overall, it is very satisfied."
1,装修的味道特重，熏的人特难受，临街的房间特吵，吵的无法入睡,"The decoration taste is particularly heavy, the smoked people are uncomfortable, the room in the street is very noisy, and the noisy can not fall asleep."
1,房间很大，交通方便。早餐还可以。下次去沈阳，还是住那。补充点评2007年12月25日：贵了一点，如果不是公司付账不会住那。,"The room is large and the traffic is convenient.Breakfast is ok.Next time I go to Shenyang, I still live there.Supplementary comment on December 25, 2007: It is more expensive."
1,服务好。环境安静、位于国贸商业区，交通方便。就是房间内有点暗。不过相对于价格，还是瑕不掩瑜。,"good service.The environment is quiet and located in the International Trade and Commercial District, and the transportation is convenient.It is a bit dark in the room.However, compared to the price, it is still flawless."
1,"优点:1.地理位置非常好,哈尔滨有代表性的景点都是徒步就到,省去和的士司机打交道的烦恼(哈尔滨的士司机真的是不怎么样).2.房间还可以,明亮,宽敞,我住的是江景房3.维修服务来得很及时.我们房间的淋浴房们坏了,不到十分钟就来人修了.4.虽然就在繁华的中央大街上,可是酒店内却很安静缺点:1.前台服务一般,速度较慢2.客房服务每天都会来敲至少2次门,打扰午休.按了请勿打扰的门灯,才没有再来敲.但是敲别人的房门时,声音仍然听得很清楚.3.早餐没什么可吃的4.门口有专门停车等待的出租,但总是觉得比自己打到的车要贵一些.而且这些出租都不太愿意去火车站(正常大约8,9块钱,可是我们坐门童叫来的出租要了我们13块)5.房间地毯不是很干净,还有烟头烫的痕迹","Advantages: 1. The geographical location is very good. The representative attractions in Harbin are on foot., Spacious, I live in Jiangjingfang 3. Maintenance services are very timely.

Press the doorlights that are not disturbed, and then do not knock again. But when knocking on the door of others,The sound still heard clearly .3. There is nothing to eat for breakfast. 4.

The carpet of the room is not very clean, and there are traces of the cigarette butt hot"
1,我和同事同时入住488元的房间，但是房型明显不同，我住的房间面积很大，但是同事住的房间和凯莱商务酒店的房间一样，感觉酒店有点糊弄人。,"My colleagues and I stayed at the room of 488 yuan at the same time, but the room type was obviously different. The room I lived in was very large, but the room where my colleagues lived in the same room, like the room of the Kaile Business Hotel, felt a little confused."
1,环境不错，前台男服务员态度比女服务员好。早餐不错，不过价格稍为高一些哦,"The environment is good, the front desk men's waiter attitude is better than female waiters.The breakfast is good, but the price is slightly higher"
1,4星那边的价格还是可以接受的，不过我今年5月5号入住的时候正在装修，给我原价320元免费升级到5星那边去了。估计还要装修一段时间，大家可以去试试运气，哈哈哈。1、早餐不怎么样，花色和口味都不怎么好。2、水果居然泡在水里，没什么味道了。3、房间的下水道居然堵住了。4、住的人非常少，估计是淡季的关系。温泉没来的及去不知道怎么样，价格大池子70几，单人间的也有300多点（据说可以洗鸳鸯浴）。补充点评2008年5月6日：半夜的时候睡觉居然后面还有‘旺财’叫个不停，早上就被鸡给morningcall了。,"The price of 4 stars is still acceptable, but when I stayed on May 5 this year, I was renovating, and the original price was 320 yuan free upgrade to 5 stars.It is estimated that you need to decorate for a while, you can try your luck, hahaha.1. Breakfast is not very good, the color and taste are not very good.2. The fruit is soaked in the water, and it has no taste.3. The sewer of the room was blocked.4. There are very few people who live, and it is estimated that it is the relationship between the off -season.I do n’t know how the hot springs do n’t come. The price is more than 70, and there are more than 300 points in the single player (it is said that you can take a bath).Supplementary comment on May 6, 2008: In the middle of the night, I still have ‘Wangcai’."
1,"酒店设施还是很不错的,房间舒适,早餐也很不错;但温泉没有想象中的那么好,不管在设施还是在娱乐性上都不能和小汤山的比,不建议大家去泡....别的都还不错的!","The hotel facilities are still very good, the room is comfortable, and the breakfast is also very good; but the hot spring is not as good as expected. It can not be compared with Xiao Tangshan in terms of facilities or entertainment.It's not bad!"
1,我住的是1号楼，准五星的房间。房间漂亮干净，服务也不错。就是沐浴的时候有点不好，淋浴的水温很不稳定，第二天提了意见，有所改善，但还是没彻底解决；浴缸的水龙头放出来的水像血一样红，肯定很久没人用，又没人定期检查。但总体还是满意的。1号楼的餐厅供应的早餐不错，品种多、味道好。,"I live in Building 1, a quasi -five -star room.The room is beautiful and clean, and the service is good.It is a bit bad when bathing. The water temperature of the shower is very unstable. The next day, the opinions were made, but it was not completely solved.No one checked regularly.But overall is still satisfied.The restaurant in Building 1 is good for breakfast, there are many varieties and good tastes."
1,客房和餐厅的服务都不错，总台的办事速度也挺快。但楼层好像没电话，我忘带房卡还要下到总台，电梯有点慢。,"The service of the rooms and restaurants is good, and the speed of the main station is also very fast.But there seems to be no call in the floor. I forgot to bring the house card to the main station, and the elevator is a bit slow."
1,房间的设施挺好，服务态度也还好，就是周围的环境不怎么样，离景区还算近，处于中间位置。要是能收到HBO，CNN之类的电台就更好了。还有早餐应该更丰富些。,"The facilities in the room are very good, and the service attitude is also good, that is, the surrounding environment is not good. It is quite close to the scenic area and is in the middle position.It would be better if you can receive HBO and CNN.There is also a richer breakfast."
1,对粤财一直想评价，一直偷懒没有写春节期间定的是行政房。行政房内的设施非常满意。而且，还可以在行政酒廊免费用点心。行政房办理入住的小姐很和蔼，热情，但也不是热情做作。笑容感觉很温软。由于原先定的是双人的，到时房间已经没有了。小姐推荐KINGSIZE的大床房，由于女儿习惯一人睡，要求加床被子，也马上得到了满足。床很舒服，被子也很柔软。。感觉很好。。。除去价格外，十分满意。但觉得可以接受。。。要是再便宜点，就更好了。。。,"He has always wanted to evaluate Yuecai, and has been lazy and not writing the administrative house during the Spring Festival.The facilities in the administrative house are very satisfied.Moreover, you can also use the snacks for free in the administrative lounge.The lady who checked in administrative houses is very kind and enthusiastic, but it is not enthusiastic.The smile feels soft.Since the original two were dual, the room was gone at that time.Miss recommended Kingsize's big bed room.

1,"房间非常大,很干净,感觉很舒服,前台服务员比较有礼貌,应该是珠海最好的酒店.离口岸有点远,大约十分钟车程,自己开车问题不大,坐出租车应该也方便.价格有点贵,但是有一个前台服务员还很漂亮啊!哈哈!加分!","The room is very large, very clean, and it feels very comfortable.

1,距离市区比较远，房间还算干净，设施一般，但是对于这个价格，在天津还是不时很实惠的，早餐价格高，而且食物不好吃,"It is far from the urban area, the room is quite clean and the facilities are average, but for this price, it is still affordable from time to time in Tianjin. The price of breakfast is high, and the food is not delicious"
1,交道便利，近民航售票处，房间大整洁，但早餐实在一般。,"Conveniences are convenient, the room is close to the SAIC ticket office, and the room is clean, but breakfast is really average."

1,据说是青岛最贵的酒店之一，房间很温馨，但卫生间感觉好像有些旧。其他都还好。,"It is said to be one of the most expensive hotels in Qingdao. The room is very warm, but the bathroom feels a bit old.Everything else is fine."
1,房间有法式风格，尤其浴室和化妆间的布置。不过淋浴房的防水做的不好，洗完澡浴室地面全是水，差点摔跤。宾馆反馈2008年4月11日：非常感谢您的光临和对我们饭店的关注和肯定。对于您提出的不足我们将努力改进，力求把工作做得更好，给宾客提供更优质、更舒适的硬件设施和软件服务。,"The room has a French style, especially the layout of the bathroom and dressing room.However, the waterproof of the shower room is not good.

1,"早餐非常差。本人是冲着西餐厅去的，转了一圈后怀疑自己走错了地方，因为一半以上的菜品是中餐。无论西餐、中餐菜品都很差，没有上档次的菜。蔬菜只有很便宜的两三种，肠是两种混放在一个盘子里，而且只有几片。没有任何鱼虾海鲜。实在没什么可吃的，最后我是啃了两个玉米才填饱了肚子。宾馆反馈2008年2月4日：非常感谢您的光临。同时对您向我们饭店服务中提出的不足之处致以诚挚的谢意。饭店二楼西餐厅的早餐以美式早餐为主,在西式菜品的基础上结合本地人的口味加入部分中式菜品，在三楼中餐厅我们还为客人提供地道川（粤）式早点。我们在以后的工作中定将更加努力,对每位客人提出的不足加以分析和改进,尽量满足宾客的需求。","Breakfast is very bad.I went to the Western Restaurant. After turning around, I suspected that I had gone the wrong place because more than half of the dishes were Chinese food.Western and Chinese food are poor, and there are no grade dishes.There are only two or three very cheap vegetables.

In the end, I took two corn to fill my stomach.Hotel feedback on February 4, 2008: Thank you very much for your visit.At the same time, sincere thanks to the shortcomings of your restaurant services are sincere thanks.The breakfast on the second floor of the restaurant is mainly American breakfast. Based on Western dishes, it is combined with the taste of the local people to add some Chinese dishes. In the Chinese restaurant on the third floor, we also provide guests with authentic Sichuan (Guangdong) early.We will work harder in the future work, analyze and improve the shortcomings of each guest, and try to meet the needs of guests as much as possible."
1,价格还可以，在四星级酒店中比较便宜的。交通很不方便，就在五环边上，门口的路是单行的辅路，出行不方便。周边没有吃饭的地方。,"The price is okay, which is cheaper in four -star hotels.Traffic is very inconvenient. On the side of the Fifth Ring Road, the road at the door is a one -way auxiliary road, and it is inconvenient to travel.There is no place to eat around."
1,位置不是很好找，晚上有霓虹灯还好一些，白天就困难许多,"The location is not very easy to find. It is better to have neon lights at night, and it is much difficult during the day."
1,我并没有实际前往，而是帮我经理预定的。但是我经理回来对这个酒店评价还可以，和我说NOBAD，我想应该还是可以的了。,"I didn't actually go, but for my manager to book.But my manager comes back to evaluate this hotel, and tell me Nobad, I think it should be okay."
1,"出差途中无意中获得一张携程旅行网会员卡,通过网络订房及上网查询酒店的有关介绍,对其介绍的诸多荣誉很是好奇,入住期间所享受到的服务与大堂的荣誉榜甚是吻合,住宿、用餐、K歌及价位偶总体很满意。在此，谢谢携程网！谢谢石狮五洲大酒店！","On a business trip, I accidentally got a Ctrip travel network member card. Through the introduction of the hotel through the online booking and online querying the hotel, many honors they introduced were curious.Accommodation, meals, K songs and price puppets are generally very satisfied.Thank you Ctrip.com!Thank you Shishi Wuzhou Hotel!"
1,"昨日再次入住五洲,总体感觉很好,各方面服务都很到位,特别是客房服务员的拾金不昧精神让我印象最为深刻,下次到石狮出差,依然会首选五洲.","Yesterday, I stayed in Wuzhou again. The overall feeling was very good. The services in all aspects were in place. Especially the room waiter's gold -picked spirit made me most impressive. Next time I went to Shishi to travel on a business trip, I will still be preferred by the five continents."
1,"在该酒店住过，感觉挺舒适，特别是服务挺周到，中餐菜肴特别营养丰富可口，别具特色！记得要提前预订哦!经常满座,用餐还要排队等候了。","I have lived in the hotel and feels very comfortable, especially the service is very thoughtful. Chinese food dishes are particularly nutritious and delicious, and have unique features!Remember to book it in advance! Often full of seats, you have to wait in line for meals."
1,"还不错,来过石狮这么多回,就这家有档次,客房特别舒适,价格合理,物有所值,菜很好吃,就店很热闹,我在旁边办事方便","It's not bad. I have been here so many times, just have a grade, the guest rooms are particularly comfortable, the price is reasonable, the food is worth it, the dishes are delicious, the shop is very lively, I can do things next to it."
1,在济宁还算是个不错的酒店，毕竟这里只有两家四星，服务还算不错。,"It is a good hotel in Jining. After all, there are only two four stars here, and the service is pretty good."
1,住了多次，感觉还是一般。灯光太暗，配置较简单-美其名曰：环保。,"I lived many times, and it felt average.The lights are too dark, and the configuration is simpler-Meiqi name: environmental protection."
1,"服务态度比较好,很亲切,早餐品种也比较丰富,只是味道不是太好.房间设施一般,毛巾看上去有些陈旧,周围吃饭的地方比较少,因为在开发区,离市区还是有一定距离,总的说来还行.只是济宁这个地方好的酒店也不多,所以相比较而言,这里还值得入住.","The service attitude is relatively good, very kind, and the breakfast variety is relatively rich, but the taste is not very good. The room facilities are average, the towels look a little old, and there are fewer places to eat around. Because in the development zone, there is still a certain distance from the urban area.Generally speaking, there are not many good hotels in Jining, so in comparison, it is worth checking here."
1,两个人同行入住，应该安排不同楼层，保护各自隐私，香港大厦似乎不知道这个惯例,Two people stay with each other and should arrange different floors to protect their selfishness. The Hong Kong Building does not seem to know this practice.
1,青岛就一个香格里拉是协议的，没房的情况就住这一个酒店，感觉还算可以了．不过还有需要改善的地方了,"Qingdao is an agreement with a Shangri -La. If there is no room, you stay in this hotel. It feels okay.But there are places that need to be improved"
1,"我住的是两室一厅的房间,在17楼.虽然只住了一夜,但总体来说,对这个公寓感觉不错.就是有几点不满意:1.地方确实不好找,没有醒目的标志,第一次去还真难找.2.没有一次性拖鞋,而是塑料拖鞋.3.浴缸很大,但是没有浴帘,我们住的那间,浴室的门都坏了.4.并没有两个卫生间,只是把一间分成了两间.不足的地方就这些,总体给我的感觉像家一样,有客厅和厨房,感觉很温馨.床很舒服,地方也很安静,能休息好,前台服务态度也很好,.下次去还是愿意住这里.","I live in a two -bedroom and one -living room. On the 17th floor. Although I only lived for one night, in general, I feel good for this apartment. I have a few unsatisfactory points: 1. The place is really not easy to find, not eye -catching, not eye -catching.Logo, it is really difficult to find for the first time. 2. There is no one -time slippers, but plastic slippers .3. The bathtub is large, but there is no shower curtain.There are no two bathrooms, just divide one into two. Insufficient places, the general feeling is like home, there are living rooms and kitchens, it feels very warm., The front desk service attitude is also very good,. I still want to live here next time."
1,我是第一次住公寓式的酒店，感觉很棒。一进客房特宽敞明亮。我住的是一室一厅套房，干净整洁，服务员的态度非常好。我是和姐姐一起过来的，她喜欢看日本台，这里能收到好多国际频道呢！楼上的餐厅也是我喜欢的那种画廊式餐厅，非常Mordern哦，如果是一家人来这里真的很超值方便呢，值得推荐一去啊～～～～补充点评2008年1月24日：房间很大很超值，远远高于三星级酒店的标准，可以跟四星级的媲美了呢～很棒～如果下次到北京我还是会到这,"I was the first apartment -style hotel and felt great.As soon as you enter the room, the room is spacious and bright.I live in one -bedroom and one -living suit, clean and tidy, and the waiter's attitude is very good.I came here with my sister. She likes to watch Japan. I can receive a lot of international channels here!The restaurant upstairs is also the kind of gallery -style restaurant that I like. It is very MordERN. It is really great and convenient to come here if a family comes here. It is worth recommending it ~~~~ Add comments January 24, 2008:The room is very large and valuable, far higher than the standard of three -star hotels, which can be comparable to the four -star ones ~ Very great ~ If I still arrive in Beijing next time, I will still be here."
1,"据我昆山一个搞装潢的朋友讲,这家酒店的大堂和客房选用的石材、家具、卫浴设备都很高档,以性价比来说挺超值的.所以以前出差到昆山都住这家酒店.半年没来了,这次来发现他们员工都换了新制服,大堂的很多装饰也焕然一新,走进大堂还有淡淡的香味,还蛮惊喜的.之前几次一直住主楼,这次订房想换个风格,就选了他们的商务楼.这边房间和主楼配备几乎相同,只是卫生间是透明的,可以一边泡澡一边看电视,估计也是他们的一个卖点.今天上网无意中点开他们家的""所有房型""才发现,可能是夏天酒店业淡季的原因,现在携程上面订行政客房就能送1份108元早餐和50元足浴,还有鲜花水果报纸什么的.细算下来,搞促销的时候住行政客房还是很划算的,但愿下次过去的时候这个活动还没结束.这次入住唯一感觉不太满意的就是办入住的时间有点长,扫描证件弄了好几分钟,不过奥运期间好象酒店都这样.宾馆反馈2008年8月14日：尊敬的客人:您好感谢您选择君豪酒店,除了行政客房外,我们还有商务豪华客房也有优惠的促销,同样是订房就送早餐和足浴券.关于您所说的证件登记的问题,我们也是在配合奥运期间公安部门的安全规定,极力为客人提供一个安全舒适的环境,也请您能够理解.欢迎您下次入住,我们一定会为您提供优质的更好的服务.","According to a friend of a decorative decoration in Kunshan, the lobby and rooms of this hotel are very high -end, and it is very value for cost -effectiveness.Not here, this time I found that their employees have changed their uniforms, and many decorations in the lobby are renewed. There is a faint fragrance when I walk into the lobby., I chose their business buildings. The room here is almost the same as the main building, but the bathroom is transparent. You can watch TV while bathing. It is estimated that it is also a selling point for them.The room type ""discovered that it may be the reason for the off -season of the hotel industry in the summer. Now Ctrip can give 1 out of 108 yuan breakfast and 50 yuan foot bath when booking the administrative room on it, and the flowers and fruit newspapers.The administrative rooms are still very cost -effective. I hope that the event is not over next time. The only thing that I don't feel very satisfied with this time is that the time to handle is a bit long.They are all like this. Hotel feedback on August 14, 2008: Dear guest: Hello, thank you for choosing Junhao Hotel. In addition to administrative guest rooms, we also have business luxury rooms also have discounts.. Regarding what you said, the issue of documents registered, we also cooperate with the security regulations of the public security department during the Olympic Games and strive to provide guests with a safe and comfortable environment. Please understand. Welcome to stay in the next time, we will definitely be for you for you.Provide high -quality and better services."
1,酒店设施齐全，服务周到离海边很近，适合晚上出去散步,"The hotel facilities are complete, and the service is very close to the seaside. It is suitable for walking at night"
1,前台藏的太靠里面，大床房很不错，服务也不错，只是浴室喷淋是固定的，最好再加一个可以拿在手里的小喷头。总体感觉还是满意的，可以作为常住酒店。,"The front desk is too dependent on it. The big bed room is very good and the service is good. However, the bathroom spray is fixed. It is best to add a small nozzle that can be held in your hand.Overall feeling is still satisfied, it can be used as a permanent hotel."
1,"5月21日入住,大床房空间很大,和价格相符.如再便宜点就更有竞争力.宾馆反馈2008年6月27日：感谢您的点评及对我们酒店的赞赏,从6.28日起我们每个周末都有优惠的房价,欢迎您下次入住.","Checking in on May 21, the large bed room has a lot of space, which is consistent with the price. If it is cheaper, it will be more competitive. Hotel feedback on June 27, 2008: Thank you for your reviews and appreciation for our hotel. From 6.28From each weekend we have discount house prices, you are welcome to stay in the next time."
1,房间还是对得起这个价格，优点是这里的每间房间都是正对三亚湾的海。缺点就是酒店没泳池，住一晚还行，但作为度假，酒店设施硬件差了点，其实酒店就是一整幢大楼，没绿化没游泳池那种。还有个优点，酒店能免费接机，门口公交很多，去大东海，去亚龙湾都有公交车，这点很不错，节省了很多打车费用。补充点评2008年6月30日：对了，这个酒店的排水系统真的很差，马桶都冲不干净，让人心情因为马桶而变差。。。。希望改进。,"The room is still worthy of this price. The advantage is that every room here is facing the sea of Sanya Bay.The disadvantage is that the hotel does not have a swimming pool. It is okay to stay for one night, but as a vacation, the hardware of the hotel's facilities is a bit worse. In fact, the hotel is a whole building. There is no greening and no swimming pool.There is also an advantage that the hotel can pick up the aircraft for free. There are many buses at the door. There are buses to Dadonghai and Yalong Bay. This is very good, saving a lot of taxi fees.Supplementary reviews June 30, 2008: By the way, the drainage system of this hotel is really bad, the toilet is not clean, making people feel bad because of the toilet.EssenceEssenceEssenceHope to improve."
1,相当喜欢这家酒店。首先是地理位置，前临海滩（隔一条马路，只有20米距离），后临闹市，无论是海边戏水还是市区闲逛都很方便，打车直接说仙居府的士司机都认识；其次是内部设施，很干净，服务态度也挺不错的；而且我们住在顶层13楼，打开落地窗走进阳台，满眼的碧波荡漾，景色超好！唯一的美中不足，是我们到酒店checkin时，我们预订的豪华海景大床房已经给了别的客人没有了-_-，前台服务员支支吾吾地说大床房正对电梯位置不好，建议我们换成海景标准间，让我们有些不爽……不过在我们的坚持和理论下，最后问题还是很好地解决了：第一天给我们免费升级到高级海景大床房，第二天我们搬回了高层的预订房间，总体来说服务态度还是很好的。短期内若有亲戚朋友去三亚，一定会推荐仙居府的！~：）,"I like this hotel quite quite.The first is the geographical location. The front beach (a road across a road, only 20 meters away), and it is very convenient to go to the city. Whether it is seaside and the urban area, it is very convenient.The internal facilities are very clean and the service attitude is pretty good; and we live on the 13th floor of the top floor, open the floor -to -ceiling window and enter the balcony. The eyes are full of blue waves and the scenery is super good!The only lack of beauty is that when we went to the hotel to checkin, the luxurious seascape large bed room we reserved had given other guests.Instead of the seascape standard room, we are a little uncomfortable ... but under our persistence and theory, the final problem is solved well: On the first day, we will upgrade to a high -end seascape large bed room for free. The next day we move backThe high -rise booking room is generally good in service attitude.If a relative and friends go to Sanya in the short term, they will be recommended to Xianjufu!~ :)"
1,4月4日下午入住，4月5日18时退房。之前一直感觉服务不错，有求必应，而且快速有效解决。但退房时不愉快，原因是一烟灰盅找不到了。恼火在于房间居然没有物品清单，酒店方单方说少了何物，顾客百口莫辩，不能入住时就有所留意，最后虽然找到但说明酒店的服务意识尚欠缺。酒店硬件本可更上层楼：二楼延伸露天平台可做泳池；一楼餐厅住客用餐应有优惠。等等。如此酒店才能真正配上“温馨”、“渡假”4字。此外三亚的市政规划还得上档次：好好一条临海的三亚湾路，都给乱车糟蹋掉了，令那里的海景房“钱”景受限。,"Check in on the afternoon of April 4, and check out at 18:00 on April 5.I have always felt that the service has been good before, it must be responding, and it is quickly and effective.However, it was unhappy when checking out, because the ash cup could not be found.The annoyance is that there is no list of items in the room. The hotel's unilateral one says less. Customers are unable to pay attention to it. They can't pay attention when they cannot stay.Hotel hardware can be even more upper floor: The extension of the open -air platform on the second floor can be used as a swimming pool; the dining guests on the first floor should have discounts.etc.In this way, the hotel can really be equipped with the words ""warm"" and ""vacation"".In addition, the municipal planning of Sanya must be grade: a good Sanya Bay Road in the sea, all of them spoiled the chaos, causing the sea view room to ""money"" to be limited."
1,总的来说还可以但288的价格没有什么竞争力一楼的自助餐比较便宜38元但基本上没什么吃的房间的地毯太旧了已经泛白显得很脏比起绍兴的雅豪真的是差得远没有骚扰电话房间很安静前台办事效率比较高补充点评2008年4月21日：没有送水果离高速公路出口很近,"In general, it is okay but the price of 288 is not competitive on the first floor. The buffet on the first floor is more cheaper. The carpet in the room that is not eaten is too old. It has been white.There is no harassment phone. The room is very quiet at the front desk efficiency. The efficiency of the front desk is relatively high. Add comments. April 21, 2008: No fruit is sent to the highway exit."
1,所定的房价间并不是水床房，那里水床只有两间，房间的空气并不好，很闷。,The fixed house price room is not a sewing room. There are only two sewers there. The air in the room is not good and very stuffy.
1,非常好，特别是休闲房。早餐非常丰富。再来还住。,"Very good, especially the casual room.Breakfast is very rich.Come and live again."
1,服切，所有服人到客人都打招呼，房置高雅。酒店在道旁，出入方便，但啥地方逛街，後面有菜市及夜市商，人出差非常合。入住天是冬至夜，我去小超市了一包，回到酒店大堂理助我吩咐房煮我吃，不到半小就送了，很切的服，下次到安！！,"If you take it, all the people will say hello to the guests, and the room is elegant.The hotel is beside the road, which is convenient to enter and exit, but where to go shopping, there are vegetable markets and night market merchants in the back.It was the winter solstice at the day of the stay. I went to the small supermarket and returned to the hotel lobby to help me instruct the room to cook. It would be delivered in less than half a young age.Intersection"
1,应该是不错，就是下面的餐饮价格奇贵，一天房价500不到，两个人吃饭花了500多，MG,"It should be good, that is, the price of catering below is not expensive. The price of houses in a day is less than 500, and the two people spend more than 500 meals. MG"
1,"周末去海宁玩了两天,住海洲,总体评价应该不错.房间很大,设施也不错,如果是液晶电视那就好了.早餐值得推荐.离皮革城非常近,但周围就没有什么设施了.值得推荐!",I went to Haining for two days on the weekend. I lived in Haizhou. The overall evaluation should be good. The room is large and the facilities are good.It is worth recommending!
1,总的先说一句话，徽商国际大酒店实在是太差！！！服务差！！！饭菜质量差！！！这个月初，我带了一家老小去黄山旅游，通过携程预订了两间商务单间（大床），到达酒店后，酒店给我们住在18楼。在办手续时，总台告诉我说房间刚装修好，服务指南还没配置，有问题直接和总台联系。进了房间才发现不止服务指南没配置，应有的一些设施也没配置，我的小孩爱吃酸奶，所以随身携带了些，想放到小冰箱里，结果没找到，我住过的其他酒店里的商务方都有小冰箱。和总台联系，总台说18楼是新装修，小冰箱还没配，16楼以下的房间就有，很郁闷。安顿下后来到酒店3楼吃饭，点了些菜，味道都一般，但让我吃惊的是我点的清蒸千岛湖白水鱼端上来时是凉的，而且鱼汤是酱油红汤，问了服务员，说是浇了点美极酱油，我是江浙一带的人，清蒸鱼经常吃，从没见过清蒸还放酱油的。前几天住在临安的杭州青山湖度假酒店刚吃过清蒸白水鱼，人家就没放酱油。告诉服务员鱼是凉的，她说鱼拿上来就是这样的，还温着呢！我连凉和温都分不清了？！后来上来的脆皮乳鸽更是离谱，切得稀烂，看不出是个鸽子，外形上去更像盘卤菜--潮州的卤鸽，没有一点脆皮的感觉。找来餐饮经理，我说你们不是说是准五星酒店吗，怎么烧菜是这样的水平?经理说他们酒店是按准五星建的，其实还没评上星级，原来如此，那对他们的烧菜大师傅的水平就不能太计较了。给我们退了乳鸽，重新做鱼。等了半天，鱼上来了，这次总算没放酱油了，尝了一口，两个字：难吃，三个字：太难吃。鱼蒸的老不说，没有一点鲜鱼的味道，以我从小吃到大的吃鱼的经验，我可以肯定地说，这根本不是现杀的活鱼，而是用盐水腌过的鱼。整盘鱼就放那浪费了。吃完饭在楼层走了一圈，似乎只有我们一家，楼层的安全通道外的地上好像还堆着水泥，安全通道这边的电梯还在运送装修材料。乘坐电梯时发现其他客人都住在8、9楼，有服务员告诉我们酒店是半年前开业的，18、19楼刚装修好！！！我看是没装修好就营业了，不知道携程搞不定酒店，还是酒店歧视携程的客人，竟然把没装修好的楼层的房间给我们住，很愤怒！！！出于安全因素考虑，我们要求酒店换房，酒店说现在只有15、16层有商务单间（大床），而且各只有一间，问他们其他楼层有没有，客房部经理说他们酒店房间就是这么建造的，每层都只有一间大床房，我感到很奇怪，难道准五星的酒店的客房设置标准就是这样的？同一房型不是建在同一楼层？而且一种房型一层只有一间？提出疑问后酒店说可以把每间空房打开给我们看是否是这样，不愿再找麻烦了，就要了一间商务单间（大床）和对门的一间商务标间（双床）。逛完屯溪老街的夜市回来，发现安全通道这边的电梯可以从底楼直接上任何楼层，而且没人管，安全通道的门也没上锁。也就是说任何人都可以通过安全通道这边的电梯上任何楼层的房间而不被注意到，太没安全感了！！！！！另外说明一下：第二天我们又住到了海宁的海州大酒店，同样要了两间大床房（标准间），酒店就给我们安排在同一楼层对门的两间房，而且一间是家庭房（一张大床和一张单床），办手续的时候我们没有提出任何要求，酒店主动为我们安排了这样的两间房，这很让我们满意，这样的服务才是一个正规酒店应该提供的。而且靠马路的房间是双层玻璃隔音，很周到。下次我去海宁的话我还会住海州大酒店，但是到黄山的话，我是再也不会去住徽商国际大酒店了。个人建议：到黄山不要住徽商国际大酒店，它的硬件马马虎虎（毕竟是新装修，但没完全搞好就开业也太说不过去了），软件太差。我对它的评价是：一个字：差，两个字：太差，三个字：差差差，四个字：实在是差。,"In general, a word is too bad!IntersectionIntersectionPoor service!IntersectionIntersectionPoor meals!IntersectionIntersectionEarlier this month, I brought a family to Huangshan to travel. I reservations for two business rooms (big beds) through Ctrip. After arriving at the hotel, the hotel lived on the 18th floor.When running the formalities, the main station told me that the room was just renovated, the service guide was not configured, and there was a problem with the main station.After entering the room, I found that not only the service guide was not configured, and some facilities I did not configure. My child loves yogurt, so I carried it with me. I wanted to put it in the small refrigerator.The business party has a small refrigerator.Contact with the main station, the main station said that the 18th floor was a new decoration, and the small refrigerator was not yet equipped. The room below the 16th floor was very depressed.After settling down, I went to the 3rd floor of the hotel to eat. I ordered some dishes, and the taste was average, but what surprised me was that when I ordered the steamed Thousand Island Lake Baishui Fish, it was cold, and the fish soup was soy sauce red soup. I asked the waiter.It is said that it was poured a bit of beautiful soy sauce. I am a person in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. I often eat steamed fish. I have never seen steamed soy sauce.A few days ago, I lived in the Hangzhou Qingshan Lake Resort Hotel in Lin'an just eaten steamed white water fish, and they did not put soy sauce.Tell the waiter that the fish is cold. She said that the fish was like this, and it was warm!I ca n’t tell even if I ca n’t even distinguish between Liangliang and Wen?IntersectionLater, the crispy pigeon pigeons came up evenly, and they were rotten. They couldn't see that it was a pigeon. The shape was more like a braised vegetable-Chaozhou's marinated pigeons. There was no feeling of crispy skin.Come to the catering manager, I said, are you not saying that you are quasi -five -star hotels, how can you cook vegetables? The manager said that their hotel was built at the five -star.The level of the master of cooking can not be too much.Give us back the pigeons and make fish again.After waiting for a long time, the fish came up. This time I didn't put soy sauce. Taste a bite. Two words: unpalatable, three words: too unpalatable.I do n’t say that the fish is steaming. There is no taste of fresh fish. With my experience of eating fish from snacks to big fish, I can say certain that this is not a living fish that is now killed, but fish marinated with salt water.The whole plate of fish wasted.After eating, I walked around the floor. It seemed that there was only our family. The ground outside the floor of the floor seemed to be still piled up with cement. The elevator on the safe passage was still transporting decoration materials.When taking the elevator, I found that other guests lived on the 8th and 9th floor. Some waiters told us that the hotel opened half a year ago. The 18th and 19th floor was just renovated!IntersectionIntersectionI think it ’s the business without renovation. I do n’t know that Ctrip is not sure of the hotel, or the guests who discriminate against Ctrip in the hotel. They even gave us a room that did not renovate the floor. It was angry!IntersectionIntersectionFor security factors, we asked the hotel to change the house. The hotel said that there are only 15 or 16 floors with business single rooms (large beds), and there is only one room. Ask them if there are other floors.I have only one large bed in each floor. I feel very strange. Is this the standard for setting up the guest room setting of the five -star hotel?Isn't the same room type built on the same floor?And there is only one room type one floor?After asking questions, the hotel said that each empty room can be opened to us to see if it is like this. If you don't want to find any trouble, you will ask a business single room (large bed) and a business standard room (double bed).After visiting the night market on the old street of Tunxi, I found that the elevator on the safe passage can go directly to any floor from the bottom floor, and no one cares, and the door of the safe passage is not locked.In other words, anyone can go through the room on the elevator on the elevator on the safe passage without being noticed. It is too insecure!IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionAnother explanation: The next day we stayed at the Haizhou Hotel in Haining again, and also asked two large bed rooms (standard rooms). The hotel arranged for two rooms on the same floor to the same floor, and one was a family family.The room (a large bed and a single bed), we did not make any requests during the procedures. The hotel took the initiative to arrange such two rooms for us. This is very satisfiedof.And the room on the road is double -layer glass sound insulation, which is very thoughtful.The next time I go to Haining, I will stay in the Haizhou Hotel, but when I get to Huangshan, I will never go to the Huishang International Hotel anymore.Personal suggestions: Do not stay in Huishang International Hotel in Huangshan. Its hardware is sloppy (after all, it is a new decoration, but it is too bad to open if it is not fully opened), the software is too bad.My evaluation of it is: one word: poor, two words: too bad, three words: difference, four words: really bad."
1,总体来说，这是一个比较不错的酒店，房间比较新而且也较大，尤其是卫生间与房间的隔断蛮有意思的，有一点稍有缺憾的是浴袍虽然很干净，但也比较旧了（已经出现丝丝缕缕了），建议更换。酒店服务员的整体素质比较高，也很热情。晚上喝了酒不能开车，在酒店门口打车的时候发现出租车大多数都拼车，这一点比较奇怪。,"In general, this is a relatively good hotel. The room is relatively new and larger, especially the interval between the bathroom and the room is quite interesting. A little bit of regret is that although the bathrobe is very clean, it is relatively old.It has already appeared), it is recommended to replace.The overall quality of hotel waiters is relatively high and very enthusiastic.I ca n’t drive in the evening when I drink alcohol. When I was a taxi at the hotel door, most taxis were carpooling. This is strange."
1,环境还不错，旁边就是华师，在华师参加考试是个不错的选择。缺点就是没有留加床的位置，加床后非常小，另外就是价格定的有点高了。宾馆反馈2008年7月1日：感谢阁下的宝贵意见，酒店有个别房间是适合配置加床的，如阁下需要加床，可在预订时提出需求，我们将尽力为阁下安排，期待阁下再次入住我们酒店。,"The environment is not bad, next to the Chinese division, taking the exam in the Chinese division is a good choice.The disadvantage is that there is no place to stay in bed. It is very small after implantation, and the price is a bit high.Hotel feedback on July 1, 2008: Thank you for your precious opinions. There are individual rooms in the hotel that are suitable for configuration and bed.Our hotel."
1,房间整体感觉十分干净，环境也比较清静，虽然临街一边的客房要相对吵一些，但是隔音做的不错,"The whole room feels very clean and the environment is relatively quiet. Although the rooms on the side of the street are relatively noisy, the sound insulation is good"
1,六号楼是龙岩地区目前最好的宾馆，硬件很新，服务也还可以，感觉很不错。但美中不足的是暖气不行，晚上冻醒，希望改进。宾馆反馈2008年3月12日：感谢您提的宝贵意见，宾馆已经针对您的建议作出改进。期待您的再次光临。,"Building 6 is currently the best hotel in Longyan. The hardware is very new and the service is OK. It feels very good.But the disadvantage is that the heating is not good, and it is frozen at night, hoping to improve.Hotel feedback on March 12, 2008: Thank you for your precious opinions. The hotel has made improvements on your suggestions.welcome next time."
1,我住的一号楼，楼下KTV比较吵。早餐实在是太差，连蛋糕都没有的，纯粹中国式的，包子咸鸭蛋等。宾馆反馈2008年3月12日：感谢客人的建议，现在宾馆免费向每位客人提供品种多样的中式和西式早餐。,"I lived in Building 1, and KTV downstairs was more noisy.Breakfast is too bad, there is no cake, pure Chinese style, buns salted duck eggs, etc.Hotel feedback on March 12, 2008: Thank you for your suggestions. Now the hotel provides a variety of Chinese and Western breakfast for each guest for free."
1,优点：酒店的地理位置是没的说的了，闹中取静，购物、出行都很方便；进了房间很有家的感觉，各类设施齐全，如果是一家人去真的是很惬意；早餐很不错，外面还有个屋顶花园很是别致；缺点：这次住的是04号房间，不方便的是电视在客厅里，大床是1.5米的，有点小了，三口之家的话就没法考虑了（要安排个人睡沙发了），在这个上面比宾馆是不足的，如果改进的话肯定是首选的酒店了。,"Advantages: The geographical location of the hotel is not said. It is convenient to get quiet in trouble, shopping and travel; it feels good at entering the room, and all kinds of facilities are complete.Breakfast is very good. There is also a roof garden outside. Disadvantages: This time I live in Room 04. It is inconvenient to be in the living room. The big bed is 1.5 meters, which is a bit small.I can't consider it (I have to arrange a personal sleeping sofa). This is not enough than the hotel. If it is improved, it must be the preferred hotel."
1,"房间很温馨,地段很好,购物方便,停车位也有,如价格再优惠些,更好!下次去还会选择入住","The room is very warm, the location is very good, the shopping is convenient, and there are parking spaces. If the price is more favorable, it is better! I will choose to stay next time"
1,差不多是亚龙湾的酒店里最便宜的，住的豪华单人间，房间比较干净，设施也还齐全，不好的地方是小冰箱在柜子里面散热不好，几乎没法制冷，如果敞开着柜子门又太吵。酒店没有专属的沙滩，最近的沙滩上都是旅游团的人，比较乱。,"It's almost the cheapest in the hotel in Yalong Bay. The luxurious single room lives in the room. The room is relatively clean and the facilities are still complete. The bad place is that the small refrigerator is not good for the heat dissipation in the cabinet.Too noisy.The hotel does not have an exclusive beach. The nearest beach is a tourist group, which is more chaotic."
1,酒店服务满好，房间设施不超过四星，晚上没有骚扰电话。宾馆反馈2008年6月16日：谢谢,"The hotel has a good service, the room facilities do not exceed four stars, and there are no harassment calls at night.Hotel feedback on June 16, 2008: Thank you"
1,不是我本人入住的，但是同事前后三次去淄博出差，每次都要求我帮他们定这家酒店，看来他们挺满意的，想来应该是不错的。,"It wasn't for myself, but my colleague went to Zibo three times before and after, and asked me to help them set this hotel every time. It seems that they are very satisfied. It should be good to think."
1,"感非常好,一已有一家的感.我一行8人,入住三房套房,很乾,境很好.前台服很好,忙叫和提供旅行信息.我凌晨check-out,迫,前台很快.地理位置很方便,十至十五分可以步行到淮海中路和地站.下次去上海一定再入住酒店.","I feel very good, I already have a sense of one family. I have 8 people and stays in the three-bedroom suit. It is very dry and the realm is very good. The front desk service is very good. I am busy and provide travel information.Quick. The geographical location is very convenient. You can walk to the middle of the Huaihai Middle Road and the ground station. Next time you go to Shanghai, you must stay in the hotel again."
1,不错，房间够大，无论是硬件还是软件都足够过关。值得推荐！,"Yes, the room is large enough, both hardware and software are enough to pass.Recommended!"
1,2007年8月17日晚上回程路上临时通过电话预定，酒店位于淮安楚州周总理纪念馆旁边，京沪高速下来很方便。但是距离楚州市中心比较远(不过楚州也不大）。该酒店应该是电力下属的三产吧，服务一般的很，和三星的标准有点距离，号称2004年重新装修过，估计入住的人不多，房间还算整洁，但是比较郁闷的是床上的被单不是很干净，不知道是没有洗干净还是没有换过，早上天亮看看真的如此。这个是绝对不应该的。如果有时间还是选择其他的酒店吧，半夜看的不是很清楚，附近有一个四星的酒店正好位于湖边，景色应该不错。,"On the evening of August 17, 2007, I was temporarily reserved by phone on the way back to the journey. The hotel was located next to the Memorial Museum of Chuzhou Chuzhou, Huai'an. The Beijing -Shanghai high speed was very convenient.But it is far from the center of Chuzhou (but Chuzhou is not large).The hotel should be the three production of the subordinates of power. The service is very general. It is a bit far from the standard of Samsung. It is known as renovation in 2004. It is estimated that there are not many people who stay in.It ’s not very clean. I do n’t know if I’ m not washed or changed. It ’s true in the morning.This is absolutely not.If you have time, you still choose other hotels. It is not very clear to see in the middle of the night. There is a four -star hotel nearby near the lake. The scenery should be good."
1,帮朋友预定了两天，以下是他的评价：优点：1、服务热情，态度很好。2、送双早。3、房间干净，客房服务员工作利索，效率也高。4、热水很足，虽然在16楼，水压也很大。缺点：1、上网不稳定，好像是网线质量不好。2、30度了都不开空调，后来估计反映的顾客多了，晚上就开了空调。不过要了个电扇，很快就送来了。3、早餐单调了点。下面几个是我的评价：1、停车超方便，停车场很大，地面地下的都有，保安指挥得不错。2、交通挺方便的，紧靠高架和德胜路，都是主干道。3、因为紧靠主干道，所以可能噪音大一点。呵呵，就这些了。,"After helping friends to book for two days, the following is his evaluation: advantages: 1. Service enthusiasm and good attitude.2. Send Double Early.3. The room is clean, the guest room waiters work sharply, and the efficiency is high.4. The hot water is sufficient, although on the 16th floor, the water pressure is also very large.Disadvantages: 1. Unstable access to the Internet, it seems that the quality of the network cable is not good.2, 30 degrees, did not turn on the air conditioner. Later, it was estimated that there were many customers who reflected, and the air conditioner was turned on at night.But I asked for an electric fan, and it was delivered soon.3. Breakfast is monotonous.The following are my evaluation: 1. The parking is super convenient, the parking lot is large, there are all the grounds, and the security command is good.2. The traffic is very convenient. It is close to the highway and Desheng Road, both of which are the main roads.3. Because it is close to the main road, the noise may be lighter.Haha, that's it."
1,服务和早餐都超好对小孩也特别照顾早餐时特别关心房间环境也不错值得推荐,"The service and breakfast are super good. For children, they are specially cared for the room environment when taking care of breakfast."
1,我在携程上订的是带电脑的商务房，结果给我安排了没电脑的商务房，不过后来还是给我换了带电脑的商务房。早餐的就餐环境和质量比以前有改进，但是早餐品种偏少，水果中的西瓜切块太大，希望有待改进！,"I booked a business house with a computer on Ctrip. As a result, I arranged me a business house without a computer, but later I changed me to a business house with a computer.The dining environment and quality of breakfast are improved than before, but there are fewer breakfast varieties, and the watermelon in the fruit is too large. I hope to improve it!"
1,前台服务员（特别是一个小伙子热情周到）态度不错，只是酒店装修中，有涂料气味不习惯。门童服务也不错。上次来时反映下面歌厅太吵，经说明后提供的房间不错，挺安静！,"The front desk waiter (especially a little guy enthusiastically and thoughtful) is good, but in the hotel decoration, the smell of paint is not used to the smell of paint.Men -child service is also good.The last time I came, it reflected that the following singing hall was too noisy."
1,交通很方便，服务态度不错，就是隔音条件不太好。,"The transportation is very convenient and the service attitude is good, that is, the sound insulation conditions are not good."
1,万豪是国际明牌酒店，前台服务总算合格、态度良好。然而可能是重庆的关系，这家房间质素非常一般而已，旧、小、设施普通。按这房价在重庆的CBD解放碑可以找到房间质素高很多，但价格要便宜多的。最值一提的是酒店大堂旁的西餐厅，中午自助餐可能由於没什么生意，食物新鲜度及服务员劣质的服务态度加上重庆顶级五星收费，会叫你马上决定别再考虑走进去。在重庆解放碑已住过好几家五星，建议若则重品牌的住客，相若的房价，选洲际会发现相差很远，物有所值。,"Marriott is an International Mingpai Hotel. The front desk service is finally qualified and good.However, it may be the relationship between Chongqing. The quality of this room is very general, and the old, small, and facilities are ordinary.According to the CBD liberated monument of this house price in Chongqing, the room can be found much higher, but the price is much cheaper.The most worth mentioning is the western restaurant next to the hotel lobby. At noon, the buffet may be because there is no business. The food freshness and the service attitude of the waiter and the service attitude of the waiter coupled with the top five -star charges of Chongqing. You will immediately decide not to consider going in.There are several five -star in the Chongqing Jiefangbei. It is recommended that if the residents of the brand are heavy, the same house prices will find that the intercontinental will find that the difference is far away and it is worth it."
1,这次到酒店就告知免费升级到套房，确实是一个惊喜．早餐比以前丰富些．房子隔音不太好，早晨外面卖菜的声音都听的很清楚（我在九楼）．,"This time I went to the hotel to inform the free upgrade to the suite, which is indeed a surprise.Breakfast is richer than before.The sound insulation of the house was not very good. The sound of selling vegetables outside in the morning was clear (I was on the ninth floor)."
1,酒店环境不错，挺安静的。服务也不错。推荐建德镇上的胖子新排挡，哪里的酸菜鱼不错,"The hotel environment is good and quiet.The service is also good.Recommend the new row of fat people in Jiande Town, where is the sauerkraut fish good?"
1,酒店很不错，住的B楼，蛮舒适的，服务也不错的。就是周围环境一般般。,The hotel is very good. The B -floor of the hotel is quite comfortable and the service is good.The surrounding environment is general.
1,前两天去住的时候正好是我的生日，酒店看到我的登记纪录特地为我做的生日蛋糕与水果盆送到我的房间里来，和我一起过生日，我一直出差在外面已经把自己的生日都快忘了，但酒店能安排这些为客人想到令我非常感动。补充点评2008年1月7日：就是卫生间有点小,"When I went to live two days ago, it was my birthday. The hotel saw my registration record specially made for my birthday cake and fruit basin to my room. I have a birthday with me. I have been on a business trip.I almost forgot my birthday, but the hotel can arrange these for the guests to think of me very much.Supplementary reviews January 7, 2008: The bathroom is a bit small"
1,这次住的是B座，价格同A座比起来也不算太贵，但是卫生条件，房间设施都很好。而且被子是我睡过的最舒服的,"This time I lived in Block B. The price is not too expensive than Block A, but the health conditions and the room facilities are very good.And the quilt is the most comfortable I have slept"
1,酒店的位置在一条坑坑洼洼的路旁，正好这两天下雨，基本上只能打车，走路很难，滨州的环境实话说都是很一般，房间大小一般，服务不错，我住的411，正好在雨蓬边上，基本上雨声不断，酒店的美女领班给我换了一间311，至少听不见雨声了。不过这个房间的窗户好像是摆设，打不开，看不到外面的。不过服务的态度不错！滨州也没有啥可选择的！,"The hotel is located on the side of a pothoral road. It happens that it is raining in the past two days. Basically, you can only take a taxi. It is difficult to walk. The environment in Binzhou is very average.On the side of the rain puff, the sound of rain was basically continuous. The beauty foreman of the hotel changed to me 311, at least I couldn't hear the sound of the rain.However, the window of this room seems to be furnishings, which cannot be opened, and cannot be seen outside.But the attitude of service is good!Binzhou has nothing to choose from!"
1,"确实很有商务型酒店的特点,但是缺乏周到的五星的服务.","It really has the characteristics of business hotels, but lacks thoughtful five -star service."
1,硬件环境尚可，但服务员的服务能力还有待进一步提高。对于携程网预订房间的处理能力需要加强,"The hardware environment is acceptable, but the service capability of the waiter needs to be further improved.The processing capacity of Ctrip's booking room needs to be strengthened"
1,"非常满意,房间和交通都不错,下次还要住该酒店了","Very satisfied, the room and traffic are good, I will stay in the hotel next time"
1,我是2008年8月8日入住这家酒店的。如果您是旅游，那么您可以把这家作为的首选。很有徽派特色。位置很好，就在屯溪老街，并且旁边就是一条滨江的路，晚上可以沿着江边散步，虽没有老街的喧嚣，但江边夜景也十分怡人。急需改进：1、餐厅的烹饪技术亟待提高，那个菜做的，是我吃过的最难以下咽的菜之一，尤其那道“胡氏一品锅”，看起来就没食欲。我是吃过正宗徽菜的，和这里完全两回事；2、房间的门真的不能再用钥匙了，用钥匙根本算不上是复古，这种钥匙的门，我们许久没用过，都不怎么会开了，建议更换感应式的门开关，关键是要方便客人。,"I stayed at this hotel on August 8, 2008.If you are traveling, then you can take this first choice.Very high -quality characteristics.The location is very good. It is on the old street of Tunxi, and there is a road of riverside next to it. You can take a walk along the river at night. Although there is no hustle and bustle of the old street, the night view of the river is also very pleasant.Urgently needed improvement: 1. The cooking technology of the restaurant needs to be improved. The dish is one of the most difficult dishes I have ever eaten. In particular, the ""Hu's Yipin Pot"" looks like no appetite.I have eaten authentic Hui cuisine, and it ’s completely two different things here; 2. The door of the room can really not use the key anymore. The key is not a retro at all.How can it be opened? It is recommended to replace the inductive door switch. The key is to facilitate guests."
1,房间挺舒服的，有保险箱、冰箱、体重仪。但是冰箱和体重仪坏了，另外我们住的那间房间门的安全插销没有了，最不好的就是酒店管理有问题，退房时说缺了毛巾，后来核实是他们没有放。好的是床垫是记忆的，很舒服。装修很漂亮，免费的东西也很多，早餐很丰盛，总体感觉不错。宾馆反馈2008年6月17日：首先感谢您对我们酒店提出的意见。冰箱有冷热两用功能，打开热开关能保温，打开冷开关是制冷。我们以热忱周到勤勉细致的服务恭候海内外宾客的光临!,"The room is very comfortable, including safe, refrigerators, and weight instruments.However, the refrigerator and the weight instrument were broken. In addition, the safety insertion of the room door we lived was gone. The worst was that there was a problem with the hotel management. When checking out, the towel was missing. Later, they were verified that they did not put it.The good thing is that the mattress is memory, which is very comfortable.The decoration is very beautiful, there are many free things, the breakfast is rich, and the overall feels good.Hotel feedback on June 17, 2008: First of all, thank you for your opinion on our hotel.The refrigerator has the functions of hot and cold. It can be kept on the heat and switch. It is refrigerated by turning on the cold switch.We are waiting for guests at home and abroad with enthusiasm and diligence!"
1,酒店就在新世纪旁边，有网线，非常方便，房间很大，服务，设施都还行，比在贵阳住的三星好得多。,"The hotel is next to the new century. There are network cables. It is very convenient. The room is large, the service, and the facilities are OK, which is much better than Samsung living in Guiyang."
1,很舒适的酒店，软硬设施都不错。交通也比较方便，就是周围吃饭的地方不太多，还好离SM广场满近的。酒店还给通过携程入住的旅客送上了一个毛巾礼盒，呵呵，有点意外的惊喜~~~,"Very comfortable hotels, soft and hard facilities are good.Transportation is also more convenient, that is, there are not many places to eat around, but it is full of closer to SM Square.The hotel also gave a towel box to the passengers who stayed in Ctrip. Hehe, a little surprised surprise ~~~"
1,房间不错，但没想到酒店前面正在修路，所以非常不方便。,"The room was good, but I did not expect to build a road in front of the hotel, so it was very inconvenient."
1,"入住的时候礼宾在哪里?房间里的花盆特别象90年代初期的田园花盆,极为难看.更可怕的是入住的时候门口不管客人,照常做大范围清洁.",Where is the ritual at the time of staying? The flower pots in the room are especially like the rural flower pot in the early 1990s. It is extremely ugly. The more terrible is that the door is cleaned as usual regardless of the guests at the door.
1,携程上是四星，宾馆本部写的是五星。不过无所谓啦，住了两个晚上，一家人都蛮舒服的。用具齐备，环境尚可，早餐比较丰盛。酒店位置离旅游区域屯溪老街2分钟车程，10分钟脚程（已亲历证实--）。不过当我回来发现一根小丝巾忘在那里，打电话去问得时候，虽然告诉我确实在房间里有丝巾，不过说邮费很贵，要我出。这事做得好没腔调。我只好麻烦在黄山的朋友去帮我拿一下，等以后他来上海再带给我。,"Ctrip is four stars, and the hotel headquarters wrote five stars.But it doesn't matter. After two nights, the family was quite comfortable.The utensils are available, the environment is acceptable, and the breakfast is relatively abundant.The hotel location is a 2-minute drive from the tourist area Tunxi Old Street, and 10 minutes (has been confirmed by person-).However, when I came back and found a small silk scarf to forget there, when I called and asked, although I told me that there was really a silk scarf in the room, it was said that the postage was expensive and asked me to go out.This is a good job.I had to trouble my friends in Huangshan to help me get it, and he would bring me to me when he came to Shanghai later."
1,酒店的设施非常令人满意，前台及停车场的服务员态度均非常让人满意，下次来黄山肯定再住此处，但房间的下水道好像有些不通，厕所内有很臭的味道，是从马桶里返上来的，希望酒店能解决。,"The hotel's facilities are very satisfactory. The attitude of the waiter in the front desk and the parking lot is very satisfactory. Next time I come to Huangshan to live here, but the sewer in the room seems to be a bit unreasonable.Back in, I hope the hotel can solve it."
1,总体上还是不错的。但是也有不足之处：1）房间的暖气太足了，实在吃不消；2）单间没有专门放置电脑的地方，电源插座离桌子太远，不大方便；3）早餐的水果实在是少得可怜；4）刷卡的机器老出问题，害得我都担心会不会被重刷，另外，服务生居然当时不给我取消预收权，说过段时间自动会取消，害我担心了一阵。,"Overall it is good.However, there are also shortcomings: 1) The heating of the room is too sufficient, and it is really unbearable; 2) There is no place where the computer is specifically placed in a single room, and the power socket is too far away from the table, which is not convenient;4) When the machine of swiping the card is always wrong, I am worried that I will be re -swiping. In addition, the waiter did not cancel me at the time. I said that it would be canceled automatically after a period of time, which hurt me for a while."
1,酒店是不错，服务也好，但感觉五星的评级有点过了。。。估计国家旅游局的这种星级评定人为主观的因素还是占相当的成分。总体来说，值得推荐。,"The hotel is good and the service is good, but the five -star rating is a bit over.EssenceEssenceIt is estimated that the subjective factors of the State Administration of Tourism are still considerable.Overall, it is worth recommending."
1,非常满意酒店的服务，做得很细心，比其它酒店好多了，以后还会再住在此酒店，谢谢携程的工作人员帮忙让我们过得很愉快，在此要特别感谢酒店在3月28号这天对我们的最贴心服务，因这天是我们的大喜日子，早上从外面拍完照片回来我的拖尾婚纱太长了搞的很dirty，打电话叫他们帮加急洗，后来帮我洗得很快很干净地送回来还free，非常感动，再次谢谢他们的工作人员，该酒店各方面都很好，唯一的遗憾就是大堂的酒吧，东西很少，想要喝的东西都没有，坐那里都没有意思，希望下次他们能改进，不要总是写满在酒水单上让人看什么都有，事实上都没有供应，,"I am very satisfied with the service of the hotel, and I am very careful. It is much better than other hotels. I will live in this hotel again in the future. Thank you Ctrip's staff for helping us for helping us live well. Here I would like to thank the hotel for March 28th, March 28thThis day's most intimate service for us, because this day is our great day. After taking a picture from the outside, I came back to my trailer wedding dress too long.Wash it quickly and send it back and get free. It is very moved. Thank you again for their staff. The hotel is very good in all aspects. The only regret is the lobby bar. There are very few things. There is nothing you want to drink.It is not interesting to sit there. I hope they can improve it next time. Don't always write on the drink list to make people see everything. In fact, there is no supply."
1,位置离火车站有一段距离，该酒店服务还可以，就是入住时才发现窗外在施工，晚上大约23：00才停止，有点吵。另外卫生间有点小，早餐一般，,"The location is a distance from the railway station. The hotel service is okay. It is only when the window is found to be construction at the time of check -in. It stops at about 23:00 in the evening. It is a bit noisy.In addition, the bathroom is a bit small, breakfast is average,"
1,整体环境还可以，离亚龙湾比较近。但近期一直在装修，一楼凌乱，给人感觉不太舒服。价格偏高。服务一般。,"The overall environment is okay, closer to Yalong Bay.But I have been renovating recently. The first floor is messy, which feels not comfortable.The price is high.The service is average."
1,喜欢阳光海滩，所以三亚一向是我度假的首选。第一次住致远，以前没注意过这家酒店，因为它在携程推荐中排得比较后。这次是春节的缘故，订不到酒店，才找到了致远。和大家分享一下自己的感受：1．接机的服务很好，司机敬业。我的飞机晚了两个多小时，司机一直等在那里。我以前住的其他酒店没有这项服务。如果有送机就更好了。事实上车去接客都是空车去，可以顺便搭载要去机场的旅客；2．酒店没有电梯，行李多会比较麻烦，不过酒店安排了保安帮客人拿行李，不用小费；3．正如前面的驴友分享的，酒店有分新旧不同的房间（大堂主楼的部分是新装修的），最好能订新装修的，感觉差很多。我之前订的是还没有重装的房间，看了以后不喜欢，没想到向酒店经理一反映，正好有空的新房，马上帮我换了房。觉得物超所值；4．房间不能上网，有些不大方便。还好大堂能上，免费的；5．餐厅的价位还算合理，菜的口味也不错。看了很多驴友都推荐去春园吃海鲜，我也去试了，两个字：后悔！那就是一个大排档，感觉海鲜是便宜了点，但那么好的海鲜给大排挡一做，鲜味都没有了。所以我是不会再去了。6．酒店的自助早餐不贵，但每天都一样，应该多些变化。如果有选择的话，不要在过年前后来三亚，所有的东西都超贵，商家就抓住这个机会痛宰旅客。说实在的，和我去过的其他旅游城市比起来，三亚不少地方的商业道德要差很多，希望下回再来三亚可以不留遗憾吧。,"I like Sunshine Beach, so Sanya has always been the first choice for my vacation.For the first time, I didn't notice this hotel before, because it ranked after Ctrip's recommendation.This time was the Spring Festival, and I couldn't find the hotel before I found Zhiyuan.Share with you your feelings: 1.The service of the pick -up is very good, and the driver is dedicated.My plane was more than two hours later, and the driver was waiting there.Other hotels I used to stay did not have this service.It would be better if there is a sending machine.In fact, the car to pick up the passengers is empty cars.The hotel does not have an elevator, and the luggage will be more troublesome, but the hotel arranges a security guard to help the guests get the luggage without tip;Just as the donkey friends shared, the hotel has different rooms of new and old (the part of the main building of the lobby is newly renovated). It is best to order new decoration. It feels much worse.I have booked a room that I have n’t reinstalled before. I did n’t like it after watching it. I did n’t expect to reflect to the hotel manager. I just replaced the room for a new house when I was free.I think it is worth it;The room cannot access the Internet, which is not convenient.Fortunately, the lobby can be free; 5.The price of the restaurant is quite reasonable, and the taste of the dishes is also good.After watching a lot of donkey friends, I recommend going to Chunyuan to eat seafood. I also try it, two words: regret!That is a large stall. It feels that seafood is a bit cheaper, but so good seafood gives the large -scale gear, and the umami taste is gone.So I won't go again.6.The hotel's buffet breakfast is not expensive, but every day is the same, it should change more.If you have a choice, do n’t have to be expensive in Sanya before and after the Chinese New Year, and the merchant seize this opportunity to slaughter the passengers.To be honest, compared with other tourist cities I have been to, many places in Sanya are much worse. I hope that next time I come to Sanya to leave without regrets."
1,服务方面细节考虑比较好，特别是在酒店入住后服务员会给你送来水果。虽然水果不值多少钱，但是给客人的感觉比较好。,"The service details are considered better, especially after the hotel check -in, the waiter will send you fruit.Although the fruit is not worth it, it feels better for guests."
1,卫生很好，早餐一般，不过很便宜，只有15元。房间内拖鞋质量太差。餐厅提供的菜肴味道不错。,"Hygiene is very good, breakfast is average, but it is very cheap, only 15 yuan.The quality of slippers in the room is too poor.The dishes provided by the restaurant have a good taste."
1,多次入住温特莱酒店，感觉服务明显有了提高，而且楼层的设施也在不断的改进，前段时间提出的要求，这次入住明显看到了效果，而且酒店的2层书吧非常好，尤其酒店的金钥匙服务非常热情，在酒店期间，帮助我解决了很多的困难，真的挺感谢他们的，酒店的大堂增加了4幅油画，很有气派，感觉特别好。值得一提的是，入住时，正巧赶上我的生日，一进房间就看到了酒店免费赠送的生日蛋糕与祝福，挺温馨的。,"Masting many times in the Wintele Hotel, I feel that the service has obviously improved, and the facilities of the floor are constantly improving. The requirements put forward some time ago, this time I saw the effect obviously, and the hotel's 2 -floor book bar is very good, especially in particular, especiallyThe hotel's golden key service is very enthusiastic. During the hotel, I helped me solve a lot of difficulties. I really thanked them. The lobby of the hotel added 4 oil paintings. It was very elegant and felt particularly good.It is worth mentioning that when I stayed in, I happened to catch up with my birthday. As soon as I entered the room, I saw the hotel's free birthday cake and blessing, which was very warm."
1,酒店有些老，设施一般，早餐一般。位置位于火车站附近，但是周边环境有些乱。,"The hotel is old, the facilities are average, and the breakfast is average.The location is located near the railway station, but the surrounding environment is a bit chaotic."
1,"入住时酒店安排在一个看起来跟我生日有些联系的房间，如果是刻意的，我很喜欢。不满意的是房间有一支四角朝天的“小强""躺在电视机旁的地上4天也没人为它送葬，很让人不舒服。大堂结帐时始终是忙乱的，大概他们自己没感觉。工作人员从前台客户旁边走过走员工通道没有任何问候用语，很别扭。这次不能给高分，算是一种激励吧。","When staying, the hotel arranged in a room that seemed to be connected with me. If it was deliberate, I liked it very much.What is not satisfied is that there is a four -corner ""Xiaoqiang"" lying on the ground next to the TV for 4 days and no one sends it to it. It is very uncomfortable.The lobby was always busy at checkout, probably they didn't feel it.The staff walked through the staff channel from the front desk, there was no greeting language, it was awkward.Can't give high scores this time, it is a kind of motivation."
1,总体感觉不错，作为休闲度假还是很好的选择，度假山庄的环境很好，但是携程提供的选择太少了，只有标双，实际上就对应山庄里面最差的一种房型（A开头的），事实上还有B和C区，房间会好很多，特别是C区，还有临湖的私家草坪可以用，建议携程以后提供另外两种房型供选择，要不就只好直接找酒店区订了。另外携程在自由行攻略方面写的针对性不够，太多肇庆市的东西，对山庄的介绍太少了，我们去了才发现有南门和西门，南门进去的做船的时间较长，而且返程的船比较少，很不方便，而西门就方便很多，可是我们进去才发现，但车已经停在南门了，所以比较郁闷。特别要提的是，山庄的摆渡船发动机的声音实在是太大了，所以，坐船绝对不是享受。吃饭方面，就像前面有人说的，价格偏贵但味道不错。服务方面，客房服务相对差一点，其他（例如：接待、船务、餐厅、表演等）的服务态度很好。最后想提下停车费的问题，不过夜5元，过夜20元，觉得不太容易理解，照道理住宿了停车费应该优惠或者免费嘛，结果更贵。。罗嗦了一大通，就到这里吧，还是要说一下，景点风景还是非常优美的：）,"Overall feels good. As a leisure vacation, it is still a good choice. The environment of the holiday villa is very good, but the choice provided by Ctrip is too small. Only the standard doubles, in fact, correspond to the worst room type in the villa (starting with A)In fact, there are regions B and C. The rooms will be much better, especially in area C, and private lawns in Linhu can be used. It is recommended that Ctrip provided two other types of room types to choose from.It's right.In addition, Ctrip has not been targeted enough in terms of free travel strategy. Too many things in Zhaoqing City, there are too few introduction to the villa. We only found that there are South Gate and Ximen.And there are fewer boats, which are very inconvenient, and Simon is much more convenient, but we only found out that the car had stopped at the south gate, so it was more depressed.In particular, the sound of the ferry engine of the villa is too loud, so the boat is definitely not enjoyable.In terms of eating, as some people said before, the price is expensive but tastes good.In terms of services, room services are relatively poor, other services (such as reception, shipping, restaurants, performances, etc.) are very good.Finally, I want to raise the problem of parking fees, but at 5 yuan at night, 20 yuan overnight, I feel that it is not easy to understand. It should be preferential or free after accommodation in Taoism. The result is more expensive.EssenceIt ’s a lot of communication, so here, let’ s talk about it, the scenic spot is still very beautiful :)"
1,"由于假日又要收早餐费又要收宽带费,所以选了这个酒店,感觉还是可以的","Because the breakfast fee is required on holidays and the broadband fee is required, I chose this hotel, and it feels that it is okay"
1,"过年回家时在这里住了一晚,离北站非常近.屋子比较大,设施还可以.早餐种类比价多,但是做得更精致点就更好了.总体感觉还不错.","I stayed here for one night when I went home in the New Year, and it was very close to the North Station. The house was relatively large, and the facilities were okay. The types of breakfast were more than the price, but it was better to do more delicately. The overall feeling is not bad."
1,如果按3星级的标准，绝对比北京的3星要货真价实的多，性价比很高。开始我以为198元也只能住个学校招待所的标准，但没想到的是环境还是很好的，朋友也都很满意。早点北方人会觉得一般，卫生还是很好的，我住的屋子空调是有些声音的，就像排风扇。洗浴的开关是相反的！总之这次旅行住的还是很舒服的！结算时应该比以前快了，说明他们是有进步的，鼓励一下吧！希望他们保持住并给我们更多的优惠和服务，我们会经常光顾的！,"If according to the standard of 3 -star, it is definitely more real than Beijing's 3 -star, and the cost performance is high.At the beginning, I thought that 198 yuan could only live in the standard of a school hostel, but what I did not expect was that the environment was still very good, and friends were very satisfied.Early northerners will feel that it is general, hygiene is still very good. The air conditioning of the house I live in is like a fan.The bath switch is the opposite!In short, this trip is still very comfortable!It should be faster than before, indicating that they are progressive, let's encourage it!I hope they keep and give us more discounts and services, we will often patronize!"
1,"很有温馨感,价格也不错.行政房的服务好,酒店管理有水准.","Very warm, the price is good. The service of the administrative house is good, and the hotel management is standardized."
1,房间很大，大的让我去其他宾馆都感觉性价比不高！服务也不错，值得一住！！,"The room is very large, so I feel that it is not cost -effective to go to other hotels!The service is also good, it is worth living!Intersection"
1,"首先我说说洗手间的问题,之前看了网友说这里的卫生间很小不太留意,可是去到才真的发现卫生间真的太小了,我们住的是标双,卫生间大概只有2-3平方的样子,而厨房其实是没有用的,真的不知道建筑师是怎么设计的.花洒就在马桶的上面,转个身就会碰到马桶,洗澡要想马桶不湿简直是天方夜谈了!!然后就是关于房间的价格,156","First of all, I talked about the problem in the bathroom. I saw that the netizens said that the bathroom here did not pay much attention, but I really found that the bathroom was really too small. We lived in the bidding double.The appearance, and the kitchen is actually useless. I really don’t know how the architect designed. The shower is just on the toilet. When turning, you will touch the toilet. If you want to take a bath, you want to do the toilet.It's about the price of the room, 156, 156"
1,非常别致的一家酒店，设计很独特。地理位置有点偏，但酒店有班车也挺方便的。下次还会住。很喜欢：―）,"A very chic hotel with a unique design.The geographical location is a bit biased, but the hotel is also very convenient to have a bus.I will live next time.like very much:-)"
1,我7月24号入住瑞豪酒店，开始有些不顺利，但是那里的管理还是非常好的，有位姓赵的经理发现问题后（他是负责携程客户的），马上就解决了，呵呵，还是要感谢他。进了房间以后，房子超大，还配备了电脑，空调好像超凉，感觉酒店还是挺适合出差公干的。,"I stayed at the Ruihao Hotel on July 24th and started to be a bit unsuccessful, but the management there was still very good. After a manager named Zhao found the problem (he was responsible for Ctrip's customers), it was resolved immediately, huh, or it, or it, orThanks to him.After entering the room, the house was very large, and it was equipped with a computer. The air conditioner seemed to be super cool. It felt that the hotel was still suitable for business trips."
1,服务较好，环境也不错，但出行打车不是很方便，在酒店门口很难叫到车，很多时候要走到大街上去等。,"The service is good and the environment is good, but it is not convenient to travel and take a taxi. It is difficult to call the car at the door of the hotel."
1,一家不错的特色度假酒店，到处充满的茶文化，什么茶壶，茶经琳琅满目，估计现在是旅游的旺季，前两个星期就开始预订酒店了。但周末一直被告知订满了，也不知道是真是假，终于搞订。周末带着老婆出发。刚进酒店才就发现酒店生意真的是很好，总台办理入住的人太多，等了好久才轮到，在总台办理入住时，总台的服务员很热情，态度也不错。后被告知之酒店现在周末预订的话最好是提前二周时间预订。终于入住房间。房间不是很大，但是个大床间，床是大的可以了，估计有二米，卫生间小了一点，但配置还是蛮全的。房间整体还是很整洁的舒适的，茶几上还有水果，这到是个惊喜。看了房间里的说明才了解，陆羽山庄是中国首家以茶文化为主题的度假酒店。怪不得连房间里也布置了茶壶呢。下午去酒店边上的双溪漂流玩了一下，还不错就是人多的可以。回酒店后去了游泳池，酒店的泳池真是的不错。是室内外的，边上的环境也不错身边到处是绿色的世界，游完泳又玩了酒店的沙弧球、台球，没想到酒店不大康乐配备还是挺全的。晚上准备用餐，走过大堂，遇见酒店早上办理入住的大堂副理，听说我们要去用餐了，介绍酒店的中餐特色是以土菜新做，而且也是很实惠的。看在酒店服务这么殷切的份上和老婆商量去试一下。到餐厅后，发现餐厅是以陆羽的名字命名的，菜肴很有特色，服务员介绍了，小溪渔，特色鸭口味都不错。后来我和老婆两个人吃了一百五十元不到，便宜的让人不相信这是在五星级的酒店用餐。吃过晚饭，和老婆在酒店的外围逛了一圈，才发现中午来的时候的那股热浪早已被山间的绿色消耗殆尽，凉风吹来很是舒服。酒店的外围是以别墅形式的客房，询问后得知酒店别墅有六个房间，下次决定带朋友们一起来度个假。享受一下别墅生活，好好奢侈一把。,"A good special resort hotel, full of tea culture everywhere, what teapot, tea is full of tea. It is estimated that it is the peak season for tourism.But the weekend has been told that it is full, and I do n’t know if it is true or not, and I finally set up.Start with his wife on the weekend.I found that the hotel business was really good as soon as I entered the hotel. There were too many people in the main station to check in. After waiting for a long time, it was my turn. When I handled it in the head station, the waiter of the main station was very enthusiastic and good.After being told that the hotel is reservation on weekends, it is best to book two weeks in advance.Finally stay in the room.The room is not very large, but in a large bed, the bed is large. It is estimated that there are two meters. The bathroom is a little smaller, but the configuration is quite complete.The overall room is still very neat and comfortable. There are fruits on the coffee table, which is a surprise.After reading the instructions in the room, Lu Yu Villa is the first resort hotel in China with the theme of tea culture.No wonder even a teapot is arranged in the room.In the afternoon, I went to Shuangxi Drifting on the side of the hotel to play with it. It was pretty good.After returning to the hotel, I went to the swimming pool. The hotel's pool was really good.It is indoor and outdoor, and the environment on the side is also a green world around you. After swimming, you have played the hotel's sand arc balls and billiards. I did not expect that the hotel was not well -equipped.In the evening, I prepared for dining, walked through the lobby, and met the deputy manager of the lobby in the morning in the hotel in the morning. I heard that we are going to dine. Introduce the Chinese food characteristics of the hotel is made of new native vegetables, and it is also very affordable.Look at the hotel service such an ardent and discuss with your wife to try it.After arriving at the restaurant, I found that the restaurant was named after Lu Yu. The dishes were very distinctive. The waiter introduced it, the creek fishing, the special duck taste is good.Later, my wife and I ate less than one hundred and fifty yuan. The cheap one made people believe that it was a five -star hotel.After dinner, I went around with my wife at the periphery of the hotel, only to find that the heat wave when I came at noon had been exhausted by the green of the mountain, and the cool wind was very comfortable.The periphery of the hotel is in the form of a villa. After asking, I learned that there are six rooms in the hotel villa. The next time I decided to take friends to take a vacation together.Enjoy the life of the villa and be extravagant."
1,一家相当不错的度假酒店，环境一流，看得出来现在是旺季，客人满满，前台办理入住登记没有网上说的那么离谱啦，还是比较快的~~大堂是很古典的那种，酒店内随处可见摆设的茶壶及茶经，不经意间发现酒店的房间和餐厅包厢的名字都是以茶叶的名字命名的，酒店大堂外面还有一块茶园，询问之下才得知是这边特有的径山茶，酒店茶文化气息还是比较浓的，个人比较喜欢大堂至客房的走廊，明亮安静，还可以欣赏酒店的庭院景色。~~房间还OK啦，没有网上说的那么小，很干净，窗外景观也很好，可以看到酒店引进的溪水及山景，房间的宽带也是免费使用的~~中餐厅的菜值得推荐，大多都是当地的特色农家菜，味道不错哦，更重要的是价格也适中啦~~度假酒店泳池应该是最有吸引力的吧，当然这里没有让我失望哦，哈哈。。。室外内都有。。。不错不错~~,"A pretty good resort hotel with first -class environment. It can be seen that it is the peak season. The guests are full.It can be seen that the teapot and tea scriptures are seen inadvertently that the names of the hotel's rooms and restaurant boxes are named after the name of tea. There is also a tea garden outside the hotel lobby.The hotel's tea culture is still relatively strong. I personally prefer the lobby to the corridor of the guest room. It is bright and quiet, and you can also enjoy the hotel's courtyard scenery.~~ The room is still ok. It is not as small as online, very clean, and the landscape outside the window is also very good. You can see the streams and mountains introduced by the hotel. The broadband of the room is also used for free.Most of them are local characteristic farm foods. It tastes good. More importantly, the price is moderate ~~ The resort hotel swimming pool should be the most attractive. Of course, it is not disappointed here, haha.EssenceEssenceThere are outdoor.EssenceEssenceNot bad ~~"
1,看网上评论，褒贬不一，有点但心。入住后觉得是非常不错的酒店。房间不错，卫生间没有点评的那么差，很干净，就是稍小了一些。服务很体贴，停在外面的车酒店会加上遮阳板。泳池很棒，可惜蚊子太多了，建议安装灭蚊器。,"Looking at the online comments, there are different kindness, a little bit of heart.After check -in, I think it is a very good hotel.The room is good, and the bathroom is not as bad as comments. It is very clean, but it is slightly smaller.The service is very considerate.The swimming pool is great, but unfortunately there are too many mosquitoes. It is recommended to install mosquito wares."
1,大堂、过道、房间都不错，但卫生间实在与挂牌五星不符，没有独立的淋浴房，只有浴缸配浴帘，作为一个新建的酒店相当落伍。整个山庄感觉类似于一个别墅住宅小区，环境还不错，但也没什么过人之处。早餐偏中式的，品种不多，一般般，五一期间，客人太多，要找个位置都不容易。去用晚餐就被告知没位子了。临安安吉这一带好的酒店少得可怜，陆羽山庄似乎只能是不二的选择了。,"The lobby, aisle, and rooms are good, but the bathroom is really inconsistent with the listing five -star. There is no independent shower room. There is only a bathtub with a shower curtain. It is quite outdated as a new hotel.The entire villa feels similar to a villa residential area. The environment is not bad, but there is nothing extraordinary.Breakfast is Chinese, there are not many varieties. Generally, during the May Day, there are too many guests, and it is not easy to find a place.Go to dinner and be informed that there is no seat.The good hotels in Lin'anji are poor, and Lu Yu Villa seems to be the best choice."
1,应该说是一家相当不错的度假酒店，好的方面不多说了，说些不足之处吧：1、想去游泳，但室内恒温泳池对住店客人也要收费，第一次碰到，坚决抵制，愤然离去！2、自助早餐餐厅偏小，服务跟不上（或者不愿跟上），都是等你全部吃完才肯收盘子，找不到刀叉，得问服务员要！3、悠闲度假的功能没有能充分发挥出来，康体设施的收费偏贵（比如自行车是半小时30元），利用率不高。,"It should be said that it is a pretty good resort hotel. I do n’t say much about good aspects. Let ’s say something: 1. I want to go swimming, but the indoor constant temperature swimming pool also needs to charge the guests.Resist, leave angrily!2. The buffet breakfast restaurant is small, and the service cannot keep up (or unwilling to keep up). It is all waiting for you to finish all the time. If you can't find the knife and fork, you have to ask the waiter!3. The function of leisurely vacation can be fully played. The charges of Kangthe facilities are expensive (such as the bicycle is 30 yuan for half an hour), and the utilization rate is not high."
1,"简直太失望了，陆羽还是中国75个顶级度假村之一，感觉除了环境还不错，其他一切都另人失望至极。1.入住酒店第一天晚上在陆羽厅吃的晚饭，点了几个菜，其他不多说，就说说香椿炒蛋，鸡蛋炒出来是灰色的，新鲜不新鲜先不做评论，但香椿实在太少了，数的出的几片香椿叶子，实在难以忍受，建议此菜名改为蛋炒香椿。另外，还叫了罗宋汤，OHMYGOD,简直令人惊讶不已，能照得出人影的烫里漂浮着四片薄薄的番茄和5小块洋葱丁，用汤勺捞了又捞，其他啥也没有，建议改菜名叫番茄洋葱清汤比较合适，叫来服务员小姐问话，答曰：罗宋汤就是这样的，接着就转身不理我们了。无语………………2.就餐的时候还有几个苍蝇一直骚扰我们，服务员像是没看到一样，倒茶也是要自己起身去拿水壶倒的。3.洗脸的水池也是坏的，打电话叫来工程部大约10分钟才来人，最终修好了。4.顶级度假村，竟然不送水果，真是稀奇。或许我是井底蛙了。5.服务人员素质不配套，路过时也不打招呼，把头歪向一边，就像没看到客人一样，客人又不是老虎，至于嘛？6.还要说一说令人无法忍耐的早餐，品种太少，数得出的几个菜还不好吃，芋头是馊掉的，粥是可以看到人影的，实在太清了，而且米水分离，感觉像泡饭。水果只有一种，那就是西瓜。最后一天好一点，总算还加了一个水果（黑布林）。7.定的是商务单间大床房，结果发现原来所谓的大床房就是两张单人床拼在一起的。8.别的不多说了，最令人无法忍受的就是退房。规定12点退房，结果11：45分酒店打来电话询问是否续住，答曰不续住（我们就是住大街上也不住你这了），马上来办理退房手续。过了10分钟（12点差5分）我和老公正提着行李往门口走，电话又来催了，问何时办理CHECKOUT，，，当时我已经要骂人了，，催命啊？有这么催的吗？？？值得一提的是酒店外面的农家菜饭店里的菜非常好吃，又便宜，值得一试。综上所述，建议酒店老板好好制定一个计划来培训人员素质，包括厨房。这样才不会流失客源。宾馆反馈2008年3月21日：首先我们感谢您对酒店提出的宝贵意见，酒店管理层非常重视客人的每一条意见和建议，对于您所提出的一系列问题，酒店也作了相应的整改。餐饮尽量做到“新、鲜、多”（新菜出的快、口味鲜美、品种多样），让客人尝到不同口味的菜肴，并推出养生营养系列菜，希望您有时间能再次光临酒店品尝，再次提出好的建议。酒店多次组织全体员工进行礼节礼貌、服务意识、知识培训、技能培训、态度培训、习惯潜能培训，通过培训提高员工工作所需的意识、技能、知识和观念酒店，提高了服务员的主动服务意识，并确保提供给客人的产品均是安全可用、舒适温馨的，给客人家的","It was too disappointed. Lu Yu was one of the 75 top resorts in China. It felt like that except for the environment is not bad, everything else was extremely disappointed.1. Check in the dinner where the hotel ate in Lu Yu Hall on the first night. I ordered a few dishes. If you do n’t say much, you can say that the toon scrambled eggs. The eggs are fried.There are too few, and the number of toon leaves are unbearable. It is recommended that the name of this dish is changed to egg scrambled toon.In addition, I also called Lodong soup, Ohmygod, which was surprising. It was able to take care of the shadow of four thin tomatoes and 5 small pieces of diced onion.No, it is recommended to change the name of the tomato onion and clear soup. It is more appropriate to call the waiter Miss and answer: The Lord Song Tang is like this, and then turn around and ignore us.Speechless .......... 2. There are still a few flies that have been harassed when eating. The waiter seems to have not seen it. Pour tea and get up to pick up the kettle.3. The facial washing pool was also bad. Calling the engineering department for about 10 minutes to come, and it was finally repaired.4. The top resort, it is unusual to not give the fruit without sending fruits.Maybe I'm a frog at the bottom of the well.5. The quality of the service personnel is not equipped, and they do not say hello when they pass by. They tilted their heads aside. Just like they did not see the guests, the guests were not tigers. As for?6. Also talk about the unbearable breakfast. There are too few varieties. The number of dishes that are drawn are not delicious. The taro is squeezed. The porridge can be seen.Rice water is separated, it feels like brewing rice.There is only one fruit, that is watermelon.The last day was better, and finally a fruit (Heblin) was added.7. It is determined that the business single -room and large bed room, but it was found that the original so -called large bed room was fighting together with two single beds.8. Not much to say, the most intolerable thing is to check out.It is required to check out at 12 o'clock. As a result, the hotel called at 11:45 to ask if it was renewed, and answered that we would not continue (we just live on the street and can't live in you), and immediately go through check -out procedures.After 10 minutes (5 o'clock, 5 o'clock), my husband and I were walking to the door with luggage, and the phone came to urge again. Ask when to do Checkout. I was already scolding people at the time, urging my life?Is it so urged?IntersectionIntersectionIt is worth mentioning that the dishes in the farmhouse restaurant outside the hotel are very delicious, cheap, and worth trying.In summary, it is recommended that the hotel owner formulate a plan to train the quality of the trainer, including the kitchen.This will not lose the source of customers.Hotel feedback on March 21, 2008: First of all, we thank you for your valuable opinions on the hotel. The hotel management attaches great importance to every opinion and suggestion of the guests. The hotel has also made corresponding rectifications for a series of issues you put forward.Try to be ""new, fresh, more"" (fast, delicious, variety of new dishes), so that guests can taste different flavors of dishes, and launch a series of dishes in health and nutritious. I hope you can visit the hotel again to taste it again., Reorganize good suggestions again.The hotel has organized all employees to carry out politeness, service awareness, knowledge training, skills training, attitude training, habitual potential training, and improve the consciousness, skills, knowledge and concept hotels needed by training.And ensure that the products provided to the guests are safe, comfortable and warm, for guests' house"
1,"一般情况下我不会对酒店评价，但这个酒店实在是需要点评一下，非常不满意。主要有以下情况：1.前台给我的房间是D座，从前台到客房走了5分多钟，对于5星级实在不敢恭维。2.进入客房非常冷，打开空调半个小时左右才热起来。3.空调声音巨大，晚上开空调睡不着，不开又冷，只能凑合了。4.5星饭店居然没有电熨斗和熨衣板，我也懒得和客房要，实在说不过去。5.饭店里居然没有ATM机。6.饭店门口没有出租车，到大门等的话，由于此饭店在鄂尔多斯市郊，打车很难。7.客房的冰箱里居然连付费的饮料都没有，但有个饮料单，呵呵。8.卫生间居然没有浴缸，倒不是一定要泡澡，但5星的标准实在值得怀疑。9.淋浴室的角落都是脏的，很难想象发生过什么，呵呵。10.没有看到饭店服务介绍的资料，只有一个点评单，我都懒得评了，实在没什么可说的。总的说，饭店的硬件还OK,服务人员的服务还可以，但小的问题太多，性价比实在太低。希望改进。改进前我是不会再住此饭店了。","Under normal circumstances, I will not evaluate the hotel, but this hotel really needs to be reviewed, and I am very dissatisfied.There are mainly the following situations: 1. The front desk for me is Block D. I walked from the front desk to the guest room for more than 5 minutes. I dare not compliment the 5 -star.2. It is very cold to enter the guest room. It turns on the air conditioner for about half an hour before heating.3. The sound of air -conditioning is huge, and the air conditioner can't sleep at night. It can only be made up.4.5 Star Hotel has no electric iron and ironing board, and I am too lazy to ask the guest room. I can't say it.5. There is no ATM machine in the restaurant.6. There is no taxi at the door of the hotel. If you go to the gate, etc., it is difficult to take a taxi because the hotel is on the outskirts of Ordos.7. There is no paid drink in the refrigerator of the guest room, but there is a drink list, haha.8. There is no bathtub in the bathroom. It is not necessary to take a bath, but the standard of 5 stars is really doubtful.9. The corners of the shower room are dirty, and it is difficult to imagine what happened, haha.10. I did n’t see the information about the hotel service introduction. There was only one review list. I was too lazy to comment. There was nothing to say.Generally speaking, the hardware of the hotel is OK, the service staff is okay, but there are too many problems, and the cost -effectiveness is too low.Hope to improve.Before I improve, I will not live in this restaurant anymore."
1,以酒店所在的东胜区（鄂尔多斯市首府）来说，酒店离有一定的距离，从汽车站出来上了一辆出租车，司机不知道假日酒店所在，后来找到了发现正门上写着鄂尔多斯国宾馆，之后再打车就会跟司机说去国宾馆而不说去假日酒店。酒店的环境不错，商务房间的设计和舒适程度也很好。大部分的工作人员也很专业，笑容可掬。酒店里自助晚餐的出品值得一赞。有一晚住的标间，给安排的房间里有设施已损坏：镜子破裂，镜前灯坏，卫生间内没有合适的挂毛巾的地方（被告知整个第4座里的标间设计皆如此！），淋浴头的支撑已坏，来查看的工作人员连正确的把淋浴头放到支撑上都不会，还穿着鞋踩在雪白的地巾上留下一个黑鞋印。,"For the hotel where the hotel is located (the capital of Ordos), the hotel has a certain distance from the hotel. He came out of a taxi from the bus station. The driver did not know the holiday hotel. LaterThe hotel, after taking a taxi, I will tell the driver to go to the hotel without talking to the holiday hotel.The hotel's environment is good, and the design and comfort of business rooms are also very good.Most of the staff are also very professional and smile.The production of buffet dinner in the hotel is worthy of praise.One night's living room, the facilities in the arranged room have been damaged: the mirror is broken, the front lights of the mirror are broken, and there are no suitable towels in the bathroom (the design of the standard room in the 4th seat is the case!)The support of the shower head is bad. The staff who came to view would not even put the shower head on the support correctly. They also walked on the white scarf and left a black shoe print on the white scarf."
1,第一次入住该酒店，一进店就感觉很舒服，他们的服务很周到．我是自己开车去旅游的，晚上２１：００点多才到，进店到前台一报名字，前台的服务人员就很热情，问我开了这么就的车，一定很累了，饭吃了没有？他们的销售人员下预定单的时候就交代了她们，我晚上会到．并且交代我是自己开车来得，到了一定很累，让她们尽快的安排入住．她们的这种服务让我感到很温馨，有回家的感觉．客房很干净，早餐也很不错，特别值得一赞的是酒店的客房有免费提供拨打国内长途电话、水果、免费品武夷山岩茶等超值服务，总之相比我住过的其它同级酒店性价比高，非常值得给大家推荐。这次玩的很开心，下次再来的话我还会住海晟．,"For the first time, I felt very comfortable as soon as I entered the store, and their services were very thoughtful.I drove to travel by myself. I arrived at more than 21:00 pm. When I entered the store to the front desk, the service staff at the front desk was very enthusiastic. I asked me to drive such a car.IntersectionTheir sales staff explained them when they booked a form, and I would arrive at night.And explained that I came to drive by myself, and it was very tired when I got it, so that they would arrange to check in as soon as possible.This kind of service made me feel very warm and feels like going home.The rooms are very clean and breakfast is also very good. It is particularly worthy of praise that the hotel's rooms are free to provide domestic long -distance calls, fruits, free products Wuyishan rock tea and other value -for -money services. In shortHigh, it is worth recommending to everyone.I am very happy this time. If I come again next time, I will live in Haisheng."
1,房间的设施不错，由于武夷山市是个小地方，酒店离景区有一定距离，如果没有自己开车就不太方便，但酒店整体设施很好，唯一遗憾的是入住的两天都没有办法宽带上网,"The facilities in the room are good. Because Wuyishan City is a small place, the hotel has a certain distance from the scenic area. It is not convenient to drive without driving by themselves, but the overall facilities of the hotel are very good."
1,2月29日入住3天。评分是对四星级的标准。所谓豪华大床房，房间很小，和香港丽都的小房间有一比。隔音确实比较差。大床的被子有点薄，要求再加个被子，酒店说“不行”，没有多余的，让我们把空调调高点。其实已经设为23度啦！位置有点怪，在一个高架桥边上，旁边是个工地，还好不吵（晚上酒店名字比较醒目）。步行距离锦江宾馆或者岷山宾馆（机场大巴终点站）约10分钟。早餐还好，成都那么多好吃的，也就不在意一顿早餐啦，嘿嘿。其它服务：check-in/out还算快，寄存行李/贵重物品单存，房间清洁，etc.还好吧。打车太难了。要不然，因为这几天天气太好，全成都市民都外出？好像成都白天到处打车都难。下次估计会尝试其他酒店。补充点评2008年3月4日：出酒店大门，向右走个百十米，有个红旗连锁超市。买水或者小吃，很方便。,"Check in 3 days on February 29.Rating is the standard for four -star.The so -called luxury large bed room is small in the room, compared with the small room in Lidu, Hong Kong.The sound insulation is indeed poor.The quilt of the big bed is a bit thin. It is required to add another quilt. The hotel says ""no"". There is no extra. Let us raise the air conditioner to raise points.In fact, it is already set to 23 degrees!The location is a bit strange. On the side of a viaduct, there is a construction site next to it.It is about 10 minutes away from the Jinjiang Hotel or Minshan Hotel (airport bus terminal).Breakfast is okay, so many delicious food in Chengdu, I don't care about breakfast, hehe.Other services: Check-in/out is quite fast, stored luggage/valuable items alone, room clean, ETC. Okay.It's too difficult to take a taxi.Otherwise, because the weather is too good these days, all citizens in Chengdu have gone out?It seems that it is difficult to take a taxi every day in Chengdu.It is estimated that you will try other hotels next time.Supplementary comment on March 4, 2008: Out of the hotel door, take a hundred meters to the right, there is a red flag chain supermarket.It is convenient to buy water or snacks."
1,前台服务不错。中餐厅的服务差些，健身房早上8：30开放，比较晚。,"The front desk service is good.The service of Chinese restaurants is worse, and the gym is open at 8:30 in the morning, which is later."
1,老用户了，就图个距离公司近，过马路就是。,"Old users, just look close to the company, just cross the road."
1,"服务确实不错！非常主动、热情！这在一定程度上抵消了房间不大的缺憾！那天本来只打算到前台取一份免费到机场快线香港站SHUTTLEBUS的时间表，取好时间表正准备离开时，门厅内的另一服务生立即微笑着主动前来询问我航班时间,并在时间表上勾下了建议我乘坐的哪一班SHUTTLEBUS的时间，告诉我只要在SHUTTLEBUS出发前5分钟到达门厅就可以了。服务生主动、周到、专业、细致的工作令人印象深刻！对于有意全方位了解香港的人来说，酒店所处的位置绝对提供了这种便利。在这里，你可以看到旧时的香港及普通百姓的生活。离SOHO美食区和兰桂坊也不远。","The service is really good!Very active and enthusiastic!This offsets a small shortage of rooms to a certain extent!That day, I only planned to get a timetable for the airport Express Hong Kong Station Shuttlebus for free that day. When the timetable was preparing to leave, another waiter in the hall immediately smiled and took the initiative to ask me for the flight time, and at the time of the flight, and at the time of the flight time, and at the time of the flight time, and at the time of the flight time, and at the timeThe schedule I suggested which shitbus I was going to take, and told me that I just arrived at the entrance hall as long as I arrived 5 minutes before ShuttleBus set off.The waiter's initiative, thoughtful, professional, and detailed work is impressive!For those who intend to understand Hong Kong in all aspects, the location of the hotel is definitely providing this convenience.Here, you can see the lives of Hong Kong and ordinary people.Not far from the soho food area and Lan Kwai Fong."
1,"大床房很舒服,宽敞,干净,安静,早餐一般.去的时候他们在搞活动,住一天送一天,门市价也只要245,只比携程价高几块钱,要不是赶时间,真想多住一天.开车的话要从毫州东出口下高速,不然到市里不好找.","The big bed room is very comfortable, spacious, clean, quiet, and generally breakfast. When they go, they are engaged in activities. They live for one day for one day.Stay more for one day. If you drive, you must exit from the east exit of the Mizhou, otherwise it is not easy to find in the city."
1,对本酒店的服务，环境，及房间等设施感觉非常满意并感觉物有所值。下次一定再来。,"It feels very satisfied with the service, environment, and rooms of the hotel and is worthwhile.Come again next time."
1,房间什么的都挺好，不过就是网络太慢了，真的是非常慢。我用迅雷试了试，结果是4K/S，跟最早的电话线拨号上网一样。,"The rooms are very good, but the network is too slow and really slow.I tried it with Thunder, and the result was 4K/s, which was the same as the earliest telephone line dial -up."
1,一般，总的来说服务不是很好，门童还可以，前台真的感觉很差，以为离香格里拉近的酒店应该也有一点水准吧，没想到这样，失望，房间是真的很不错，不过放在这边浪费了．,"Generally, the service is not very good in general, the door is okay, the front desk is really poor, thinking that the hotel near Shangri -La should also be a little bit standard. I did not expect that this, disappointWaste here."
1,非常不错的酒店。宽带免费，早餐还有武汉特产的热干面和豆皮供应，赞一个。,"Very good hotel.Broadband free, breakfast and the supply of hot dry noodles and bean skins of Wuhan, praise one."
1,酒店交通较为便利，旁边就是家乐福，房间比较干净整洁，都是小套房，但是声称所谓的厨房，只是摆设，无实际意义，前台服务质量还有待提高，,"Hotel transportation is relatively convenient. Next to it is Carrefour. The rooms are relatively clean and tidy. They are all small suite, but they claim that the so -called kitchen is just furnishings and has no practical significance."
1,酒店比较新，很多出租车司机都不知道；而且酒店没有大门，打车不是很方便。但是房间是公寓式的，有厅有房比较舒适；旁边的家乐福方便购物。一个值得再住的酒店。,"The hotel is relatively new, and many taxi drivers do not know; and the hotel has no door, and it is not very convenient to take a taxi.However, the room is apartment -like, and there are rooms and houses. It is more comfortable; Carrefour next to it is convenient for shopping.A hotel worth staying again."
1,是红会的培训中心，很好的，但地毯该更新了；房间的宽带应改成免费的；另外前台服务应更热情一点，不要有事业单位是老大的观念，客人住不住有没有收入无所谓，那就该改制换领导了！,"It is the training center of the Red Club, which is very good, but the carpet should be updated; the broadband of the room should be changed to free; in addition, the front desk service should be more enthusiastic.It doesn't matter, then it should be restructured to change the leader!"
1,房间很大，很安静；餐厅的菜量很大价格合理，服务也不错；地段去王府井地区非常方便；但房间的宽带收费不合理（10元/日），应改成免费的；开车去注意有60米的单向行驶。总之酒店不错很满意。,"The room is large and very quiet; the restaurant's dishes are very reasonable and the service is good; it is very convenient to go to the Wangfujing area in the area;Note that there is a unidirectional driving of 60 meters.In short, the hotel is good and satisfied."
1,"对于100多一点的这个价位来说,房间设施基本还可以,有点旧,卫生间不太好,洗澡的地方没有隔离,洗完澡马桶全湿了.空调电视都有,冬天有暖气片.服务还是很热情的,提供接机接站服务,行李员会主动把你的行李送到你的房间.补充点评2007年11月9日：还有一点,热水有点小啊,洗澡不是很舒服啊","For the price of more than 100 a little, the room facilities are basically OK, a bit old, the bathroom is not very good, there is no isolation in the bathing place, the toilet is wet after taking a bath.Very enthusiastic, provide the pick -up service, the luggage staff will take the initiative to send your luggage to your room. Supplementary reviews November 9, 2007: There is still a little bit, hot water is a bit small, bathing is not very comfortable to take a bath."
1,不错，有小院停车场，清净安全，非周末时间停车空间比较紧。因为宾馆深处干面胡同中间，胡同不宽，车行单向，所以经过车辆不多，再加上宾馆前有院落，即使入住朝向胡同一侧的房间，也基本没什么机动车的噪音，关上窗户就更加安静。入住期间，没有接到骚扰电话，这在这一片宾馆，实属罕见。尽管卫生间里放着酒店提供的避孕套，但未发现这里是淫窟的迹象。房间很大，不错。缺点只有三个：一是楼道和房间的地毯都有点脏；二是单人床太窄太短；三是隔壁声音特大时，此屋可听见。总得来说，比较满意。补充点评2007年6月10日：结帐速度很快,"Yes, there is a small courtyard parking lot, clean and safe, non -weekend parking space is relatively tight.Because in the middle of the noodles in the depths of the hotel, the hutong is not wide and the car dealers are unidirectional, so there are not many vehicles, and there is a courtyard in front of the hotel.The windows are quieter.During the check -in, I did not receive a harassment call. This is rare in this hotel.Although there are condoms provided by the hotel in the bathroom, no signs of kinky cave are found.The room is large and good.There are only three disadvantages: one is that the carpets in the corridor and the room are a bit dirty; the other is that the single bed is too narrow and short; the third is that when the sound of the next door is very large, the house can be heard.In summary, it is more satisfied.Supplementary comment on June 10, 2007: The checkout speed is fast"
1,是国营企业，宽带上网故障较多，而且没有专人维修，没有晚班值班IT人员，发生故障，只有等了。。。尤其是出差的朋友，请特别注意：因为宾馆是2星标准，没有每日明细单打印系统，给回去报销工作带来很大麻烦！！！如果只是来京游玩，还是可以选择的，环境较安静，是在胡同里，房间还算干净，但是木地板，冬天会感觉较冷。,"It is a state -owned enterprise. Broadband has more faults on the Internet, and there are no special personnel. There are no IT personnel on duty on duty. There is only a failure.EssenceEssenceEspecially for friends who are traveling, please pay special attention: because the hotel is a 2 -star standard, there is no daily detailed single printing system, which brings great trouble to the return to the reimbursement!IntersectionIntersectionIf you just come to Beijing to play, you can still choose. The environment is relatively quiet. It is in the hutong. The room is clean, but the wooden floor will feel colder in winter."
1,感觉不错，离奥运和旺角地铁都不远，服务也不错，房间虽然小（确实很小），布置的很合理，很温馨，也很干净。周围是香港的老居民住宅，出去吃饭往东、往南都有。,"It feels good, not far from the Olympic and Mong Kok subway, and the service is good. Although the room is small (really small), the layout is very reasonable, warm, and clean.There are old residential houses in Hong Kong, and they are east and south."
1,总的来说比较满意，酒店提供免费接车，接车时发生一点意外，酒店的车涉嫌无证经营被扣了，但是接站的员工还是打车将我们送到酒店，并未耽搁我们的行程。房间也不错，地方很好，后门就是去莫高窟和火车站的汽车，一般30分钟或更长点时间就有一班。酒店有自己的旅行社，我们通过它包车去的雅丹和玉门关等，服务不错。,"Generally speaking, the hotel provides free to pick up the car. A little accident occurs when picking up the car. The hotel's car is suspected of being deducted without a license. However, the employees who pick up the station still take us to the hotel without delaying our schedule.The room is also good. The place is very good. The back door is a car to Mogao Grottoes and the railway station. Generally, there is a group in 30 minutes or longer.The hotel has its own travel agency, and we have chartered Yadan and Yumen Pass through it. The service is good."
1,如果走对路的话，到地铁站步行５－１０分钟．附近有一个吃早茶的饭店，稻香，步行３分钟，吃早茶的，都是当地老年人，早茶味道不错．居住环境，有点象上海的南市区，马路小，附近在施工．步行到旺角，一路体验港人平民生活．房间奇小，淋浴间小，卫生间只有台盆和马桶，床宽９０厘米．这一套房间绝对不超过１０平方米．,"If you go the right, walk for 5-10 minutes at the subway station.There is a restaurant that eats morning tea, rice incense, 3 minutes walk, and eating morning tea, all of which are local elderly people. The early tea tastes good.The living environment is a bit like the Nanshi District of Shanghai, the road is small, and the construction is nearby.Walk to Mong Kok and experience the civilian life of Hong Kong people all the way.The room is small, the shower room is small, and the bathroom has only a basin and a toilet with a bed width of 90 cm.This room is definitely not more than 10 square meters."
1,"总体来说不错,就是有小姐电话骚扰比较烦.","Generally speaking, it is more annoying to harass with a lady."
1,环境很好，还可在6：30以后免费游览明孝陵，下次去南京还会住。,The environment is very good. You can also visit Ming Xiaoling for free after 6:30.
1,总体来说是个性价比相当高的酒店，从酒店外表到房间设施都很不错，通过携程预订还送了很大一篮水果，感觉挺好。大堂大得离谱，空荡荡的，不知当初设计师怎么想的，太奇怪了。,"Generally speaking, it is a very cost -effective hotel. From the appearance of the hotel to the room, the facilities are very good. It also gives a large basket of fruits through Ctrip booking. It feels good.The lobby is outrageous and empty. I do n’t know what the designer thought was."
1,"硬件设施没的说,房间豪华气派.唯一缺点是前台的退房服务不好,服务员为了自己办公方便,居然让客人自己提着行李从一个柜台挪到另外一个柜台.而且结帐过程中,还不时要停下来应付别的服务,一点都不尊重面前的客人.","If you do n’t say the hardware facility, the luxury of the room. The only disadvantage is that the check -up service at the front desk is not good. The waiter is convenient for his own office to move from one counter to another.From time to time, stop dealing with other services, and do not respect the guests in front of them at all."
1,"酒店大堂奇大,没有任何布置,空空荡荡,非常浪费空间,周边好像没什么吃饭的地方,房间对著西苑公园,景观还可以,算是洛阳最好的酒店了吧,服务真得不行,没有四星五星的水准,我们晚上下机坐的士到酒店,门僮站得老远没有走过来拿行李的意思,只好自己拉著行李去checkin,前台小姐服务还是可以的,走时也一样,门僮也是站在一边看,很奇怪,这家酒店培训工作可能做得不够","The hotel lobby is strange, there is no arrangement, empty and empty, and very wasteful space. There seems to be no place to eat around. The room is facing Xiyuan Park. The landscape is okay. It is the best hotel in Luoyang.The level of five -star, the taxi we took off at night to the hotel, the gate of the door did not come to get the luggage, so I had to pull my luggage to checkin.Standing aside, it's strange that this hotel training may not be done enough"
1,到敦煌入住这个酒店吃住行都方便，适合驴友。,"It is convenient to eat and live in this hotel at Dunhuang, suitable for donkey friends."
1,"印象不错,干净舒适,lobby大的有些夸张,美中不足是门口taxi拒载,因为路程近.","I am not bad, clean and comfortable, Lobby is somewhat exaggerated."
1,"服务员有礼貌,价钱超值.房间很大,不错,洗手间也很大.唯一隔音不是太好,而且附近食店不多.(但很多地方坐的士10~20元可到)*我住豪华房","The waiter is polite, the price is value -for -money. The room is large, good, and the toilet is also very large. The only sound barrier is not very good, and there are not many restaurants nearby. (But there are many people in many places for 10 ~ 20 yuan.)*I live in luxuryhouse"
1,很大气的酒店，房间设置布局很合理漂亮。卫生服务很好。,"A very atmospheric hotel, the layout of the room is very reasonable and beautiful.Health services are very good."
1,"每次出差都住在这家酒店，酒店在服务上做得很好.前台小姐很有礼貌,训练有素，非常热情，由于飞机晚上很迟到达，大堂经理还专门派车接了我，她们这种热情、细致、周到的服务使人有种宾至如归的感觉，下次还会到这家酒店入住.","Every time I travel around, I live in this hotel. The hotel has done a good job in terms of service. The front desk lady is very polite, well -trained, and very enthusiastic. Because the plane arrived late at night, the lobby manager also sent me to pick me up.This kind of enthusiasm, meticulous, and thoughtful service makes people feel like a guest. I will go to this hotel next time."
1,环境还算幽静。别墅标间的房间略小。卫生间倒还算宽敞，设施较好。服务还好。就是价格太高。,The environment is quiet.The room in the villa standard room is slightly smaller.The bathroom is quite spacious and the facilities are better.The service is okay.The price is too high.
1,房间是老了点，不过设施还满周全的，服务也不错，门口的好几个大堂副理都挺热情，对所有询问都耐心解答．,"The room is a bit old, but the facilities are full and the service is good. The deputy managers of several lobby at the door are very enthusiastic and patiently answers all inquiries."
1,地理位置不错，房间里设施较旧，属于比较好的三星酒店，基本有准四星的程度,"The geographical location is good, the facilities in the room are old, and it is a better Samsung Hotel. Basically, there is a quasi -four -star level."
1,"不错!新,价格合理,在市中心,但客人来访不好找.","Yes! New, reasonable price, in the city center, but guests are not easy to find."
1,"物美价廉的酒店.酒店的硬件很好,建议网友可以选择,整体看物价还值",The high -quality hotel. The hardware of the hotel is very good. It is recommended that netizens can choose.
1,酒店服务很好、房间里配有电脑、免费打长途、如果就餐出酒店往左走不到50米有一农家菜馆、卫生、服务态度好，实惠，值得一去，最好不要到街边的酒店吃饭、特别是不能跟导游去、有的不标价，张口随意要，价格离谱。,"The hotel service is very good, the room is equipped with a computer, free long -distance, if the hotel is out of the hotel less than 50 meters, there is a good attitude of health and service.Eating, especially if you can't go with tour guides, some do not marketer, open your mouth at will, and the price is outrageous."
1,"通过朋友介绍入住该酒店,总体印象很不错,有停车场,酒店大堂明亮气派,线条流畅.","Check in the hotel through a friend's introduction. The overall impression is very good. There are parking lots, the hotel lobby is bright, and the lines are smooth."
1,我以前在此酒店住过，但现在大变样了，早点是自助的其中有西点、有中试，味道还可以，特别是那天我的手提电脑忘带了，200多元的房间还配有电脑确实很便宜，前台服务很好，热情、乐于助人！我下次到太仓还要住这家酒店。,"I have lived in this hotel before, but now I have changed their shapes. Earlier, there were west points, middle test, and taste of self -service. Especially that day, my computer was forgotten.Very cheap, good front desk service, enthusiasm and helpful!Next time I arrive at Taicang, I will stay in this hotel."
1,服务还是不错，房间也比较干净，就是晚上能听到火车的声音，晚上还会有骚扰电话，办法就是拔线,"The service is still good, the room is relatively clean, that is, the sound of the train can be heard at night, and there will be harassing calls at night. The way is to pull the line."
1,"还比较物美价廉,免费长途很有特色,早餐也是不错的,电视机太小,视力不好,就看不清字,数字电视频道居然连cctv-6都没有,呵呵,不过,总的来说还是物有所值的",It is also relatively good and cheap. It is very distinctive for free long distances. Breakfast is also good. The TV is too small and the vision is not good.Say it is still worthwhile
1,设施不是很新但收拾的很干净，让人放心！不慎遗忘的价值不菲的摄影包被服务员及时发现且送回手中。。。让人感动！早餐免费且可口、粥粉面齐全！,"The facilities are not very new but clean up, which is reassuring!The valuable photography bags that are accidentally forgotten are discovered in time by the waiter and returned to their hands.EssenceEssenceMoving!Breakfast is free and delicious, porridge noodles are complete!"
1,五一的时候去度假感觉不错，房间很有情调，洗手间是玻璃透明圆弧形的蛮特别。房间里还有一个阳台，装修的也很漂亮，比较有特色。哈哈感觉不错在协程订的，还有一些其它优惠的东西，房间里放了一束玫瑰花感觉超浪漫。,"It feels good to go on vacation when I was on May Day. The room was very emotional. The toilet was very special with glass transparent arc.There is also a balcony in the room. The decoration is also very beautiful and more distinctive.Haha feels good in the coroutine, there are some other discounts, and a bunch of roses in the room feels super romantic."
1,酒店不大，但环境很不错，房间也很有地中海风格，还有个透明的浴室，很浪漫！,"The hotel is not large, but the environment is very good. The room has a Mediterranean style. There is also a transparent bathroom, which is very romantic!"
1,刚从蝴蝶谷回来，去之前看过网友的评论，现在再说说自己的感受：总体可以评4分以上（未到5分），不足之处如前人所说“隔音差、偏远交通不便、房间小”属实，但自己觉得这是一间很有特色的酒店，它的位置在桃园之内环境好、空气好、因此交通不便那是自然的了；还很喜欢它独特的的建筑和装修，其中别具风格的地板砖很漂亮，有人批评它的地砖我倒不以为然，因为这正是它的特别之处；豪华大床房里的浴室设计很不错，情侣入住平添3分情趣。总体感觉，值！另外，如果大家去南海影视城玩，千万别去旁边的“影视城实景农庄”吃饭，我在广东十年没吃过这么难吃的饭店，服务差速度慢也就算了（两个人十一点半进去二点出来，其中吃饭仅用了20分钟），上的清补凉山鸡老得咬都咬不动、，买单296元，闹心死了！,"I just came back from the Butterfly Valley and saw the comments from netizens before I went. Now let ’s talk about my feelings: Overall you can evaluate 4 points or more (less than 5 points).The room is small, but I think this is a very distinctive hotel. Its location is good in Taoyuan's environment and good air, so it is natural to have inconvenience.Among them, the unique floor tiles are very beautiful. Some people criticize its floor tiles, because this is exactly what it is; the bathroom design in the luxurious large bed room is very good, and the couple adds 3 points to stay.Overall feeling, value!In addition, if you go to the South China Sea Film and Television City to play, do not go to the next ""Film and Television City Real Landlord"" to eat. I haven't eaten such a unpalatable restaurant in Guangdong for ten years.Two o'clock in half, it took only 20 minutes for meals)."
1,比较不错的一家酒店！很人性化，服务满周到。最喜欢的是他们送来的水果。呵呵。下次来还住那！,"A good hotel!Very humane, full of service.The favorite is the fruits they sent.hehe.Come and live there next time!"
1,我住了两次，酒店的地理位置好，卫生干净，服务态度好，交通方便，配备观景电梯可尽览泉州市区全景，唯一缺点是早餐品种单一，早餐价位偏高。,"I lived twice. The hotel has a good geographical location, cleanliness, good service attitude, and convenient transportation. Equipped with viewing elevators can see the panoramic view of Quanzhou urban area. The only disadvantage is that the breakfast variety is single and the price of breakfast is high."
1,"准四星已经正式挂牌为四星了,房间很大很干净,服务也不错,酒店就在火车站旁边,交通很便利,而且大商等大商场立着也不远,购物也挺方便,不过也正因为在火车站旁边,酒店门口显得比较乱","The quasi -four -star has been officially listed as a four -star, the room is very large and clean, and the service is good. The hotel is next to the train station. The transportation is convenient, and the big shopping malls such as the big business are not far away.It is also because of the beside the train station, the door of the hotel looks more messy"
1,"这个酒店的所谓河畔全景房就是靠近拉萨河这边的房间,网友说的比较吵是因为在房子和河流之间有一条马路,整天都有车辆经过,比较吵就不奇怪了!",The so -called riverside panoramic room in this hotel is the room near the Lhasa River. The netizens said that there is a road between the house and the river. There are vehicles passing by all day. It is not surprising that it is more noisy!
1,"酒店地理位置比较好.附近有家""敦煌海鲜酒家""早茶不错。还有大型超市""麦凯乐""也在不远处.酒店的整体性价比属于中高.","The hotel has a good geographical location. There is a ""Dunhuang Seafood Restaurant"" in the nearby nearby.There is also a large supermarket ""McKle"" not far away. The overall cost -effectiveness of the hotel belongs to the high."
1,"诺覃祥渣,厄珩祥渣,憩苌腔Ⅰ耋剩.","Nuo Qin Xiangju, Er 祥 渣 苌 ⅰ ⅰ ⅰ 耋 耋."
1,"交通便利,恰好位于解放西路和黄兴中路的交界处；出门一拐就是步行街，而且濒临湘江。房间条件比三星要好一点（我住的豪华）；晚上附近的歌厅有一点点吵，12点以后没多大动静。免费宽带上网和早餐，自助早餐还不错。总之条件虽然不是很豪华，但是住着舒服方便；性价比不错。推荐入住。","The convenient transportation is just at the junction of Jiefang West Road and Huangxing Middle Road; it is a walking street when they go out, and they are on the verge of the Xiangjiang River.The room conditions are better than Samsung (luxury I live in); there is a little noisy in the singing hall near the evening, and there is not much movement after 12 o'clock.Free broadband access and breakfast, buffet breakfast is not bad.In short, although the conditions are not very luxurious, it is comfortable and convenient to live;Recommended stay."
1,作为一家经济型酒店，其最大的优势是地段，出门就是酒吧一条街、步行街，如果你想晚上去逛一下，走一下、玩一下的话，出门便是。标房有三种，推荐入住豪标，216元。但预定的时候最好要求大床房。否则可能给你一间带麻将桌的。不太方便的地方一个是酒店大门不太好找，第一次找了一圈才找到。而且进了大门，得先坐电梯至七楼才是总台。早餐一般，东西不是很多，而且是7－9点才有，结束的好像早了点。但对一家经济型酒店来说，总体感觉还行，对于216元的价格来说，还是比较超值的。,"As an economical hotel, its biggest advantage is the location. Going out is a bar street and pedestrian street. If you want to go shopping at night, walk and play, go out.There are three types of benchmarks. It is recommended to stay in the bid for 216 yuan.But it is best to ask a big bed room when you are booked.Otherwise, you may give you a mahjong table.It is not convenient to find the door of the hotel. It was not easy to find. It was found for the first time to find it.And when you enter the door, you must first take the elevator to the seventh floor.Breakfast is average, there are not many things, and it is only 7-9 o'clock, and it seems earlier.But for a economy hotel, it is generally good for the overall feeling. For the price of 216 yuan, it is still more value -for -money."
1,1.靠公路边上的房间隔音不太好，有点吵。结帐速度较慢。2、房间设施还可以，服务做到得比较好。,"1. The room on the side of the highway is not very sound sound, a bit noisy.The rate of checkout is slow.2. The room facilities are okay, and the service is better."
1,二次入住该酒店，感觉还是不错。而且随着对周边环境的熟悉，发现这里也不是原来印象中那么偏僻。酒店的电脑房间很不错，特别是电脑，居然用的是HP的品牌电脑及17''的液晶显示器，很是出人意料呢！当然房间也还是有缺点：比如浴室里居然连浴帘也没有，偏偏浴室又大，恰逢入住的两天气温又低，所以洗澡感觉很冷。另外，浴室的弧形推拉门虽然很别致，但实在很容易坏。补充点评2008年2月4日：该酒店的礼宾服务也特别值得赞许，我离开酒店那天还下着雨夹雪，门童顶着冷风飞雪足足在街边站了十几分钟才帮我拦到出租车，让人很感动。,"It feels good to stay at the hotel for the second time.And with the familiarity of the surrounding environment, I found that it was not as remote in the original impression.The hotel's computer room is very good, especially the computer. It actually uses HP brand computers and LCD displays of 17 '' ', which is unexpected!Of course, there are still disadvantages in the room: For example, there is no shower curtain in the bathroom, and the bathroom is large. It coincides with the low temperature of the two days to stay, so the bath feels very cold.In addition, although the curved sliding door of the bathroom is very unique, it is easy to break.Supplementary comment on February 4, 2008: The hotel's ritual service is also particularly worthy of praise. On the day I left the hotel, there was rain.It is very moving to the taxi."
1,很不错的一间酒店，特别是服务员的服务，很是值得赞许。我到酒店那天很晚，门童热情帮忙拿行李，并且推荐用餐的地点。后来就在酒店西餐厅用的餐，因为当时已是凌晨，只有我一个客人，所以感觉整个餐厅都是在我一个人忙碌，非常温暖。现在虽然已经过去很久了，但是想到这些仍是感到很温馨。虽然酒店的位置不在市中心，但考虑这么优质的服务，下次到成都还是会选择住在这里。,"A very good hotel, especially the service of the waiter, is worthy of praise.I was very late when I arrived at the hotel. Men Tong enthusiastically helped get his luggage and recommended the location of dining.Later, I used the meal at the hotel western restaurant. Because it was early in the morning, only I was a guest, so I felt that the whole restaurant was busy and very warm.Although it has been a long time now, I still feel very warm when I think of these.Although the location of the hotel is not in the city center, considering such a high -quality service, next time you arrive in Chengdu, you will still choose to live here."
1,虽然说酒店的房间有分散之嫌，但那种民族特色真的还很吸引人，价格也能让一般的游客接受！我喜欢,"Although the hotel's room is suspected, the national characteristics are really attractive, and the price can also accept ordinary tourists!I like"
1,酒店挺大，也很有特色。主要是位置好。离洋人街很近。可是酒店房间不能上网，比较郁闷。价格一般。,The hotel is quite large and very distinctive.Mainly good location.It's close to Western Street.But the hotel room cannot access the Internet and is more depressed.Generally.
1,银川不大，携程上就只找到8个酒店，一眼看中了绿洲酒店，因为价格不错，248元就有豪华房，而且可以上网，不能上网的我都不考虑！入酒店之后发现房间市价为388，前台给安排的9层，上去一看，不由感叹了一下，房间确实很大，一张大床一张单人床，视野相当开阔，酒店所属地段相当的好，设施齐全，房间冰箱里的食物也不是很贵，只不过去的那天正好是哀悼日，什么电视啊娱乐啊都没有！酒店对面街道里左手边有一家烧烤小店名叫《变态烤翅》有个叫狂魔烤翅，不怕辣的都去试试吧，老板宣传的口号是-专制各种不服，如果有机会的再去银川我肯定还要住这！补充点评2008年5月22日：我住的是9层，门卡一天后好象要重新激活，早餐10元不想走出去吃的话也还行,"Yinchuan is not big. Ctrip only found 8 hotels. At first glance, I saw the Oasis Hotel. Because the price is good, there are luxury rooms at 248 yuan, and I can go online. I do n’t think about it!After entering the hotel, I found that the market price of the room was 388, and the 9th floor was arranged at the front desk. When I went up, I couldn't help sighing. The room was really large. One large bed and a single bed with a wide vision.The facilities are complete, and the food in the refrigerator of the room is not very expensive. It is not just a mourning day that day. What kind of TV is entertainment!There is a barbecue shop on the left hand side of the street opposite the street. There is a mad grilled wings called ""Perverted Baked Wing"". If you are not afraid of spicy, try it.I definitely have to live in Yinchuan!Supplementary comment on May 22, 2008: I live in 9 floors, and the door card seems to be re -activated after a day. If you don’t want to go out for breakfast, you don’t want to go out to eat."
1,"不该是五星级酒店,该属于四星级吧!城区边,消费不方便,但真是个休息的好地方,性价比还可以.似乎服务跟不上,我们一行带了点东西到酒店,没有一个服务生主动来帮忙提箱子的.","It should not be a five -star hotel, it belongs to the four -star! The side of the city, consumption is inconvenient, but it is really a good place to rest. The cost performance is OK. It seems that the service can not keep up.A waiter takes the initiative to help lift the box."
1,"2008年1月16-20日,C楼405房间入住.也是看了前面的兄弟给的评价去的.大厅正中央挂着5星级的牌子.房间内2个字""巨大"".整体感觉不错.可惜电视要是壁挂的就更完美了.进门左手,会客市.可以玩麻将.前走.左手卫生间.5电吹风必备.再前卧室.也是大.感觉不错.性价比高。去广安的朋友首选.","From January 16th to 20th, 2008, Room C, 405 in Room C, also checked the evaluation given by the brothers in front. There are 5-star brands hanging in the center of the hall. The 2 characters in the room ""huge"".Unfortunately, if the TV is a wall -mounted, it will be more perfect.

1,"本人今次主要是到会展公务的,所以选择此间酒店,环境清静,对外交通非常方便.服务员热情有礼,入住和退房都很快捷.有一点酒店一定要尽快处理的:洗手间如地上有水,非常容易滑倒.","I mainly come to the exhibition officials this time, so I chose the hotel here, the environment is quiet, and the external traffic is very convenient. The waiter is enthusiastic and courteous, and it is very fast to stay and check out. One of the hotels must be dealt with as soon as possible: there are water on the ground as the ground.Very easy to slip."
1,最近半年第三次个人目的去香港，因为很熟了，所以很少坐地铁，更少打车，这样华美达的位置其实很不错，如果不是皇后大道上的万豪酒店，就成了海景房了，呵呵。楼下德辅道西很多巴士，A21可以直达，尽管我到的那天香港暴雨，大屿山高速封闭，只有搭机场快线进港岛，仍然可以在香港机铁站搭到免费的酒店空调小巴，大约十五分钟一班吧，没什么人，很不错。房间订度假产品的时候被告知只有双床房，但是我跟携程客服说给我标上就可以，到时候我再协商，到了酒店，check-in的时候柜台给我的就是大床了。房间是两隔间，电视不在卧房里，这点有点不好，而且电视节目只有8个......没有想到...其它的都很不错了，我对于住的地方要求不高，从来都觉得很好，而且公差住凯宾斯基或者凯悦什么的也没有觉得哪里好值那么多钱啊~还有一点就是我觉得来香港，还是要说英语的，当然要是会广东话那更好，香港人普通话水平远没达到“很不错”这一水平，沟通上的问题，当然会造成很多误会，说英语，大家都明白，而且也是客人受教育水平的一方面体现吧，酒店会客气很多。大陆人也应该养成给小费的习惯的，扫房，行李寄存，给一点点，会很不同。补充点评2008年8月8日：错了错了...机场巴士是A12了，不是A21哈~,"In the past six months, I went to Hong Kong for the third time. Because I was familiar, I rarely took the subway and rarely took a taxi. This place was actually very good.hehe.There are many buses in the west of Defu Road downstairs. A21 can be directly reached. Although the heavy rain in Hong Kong on the day when I arrived, Lantau Island high -speed closed. Only the airport express line entered Hong Kong Island.For about fifteen minutes, there is no one, very good.When I was fake products in the room, I was informed that there were only double beds, but I can talk to me with Ctrip customer service. At that time, I will negotiate again. When I get to the hotel, the counter is given to me when I check-in.The room is a two -separated room. The TV is not in the bedroom. This is a bit bad, and there are only 8 TV shows ... I didn't expect ... the others are very good.I have always felt good, and I have tolerance to Kobasky or Hyatt, and I don't think where the value is so much money ~ One more thing is that I think coming to Hong Kong, or I still want to speak English. Of course, if you know CantoneseTo better, the level of Mandarin in Hong Kong is far from reaching the level of ""very good"". Of course, the communication problems will cause a lot of misunderstandings. To speak English, everyone understands, and it is also a manifestation of the level of education by guests.You're polite.Mainlanders should also develop the habit of tipping. Sweeping houses, luggage storage, a little bit, will be very different.Supplementary comment on August 8, 2008: Wrong, wrong ... The airport bus is A12, not A21 ha ha ~"
1,入住和退房都很迅速，服务人员大多很热情，房间很大，比尖沙嘴的恒丰大多了，价格却低得多，卫生间有整体淋浴房，而且很干净，周围有很多美食，当当车到中环，金钟，铜锣湾方便，下次还会选这里。还有电脑房，上网25元一小时。补充点评2008年8月2日：我去海洋公园就是在与酒店隔一条马路的干诺道上乘的973，大约走5分钟，车票6.1元。虽然路程长些，就当参观，下车对面就是公园，来回机场，A12很方便，水街上就有站，去机场的，我买的A12来回票，65元。,"The movement and check -in are very fast. Most of the service staff are very enthusiastic. The room is very large. It is much lower than the Hengfeng of Tsimosujiao, but the price is much lower. The bathroom has an overall shower room and is very clean. There are many foods around.To Central, Jinzhong, Causeway Bay are convenient, I will choose here next time.There is also a computer room, which is 25 yuan an hour on the Internet.Supplementary comment on August 2, 2008: I went to Ocean Park 973, which was multiplied by the promise of a road from the hotel. It took about 5 minutes and the ticket was 6.1 yuan.Although the journey is longer, just visit it. The opposite of the car is the park. The airport is very convenient. There is a station on the water street. I go to the airport. The A12 ticket I bought is 65 yuan."
1,酒店整体感觉很不错。性价比比较高！1.楼下的接待很耐心也很热心。2.房间条件不错，很干净而且比较大。房间设施比较齐全，吹风机每个房间都有。3.酒店提供往返一些重要地点的小巴，只要提前电话通知前台就可以了。酒店的位置在西环，不是市中心，但是坐车很方便，从上环地铁口出来很多路电车都到。唯一让我有点不满意的是，入住时间是下午2点，一直在大堂等到2点才入住的哦。,"The hotel feels very good as a whole.The price / performance ratio is relatively high!1. The reception downstairs is very patient and enthusiastic.2. The room conditions are good, clean and relatively large.The room facilities are relatively complete, and every room of the hair dryer is available.3. The hotel provides minibus in some important places, just call the front desk in advance.The hotel is located in the West Ring, not in the city center, but it is very convenient to take a car. Many tram arrives from the Shanghuan subway exit.The only thing that made me a little dissatisfied was that the check -in time was at 2 pm, and I had been waiting at 2 o'clock in the lobby."
1,"对香港充满幻想的人初到香港如果住这个酒店,那不但幻想破灭,而且还要对""可怜""的香港人充满同情了-周围实在太...了!我就是率领着这样四个初来乍到的女麽麽于4月份住来这个酒店,给她们上了一堂生动的课!她们于是昂首挺胸地毫不自卑地冲杀于时代广场和尖沙嘴一带血拼了!酒店大堂的指路服务几乎没有,爱搭不理,一问三不知,只好靠自己摸索和街头问路!好在都还顺利.我们两个房间,一个要求加床,结果床加到了小房间,超挤不说,那床还格外软,人都陷进去了!一切看在价格的份上,都还OK啦,毕竟在香港么!补充点评2008年7月2日：千万不要为了""海景""两个字破费,趴窗台上斜着望出去,视线还要穿越两幢大楼的缝隙才能欣赏所谓的海景,都到香港了,海景不要太多哦!","For those who are full of fantasies in Hong Kong, if they live in Hong Kong, if they live in this hotel, they will not only be fantasy, but also have sympathy for the ""poor"" Hong Kong people-it is too ...!Women came to this hotel in April and gave them a vivid class! They then rushed their heads and murdered in the Times Square and Tsim Sha Tsui., I do n’t know if I ask three asks, so I have to explore and ask the street by myself! Fortunately, we are still smooth. Our two rooms, one requirement to add bed, but the bed was added to the small room.It is extremely soft, and people are trapped in! Everything is OK in the price of the price. After all, in Hong Kong! Supplementary reviews July 2, 2008: Do not break the word ""sea view"", lay the window sillLooking out obliquely, you have to cross the gaps of the two buildings to enjoy the so -called sea views. They are all in Hong Kong. Do n’t have too many sea views!"
1,别墅式客房，周边环境挺好的。别墅里面楼道有点黑，胆子小的还是别住了。室内比较简单，电视太小了，应该不是四星标准，靠虑到房价较低，也就凑合了。,"Villa -style guest room, the surrounding environment is pretty good.The corridor inside the villa is a bit dark, and the courage is still not living.The room is relatively simple. The TV is too small. It should not be a four -star standard. It is also necessary to make up for the low house prices."
1,房间还可以，位置比较偏，早餐不行，性价比还可以，下次还会入住．,"The room is ok, the location is relatively biased, the breakfast is not good, the cost -effective is okay, and I will stay in the next time."
1,酒店还可以，价格在自贡来说稍贵。服务还可以。,"The hotel is okay, the price is slightly more expensive for Zigong.The service is okay."
1,楼层结果是按酒店功能设计的。我遇到的服务都挺好，感到是经过标准培训的；可能改进了。房间不错，很干净；进门后感到不排斥、愿意睡在这里。房间配有沙发、不间断电源插座、自贡的简图。这对第一次来自贡的旅客挺有帮助。电视频道中有HBO。,"The results of the floor are designed according to the hotel function.The services I encountered are very good, and I feel that I have undergone standard training; it may be improved.The room is good and clean; after entering the door, I feel that I do n’t reject and want to sleep here.The room is equipped with sofas, uninterrupted power sockets, and brief pictures of Zigong.This is very helpful for the first passenger from Gong.HBO in the TV channel."
1,"酒店附近修路,出行比较痛苦.服务还是一如既往的好.偶尔去了趟健身房,觉得好小叻,设备都挤在一起,其他都还不错的BTW:餐厅有金,银卡的可以打折的yo~","The road near the hotel is more painful. The service is still good as ever. Occasionally, I went to the gym. I think it ’s so small, the equipment is squeezed together, and the others are good. The restaurant has gold.~"
1,"公寓不错,房间比较舒服,布置合理.就是现在价格高了.","The apartment is good, the room is more comfortable, and the layout is reasonable. The price is high now."
1,京广的环境一直都是我们的客人比较喜欢的。不过这次的服务水平似乎有些欠缺，我打电话去前台给客人留言的时候，居然那位先生跟我说他太忙了不能给我留言是不是酒店忙的时候，留言的服务就自动取消了？？？,"The environment of Beijing and Guang has always been preferred by our guests.However, this time the service level seems to be a bit lacking. When I called to leave a message to the guests, the gentleman told me that he was too busy to leave me a message.IntersectionIntersectionIntersection"
1,"我们总的感觉很好.服务和条件都不错.就是在次日早退房时开票的电脑有故障,因为我们要急走没开票.总台说开后给我们寄回.我也留了地址,好几天了还没到,不知寄出了没有?希望我们携程催一下,我还等着报销呢.","Our generally feels good. The service and conditions are good. It is the computer that the computer issued in the early check -up of the next day, because we have to rush to leave without invoicing. After the general desk said, send us back to us. I also leave the address.I haven't arrived for a few days, I don't know if I sent it? I hope we Ctrip urged, I still wait for reimbursement."
1,酒店的环境还挺好的，服务还可以。有机会还住那……,"The hotel's environment is pretty good, and the service is okay.Have a chance to live there ..."
1,浴室间有淋浴和浴缸二种，可依各人所好来使用！不过希望预订的时候，不要再用信用卡来做担保（因为房间也不是那么紧张）,"There are two types of shower and bathtubs in the bathroom, which can be used according to everyone!However, I hope that when booking, do not use a credit card to make a guarantee (because the room is not so nervous)"
1,好像早饭没有以前好了，品种也少了，居然没有煎蛋。星级酒店里很少碰见。房间有异味。打扫不够彻底。,"It seems that the breakfast is not as good as before, and there are fewer varieties. There are no fried eggs.Star hotels are rarely met.The room has a odor.The cleaning is not thorough enough."
1,卧室有点小，但有客厅没什么影响。客厅面积还不错，总体感觉不错。服务也比较职业，住的楼层比较高，接近顶层了，晚上也不吵，但不知道低楼层的情况，卫生间还挺大，厨房面积不小，设施也算齐备，可惜用不上。对于房间和酒店的服务都很满意。,"The bedroom is a bit small, but there is no effect in the living room.The living room area is not bad, and the overall feels good.The service is also relatively professional. The floor is relatively high, close to the top floor, and it is not noisy at night, but I do n’t know the situation of the low floor. The bathroom is quite large, the kitchen area is not small, and the facilities are also available.Satisfied with the service of rooms and hotels."
1,酒店环境不错，房间的感觉在家一样，5百多的价格感觉合理，下次还会选择。,"The hotel environment is good, the room feels at home, and the price of more than 500 is reasonable. I will choose next time."
1,房间很大，干净；拉开窗帘就可以看到无敌海景，令人觉得非常的惬意。我觉得这间酒店在闸坡来说算是一间不错的酒店。,"The room is large and clean; the invincible sea view can be seen when pulling the curtains, which is very comfortable.I think this hotel is a good hotel in Zhapo."
1,海悦的总体服务质量最近有所下降，我看到的几个地方是：1.一层bar的蛋糕、咖啡明显缩水，比一年前的口感和大小有很大下降2.我订的行政大床房，感觉和以前的普通大床房没任何区别，价格还贵了1003.行李房常常没人，寄存行李要等一会儿,"Haiyue's overall service quality has recently declined. Several places I see are: 1. A layer of BAR cakes and coffee significantly shrink, which has a lot to decrease from the taste and size a year ago.The big bed room, it feels no different from the previous ordinary large bed room, the price is still expensive 1003. There is often no one in luggage room."
1,总体还算不错的.房间有异味.服务挺好.,The overall is pretty good. The room has a odor. The service is very good.
1,还没有说完，因为这次是一个人住，也不想去外面吃，就来到她的中餐厅叫怡和轩还是什么的我忘记了，主攻粤菜。也是给我感动的一塌糊涂！一个人能吃到什么？一个女孩子更加难点菜。她们的服务员把我给照顾的无微不至！细节就不说了，最后吃完还送我下楼到门口，其实我是房客，认得路的呀！呵呵！美眉漂亮不说，很温柔体贴，这都是上层的管理和制度的导向，我认为海悦确实是以人为本，全心全意的为客户着想，比起那些所谓的5星级不知道好多少倍！前两天在锦江住店我还生了一回气呢！物超所值！我下次还来海悦啊！谢谢！补充点评2007年9月13日：地方偏不是问题，她的门童会很负责的帮你叫车。反正我每次出去他都帮我准备好了。我喜欢这里的幽静！,"I haven't finished saying it, because this time I live alone, and I don't want to go outside to eat. I have forgotten to come to her Chinese restaurant named Yihe Xuan or something.It was also a mess that moved me!What can a person eat?A girl is more difficult to order.Their waiters took me a hard care!I won't talk about the details. I finally took me downstairs to the door after eating. Actually, I am a tenant, and I recognize the way!hehe!The beautiful eyebrows are beautiful, very gentle and considerate. This is the management and system guidance of the upper levels. I think Haiyue is indeed people -oriented, and thinks about customers with all my heart. Compared with those so -called 5 -star, I do n’t know how many times better!I was breathless two days ago at the Jinjiang Store!Make -bearing worth it!I will come to Haiyue next time!Thanks!Supplementary comment on September 13, 2007: Local is not a problem. Her door children will help you call you a car.Anyway, every time I go out, he will help me prepare.I like the quietness here!"
1,预订的是行政二房一厅，别人建议说是性价比较高的酒店。预约的时候写到达时间为12：00－15：00，而酒店说明里写的要求到达时间是14：00。那天在12：30到酒店时，被告知房间还没有打扫出来，有些郁闷为什么那么慢，不过服务员倒是立即主动对讲机呼叫说先打扫我要的那两间，态度还是比较客气的。再根据评分的项目来评价一下。首先是房间，120平方米的号称不算为过，其实应该算是二房二厅二卫，互相独立互不影响，房间都是大床，还有衣橱。厅里有餐桌还有茶几，不显得拥挤。开放式厨房里煤气、热水器、微波炉、冰箱一应俱全，不过我好奇的翻箱倒柜却没看到锅碗瓢盆，不知是否下厨的话需要自备。我们订的两间大小不等，房型也截然不同。500多元可以住两家人，用四个字来形容――够大、够值。再说环境，这倒是和点评上说的差不多，装修比较老，有些损耗比较明显，看起来就是旧旧的，如果是自己的家就会想重新装修。大堂、电梯、走廊……反正都是旧旧的。也用四个字来形容――简单、普通。最后是服务，前台小姐和打扫的阿妈都有接触，前台的态度之前已经说了，因为两间房中一间先打扫好的桌子较小，不适合我们两个套间的人坐一起，特地要求阿妈开了另一间还没有拿到钥匙的房间看一下情况是否需要换房。阿妈没有什么不情不愿的样子，耐心的给我开了门，回答了我一些问题，然后关门继续打扫刚才打扫了一半的房间。洗澡时热水器一开始没有工作，找了服务生来看一下，脸上始终没有笑容，不过还是很尽职地给我们检查和试用，并主动提出把我们房间少一个空调器的事实告诉前台以免结帐时出现问题。总评：会考虑再入住这类酒店。,"The booking is the second room and one hall of administration. Others suggest that it is a cost -effective hotel.When the appointment, the time to the time of writing is 12: 00-15: 00, and the requirements written in the hotel description are 14:00.When I arrived at the hotel at 12:30 that day, the room was told that the room had not been cleaned. Some depression was so slow, but the waiter immediately took the initiative to talk about the two rooms I wanted first.Let's evaluate it based on the scoring items.The first is the room. The 120 -square -meter claim is not considered too much. In fact, it should be regarded as the second room, two halls, and two guards. Independent independence does not affect each other. The rooms are large beds and wardrobes.There are dining tables and coffee tables in the hall, which does not seem crowded.Gas, water heaters, microwave ovens, and refrigerators in the open kitchen are all available, but my curious turning the box and pouring the cabinet did not see pots, pans, and pans.The two sizes we ordered are different, and the room type is very different.More than 500 yuan can live in two people and use four words to describe -large and value enough.Besides the environment, this is almost the same as the comments. The decoration is relatively old and some losses are obvious. It looks old. If it is your own home, you will want to renovate again.The lobby, elevator, corridor ... are all old anyway.It is also described in four words -simple and ordinary.The last is the service. The front desk ladies and the grandmother cleaned have contact. The attitude of the front desk has been said before, because one of the two rooms in the two rooms are smaller.Mom asked Ama to open another room that had not got the key to see if the situation needs to be changed.Ama had no reluctance to look at me patiently, answered some questions about me, and then closed the door to continue cleaning the room that had just been cleaned.During the bath, the water heater did not work at first. I found a waiter to see it. There was no smile on my face, but I still did their best to check and trial it. I also took the initiative to tell the fact that the fact that we had one air -conditioner less than one air conditioner to prevent the front desk from checkout.problem appear.General Comment: Consider staying in such hotels again."
1,看了大家的好评才入住的，确实很有特色。不大的宾馆能评上五星自有它的道理。黑色是它的主色调，房间内部比较精致，窗比普同的床要低半截，但很舒服，卫生间和淋浴间的设计也巧妙，房间的房门像是一个橱柜似的，也能算是一个特点吧。早餐很精致，遗憾就是房间的窗户没同通风口。如是商务用，建议大家入住。,"After seeing everyone's praise, it is really distinctive.Not a big hotel can comment on the truth of five stars.Black is its main color. The interior of the room is more exquisite. The window is half lower than the bed in the same bed, but it is very comfortable. The design of the bathroom and shower room is also clever.Features.The breakfast is exquisite. Unfortunately, the window of the room is not the same as the ventilation.If you use business, it is recommended that you stay in."
1,位置较好。个人比较喜欢酒店大堂及房间的设计，美中不足就是房间比较小，给人拥挤的感觉。,"Good position.Personally, I prefer the design of the hotel lobby and room. The disadvantage of the United States is that the room is relatively small, giving people a crowded feeling."
1,这个价位住到这样的房间对我来说是惊喜，订的商务大床房，很夸敞舒适，房间最里面顺着靠窗的地方走进去居然是个小小的书房，很不错！,It is surprising to me at this room. The large -scale business bed room is very elastic and comfortable. It is a small study room in the innermost part of the room. It is very good!
1,我入住的是商务房，感觉还挺不错的。不过空调一般，打开后好像都没有打开空调一样，还好我入住那天天气不错，开窗后感觉也挺好的。房间的洗手间是玻璃透明的，如果有人在，感觉很尴尬。附近吃饭的地方不多，没有逛街的地方。酒店附件并不是太繁华！,"I stayed in the business house, and I felt pretty good.However, the air conditioner does not seem to turn on the air conditioner after turning on. Fortunately, the weather is good on the day of my stay, and it feels good after opening the window.The toilet in the room is transparent. If anyone is there, it feels awkward.There are not many places to eat nearby, there is no place to go shopping.Hotel accessories are not too prosperous!"
1,去丽江住此酒店不错，整体环境非常好。交通便利，性价比适中，物以所值。无论是公费商务，还是自助旅游，建议到丽江的朋友选择该酒店。补充点评2008年3月24日：风格别致，由很多院落构成，相当的安静．不像别的酒店是大院构成，噪声很大。,"It is good to go to Lijiang to live in this hotel, and the overall environment is very good.Convenient transportation, moderate cost -effectiveness, and value for money.Whether it is public business or self -service travel, it is recommended that friends who go to Lijiang choose the hotel.Supplementary comment on March 24, 2008: The style is unique, consisting of many courtyards, which is quite quiet.Unlike other hotels, it is composed of a large courtyard and has great noise."
1,服务良好，态度很好，感觉叫舒服。但房间窗子隔音不好，外面的噪音影响较敏感。位置不错，百米处就是包河。门前交通方便，离火车站飞机场都不算远。早餐一般，午晚餐未品尝过，出门右边不远的一条街上有些有特色的饭店。以后还会入住。,"The service is good, the attitude is very good, and it feels comfortable.However, the room windows are not sound insulating, and the noise outside is more sensitive.The position is good, and it is Baohe at 100 meters.The traffic in front of the door is convenient, and it is not far from the airport of the railway station.Breakfast is average. Lunch and dinner has not been tasted. There are some unique restaurants on the street not far from the right side of the house.I will stay in the future."
1,刚从丽江回来，在这个酒店住了三个晚上。总的来说，是个很不错的酒店，如果还有机会到丽江，我想我还会选择入住这个酒店。酒店有免费的接机服务，可惜我们一行八人是从香格里拉乘坐巴士到的丽江，没有享受到接机服务，但是酒店还是很热情地派服务生到我们下车的地方，把我们接进了酒店。酒店的房间不错，洗手间也很干净宽敞，还有免费赠送的水果和牛奶，很是贴心。不得不提的一点是，酒店的房间里还提供了一本《丽江的柔软时光》，供游客免费阅读，后来听同伴说，有的房间里还备有《圣经》，呵呵，我常出差在外，住的酒店数不胜数，有提供《圣经》的酒店还是头一回遇到，酒店确实比较贴心，只可惜我是信奉佛教的，如果能提供一些其他宗教的书籍，那就更好啦。。酒店的院子也是本人比较喜欢的地方，我和同伴在院子里拍了好多照片，很是漂亮的一个大院子，适合你在任何时候，坐在那里慵懒地发呆。。还有一点很好，就是酒店的早餐，从早上的6：30开放到下午的13：30，还可以在酒店露天的位置上晒着太阳懒懒的享受美食，很是意。。。唯一不好的一点是，茶室的收费问题，有天晚上，我们想在院子里泡茶聊天，于是想找酒店的茶艺居借用一套茶具（我们是福建的游客，随身都带着比较上等的铁观音），但是，酒店却告之，借用茶具是可以，我们可以自己提供茶叶，但是必须由她们来泡，而且，每泡一泡茶，要收取60元的手工费！！我们差点晕菜！要是我们一时茶兴大起，泡个9泡10泡的，这手工费都够住两晚酒店了！！希望酒店能稍微改进一下啊。。。除了这个，酒店给我的印象还是很不错的。。,"I just returned from Lijiang and lived in this hotel for three nights.In general, it is a very good hotel. If you have the opportunity to go to Lijiang, I think I will choose to stay in this hotel.The hotel has a free pick -up service. Unfortunately, the eight of us and his group were from the bus from Shangri -La to Lijiang. They did not enjoy the pick -up service, but the hotel was still very enthusiastic about the waiter to get out of us and took us into us.hotel.The hotel's room is good, and the toilet is very clean and spacious. There are also free fruits and milk, which is very intimate.One thing I have to mention is that the hotel's room also provides a ""soft time of Lijiang"" for tourists to read for free. Later, when I listened to my companions, some rooms were also available in the Bible. Hehe, I often travel around.There are countless hotels in the hotel. The hotel that provides the Bible is the first time to meet. The hotel is indeed more intimate. Unfortunately, I believe in Buddhism. If I can provide some other religious books, it is even better.EssenceThe courtyard of the hotel is also a place I like better. My companion and I took a lot of photos in the yard. It is a beautiful yard. It is suitable for you to sit there at any time.EssenceOne more good thing is the breakfast of the hotel. From 6:30 in the morning to 13:30 in the afternoon, you can also expose the sun to enjoying the food in the open sky of the hotel. It is very interesting.EssenceEssenceThe only bad thing is that the charging problem in the tea room, one night, we want to make tea and chat in the yard, so I want to find a tea set of tea sets in the hotel (we are tourists in Fujian.Tieguanyin), but the hotel told that it is possible to borrow tea sets. We can provide tea by ourselves, but they must be made by them, and every brewed tea must be charged 60 yuan!IntersectionWe almost dizzy!If we have a big tea for a while, soak 9 bubbles and 10 bubbles, this manual fee is enough to live for two nights!IntersectionI hope the hotel can be improved a little.EssenceEssenceExcept for this, the hotel is very impressive.Essence"
1,我是5月18-24日在王府饭店连住6晚，王府是丽江古城最好的饭店，保安及饭店的其他员工服务态度良好，对宾客非常有礼貌。饭店的设施也很齐全，宽带上网速度很快。特别是贵宾房的卫生间设计得舒适大方，躺在浴缸里透过大玻璃天窗晒太阳真是特美的享受。来丽江，建议大家一定要住在古城，如果既想享受纳西族优美古建筑庭院的家庭风格，又要求舒适安全，恐怕非王府饭店莫属了！我原先定的是官房花园别墅，后来朋友建议我住在古城里，那是我这次旅行最明智的选择。饭店的管理层由有海龟背景的张总挂帅，可以经常看见她在大堂或茶吧与中外客人聊天互动，如有什么问题或要求找到她她会亲自直接帮你解决，整个饭店的氛围轻松友好。早餐嘛，我很喜欢，不过那就看你的口味爱好了，我从英国回来，一碗米粉就能让我羡慕的不行！值得一提的是，这家饭店的自助早餐是开到下午一点半哦！这在中国是绝无仅有吧，很适合我这样的懒人！早餐煮咖啡也不错呢！对了，房间里还会送你水果，晚上你还可以打电话要热牛奶，虽然我并没有享用，但老板能这样待客，的确让人感到舒服。基督徒兄弟姐妹们还可以高兴地看到房间的放置的圣经，在国内，除了一些国际知名品牌酒店外，我看到这样做的好像这是第一家！张总本人就是个体贴待人的好姐妹。下次再去丽江，毫无疑问，王府就是我的家外之家了。注意，如果可能，尽量要求要二楼的房间哦。,"I stayed in the Wangfu Hotel on May 18-24 on May 18th. Wangfu is the best restaurant in the ancient city of Lijiang. The other employees of the security guards and restaurants have a good service attitude and very polite to guests.The hotel's facilities are also complete, and the broadband Internet access speed is fast.In particular, the toilet of the VIP room is comfortable and generous. It is really a beautiful enjoyment to lie in the bathtub through the large glass sunroof.When you come to Lijiang, it is recommended that everyone must live in the ancient city. If you want to enjoy the family style of the beautiful ancient architectural courtyard of the Naxi tribe, and it is also required to be comfortable and safe, I am afraid that it is the kingfu hotel!I originally set a villa in the Garden Garden. Later, my friends suggested that I live in the ancient city, which is the most wise choice for my trip.The management of the restaurant is coaches by Zhang, who has the background of the turtle, and can often see her chatting with Chinese and foreign guests in the lobby or tea bar. If you have any questions or ask her, she will help you directly solve it. The atmosphere of the entire hotel is easy and friendlyEssenceBreakfast, I like it very much, but it depends on your taste and love. When I come back from the UK, a bowl of rice noodles can make me envy!It is worth mentioning that the buffet breakfast of this hotel is opened until 1:30 in the afternoon!This is unique in China, it is very suitable for lazy people like me!Breaking coffee for breakfast is also good!By the way, you will also give you fruit in the room. You can also call hot milk at night. Although I did not enjoy it, the boss can treat the guests like this, which is really comfortable.Christian brothers and sisters can also happily see the Bible in the room. In China, except for some internationally renowned brand hotels, I see this as if this is the first one!Mr. Zhang himself is a good sister who is waiting for people.Going to Lijiang next time, there is no doubt that Wangfu is my home.Note that if possible, try to require the room on the second floor as much as possible."
1,"入住酒店办理手续时让我们等了很久,因为没有房卡;而且我们的预定信息在酒店前台的电脑中查不到.客房内应有水果,酒店服务员半夜11点才送到,而且不敲门就进入客房,感觉不太好.","Let us wait for a long time when check -in in the hotel, because there is no room card; and our scheduled information cannot be found in the computer at the front desk of the hotel. The room should be delivered in the room at 11 o'clock in the middle of the night, and the door was delivered.Entering the guest room, it doesn't feel good."
1,一进房间，非常满意，豪华间就是不一样，32英寸壁挂，还有电脑，很舒服的沙发，卫生间也非常干净漂亮，总体感觉很温馨，而且我们刚进房间不到十分钟，服务生就送来了一盘子水果，MM非常满意，这可是半夜三点多啊，服务确实不是一般的好。,"As soon as I entered the room, I was very satisfied. The luxurious room was different. The 32 -inch wall -mounted, as well as a computer, a very comfortable sofa, the bathroom was very clean and beautiful, and the overall feeling was very warm. And if we just entered the room for less than ten minutes, the waiter would be the waiter.Send a plate of fruits, MM is very satisfied, but this is more than three o'clock in the middle of the night. The service is really not good."
1,"该酒店位置佳,在市中心,出行超方便,楼下有班车直达机场,豪商房间配液晶电视感觉很好,并有电脑免费上网非常周到,一楼佳宁娜餐厅出品有保证,套餐二十多块,总体满意","The hotel is good. In the center of the city, travel is super convenient. There is a shuttle in the airport downstairs. The business room is very thoughtful with the computer with LCD TVs.Multi -piece, overall satisfaction"
1,"这家酒店其实在中国银行另一面,不要按地址寻访,问当地人也大都说不清,不如问中国银行大厦在哪,就好找多了.还有酒店早餐太差又贵.","This hotel is actually on the other side of the Bank of China. Do n’t search for the address. Ask the locals to say that it is not clear. It is better to ask the Bank of China Building, just find too much. And the hotel breakfast is too bad and expensive."
1,"酒店硬件倒是不错,但如果是商务旅行就不合适.前不着村,后不挨店.补充点评2007年4月7日：同时希望携程提供准确的信息。我希望住的酒店离凯莱比较近，工作人员告诉我五月花约距500米。实际上，全程2.7公里（出租车记程表显示数字）。仅酒店大堂到酒店大门就超过700米，每次只能让酒店叫出租，到凯莱要35元！如果路上截车才10元不跳表。","The hotel's hardware is good, but if it is a business trip, it is not appropriate. Do not have the village before, and do not take the store. Add comments on April 7, 2007: I hope Ctrip will provide accurate information.I hope that the hotel is closer to Kaile, and the staff told me that May spend about 500 meters.In fact, the whole journey is 2.7 kilometers (the taxi project table displays numbers).There are more than 700 meters from the hotel lobby to the hotel. Each time you can only let the hotel be called for rent, it costs 35 yuan to Kaile!If you cut the car on the road, you will not jump for 10 yuan."
1,酒店的大堂比较小，但是环境和卫生都比较满意，房间也不错，除了浴缸有点老旧外。还提供免费的国内长途和市内电话。就是晚上虽然关了窗户，还是能听到一些酒吧或者夜总会的音乐声音。早餐的质量有点和四星的不符。,"The lobby of the hotel is relatively small, but the environment and hygiene are relatively satisfactory, and the room is also good. Except for the bathtub a little old.It also provides free domestic long -distance and city telephones.Although the windows were closed at night, you can still hear some bars or nightclub music voices.The quality of breakfast is a bit inconsistent with the four -star."
1,做为一家高尔夫球会的会所酒店，勉强可以接受，没什么特点，也并没有什么针对高球爱好者的服务．酒店的球场景观房风景还不错，仅此而已吧,"As a golf club clubhouse, it is reluctant to be acceptable. There is no characteristic, and there is no service for high -ball enthusiasts.The scene of the hotel's court landscape room is not bad, just that's it"
1,"价格越来越高了,周遍不方便,去哪里都需要打车.不过装修风格很时尚舒适.服务态度不错.","The price is getting higher and higher, and it is inconvenient to go around. You need to take a taxi everywhere. But the decoration style is very fashionable and comfortable. The service attitude is good."
1,每次去深圳都住花园格兰云天，主要是房间比较新，硬件设施不错，服务也很热情。但以前小冰箱里的饮料都是免费的，这次发现要收钱了，真不知道赚这十几块钱和赢得客户的好感相比孰轻孰重？以前只要把换洗的衣物留在竹筐里，服务员就会免费帮着洗（当然是扔在洗衣机里传的那种），现在也没有了。早餐种类略有减少。总的来说以这个价钱在深圳相对于其他宾馆还是基本满意的，但服务有下降的趋势，希望引起酒店方面的重视。,"Every time I go to Shenzhen, I live in Grandma, Grand Yuntian, mainly because the room is relatively new, the hardware facilities are good, and the service is very enthusiastic.But in the past, the drinks in the small refrigerator were free. This time I found that I have to collect money. I really do n’t know how much I do n’t know how to make these dozen dollars and the favor of winning customers.As long as the clothes changed in the bamboo basket were left, the waiter would help the washing (of course, it was the kind that was thrown in the washing machine), and now it is gone.The types of breakfast are slightly reduced.In general, this price is basically satisfied with other hotels at this price, but the service has a downward trend, hoping to attract the attention of hotels."
1,地理位置不错，在市中心繁华地段，去天津街、清泥洼都很方便，楼下不远就有有轨电车；我住的是个mini标间，但比想像中的要大，有17、8平吧；服务什么的也都挺好，觉得不好的一点，上网居然要收费，20元/天，不过我也时间上，希望以后可以免费；电视可以收到韩、日、美、港等台，但有些台不清晰,"The geographical location is good. In the bustling area of the city center, it is very convenient to go to Tianjin Street and Qingniwa. There are trams not far from downstairs.8 square meters; the service is also very good, I think it is not good, it is necessary to charge the Internet, 20 yuan/day, but I also hope that it can be free in the future.Wait, but some Taiwan is not clear"
1,比较满意，位置不错，门前路已经修好。装修、设施均较新，细节服务很好，没有接到骚扰电话。,"It is relatively satisfactory and the position is good. The road in front of the door has been repaired.The decoration and facilities are newer, the details are very good, and no harassment call is received."
1,酒店的设施很新，从装修到房间里的电器都很不错。在九寨沟那边这个价住这样的房间算是挺有性价比的，大厅的装修也比较有特色。24小时供热水比较稳定，酒店门口200米处就有提款机，挺方便的。早餐完全比不上标准五星的，只有现烧的荷包蛋、咖啡和橙汁还能吃吃，除了肉肠几乎没什么荤菜供应，面包也只有黄油可以配。烧出来的中餐都是素菜为主而且口味偏咸，只能下粥。感觉是五星的大厅，四星的房间和二星的早餐。一个缺点是离九寨沟口比较远，单程出租车过去大概要50元，当然晚上回酒店也要50元。另一个缺点是房间造得太密集，从我住的房间的窗口看出去就是一片麻将牌式的房子，估计是为了最大化利用这块地，居然围着三面都是一样的房子，没啥窗外风景可言。,"The hotel's facilities are new, and the appliances from decoration to the room are very good.This room in this price in Jiuzhaigou is quite cost -effective, and the decoration of the hall is also more distinctive.The 24 -hour heating water is relatively stable. There are cash machines at 200 meters at the entrance of the hotel, which is very convenient.Breakfast is completely inferior to the standard five -star. Only the boiled poached eggs, coffee and orange juice can also be eaten. Except for the supply of sausages, there are almost no amaranth supplies, and bread can only be equipped with butter.The burned Chinese food is mainly vegetarian and salty taste, and can only be porridge.It feels like a five -star hall, four -star room and two -star breakfast.A disadvantage is that it is relatively far away from the mouth of Jiuzhaigou. The one -way taxi has been about 50 yuan in the past. Of course, it costs 50 yuan to return to the hotel at night.Another disadvantage is that the room is too dense. From the window of the room I live, it is a mahjong -style house. It is estimated that it is to maximize the use of this land.Scenery at all."
1,房间比较大，床很大（景观房双床）4尺半，早餐也挺丰富。现在下午13点、14点、15点也可带客人进恐龙园。办入住只有两个人，比较慢。中西自助餐厅装修暂停营业，午饭及晚餐只有中餐厅。周围没有餐馆。恐龙园内吃饭价高物差。,"The room is relatively large, the bed is very large (double bed in the landscape room), and the breakfast is quite rich.Now at 13:00, 14, and 15 pm, you can also bring guests into the dinosaur garden.There are only two people in handing in, which is relatively slow.The decoration of Chinese and Western self -service restaurants is suspended, and there are only Chinese restaurants in lunch and dinner.There are no restaurants around.The price of dinosaurs is high."
1,就在中华恐龙园边上，如果去中华恐龙园玩，这是不错的选择。我们订的大床房因为在装修，所以免费升级的套房，房间非常宽敞，有沙发，也有餐桌，酒店的饭菜也可以，非常满意。,"Just beside the China Dinosaur Garden, if you go to the China Dinosaurs to play, this is a good choice.Because the large bed room we order is in the decoration, the free upgraded suite, the room is very spacious, there are sofas, there are dining tables, and the meals of the hotel are also very satisfied."
1,住的豪华大床房，房间基本无可挑剔，就是阳台脏了些。早餐要早点去，晚了连座位都没有。还是比较满意的。,"The luxurious large bed room where the room is basically impeccable, that is, the balcony is dirty.Breakfast should go early, and there is no seat late.Still satisfied."
1,硬件可以，安静，无骚扰电话，比较舒适。出现两个问题：1.晚上好像停过电，电视机又突然启动，吓一跳。2.晚餐，自助没什么东西吃。早上较好。宾馆反馈2008年7月9日：多谢您的意见，我们会继续改进，尽量满足您的要求！,"Hardware, quiet, no harassment call, more comfortable.Two problems occur: 1. It seems to stop power at night, and the TV suddenly starts, which is startled.2. Dinner, there is nothing to eat for buffet.Good morning.Hotel feedback on July 9, 2008: Thank you for your opinions, we will continue to improve and try to meet your requirements!"
1,"总体上来说还是不错的一家四星级酒点,毕竟是许昌市最好的去处了.唯一的缺点房间的隔音不太好,隔壁打麻将的声音吵的我好半天没有睡着.","In general, it is still a good four -star wine. After all, it is the best place to go to Xuchang. The only shortcomings of the shortcomings are not good. The sound of Mahjong next door is noisy for a long time. I didn't fall asleep for a long time."
1,2007年十一的假期路过许昌入住了这个酒店，住的商务大床房，房间十分干净，床上用品什么的也很干净，环境相当安静，是我十一出行中睡得最踏实的一觉。酒店周边环境也比较方便，有大商场，有餐厅。240元的价格更是不错。但是四星级的酒店怎么也得搞两瓶免费水吧。不过还是值得推荐一下的。,"In the 11th holiday of 2007, Xu Chang passed Xu Chang and settled in the hotel. The large business bed room was living. The room was very clean.The surrounding environment of the hotel is also relatively convenient, with large shopping malls and restaurants.The price of 240 yuan is even more good.But four -star hotels have to engage in two bottles of free water.But it is worth recommending."
1,"我们是全家4个大人1个小孩一齐入住的,定了一个三房家庭套间,它的套间很不错,三个房间,一个客厅,而且有两个卫生间,完全可以满足一家大小的需要,有两个房间里面分别还有两张床,另一间房有一个大床.基本上一个套房住6个人都不成问题,非常经济!房内装修都OK,只是墙上都没有贴墙纸,白晃晃的墙壁,看起来太普通.卫生间墙上也已有地方显陈旧,窗边有点脏脏的感觉.不过虽然我们夏天去,但是客厅房内都有空调,非常舒适.(大堂里电梯内没有空调,很闷热,非常奇怪!)而且我最担心的蚊子都没有出现!!但是房内的厨房完全是败笔之作.有电饭煲,还有消毒碗柜在内,但是无碗碟筷,更无炉灶!这些东西我都不知道摆在那里有什么意义.难道我去旅行还要买碗筷!还要在那里煮饭?不过仅有微波炉是最实用的,因为可以热东西或热牛奶给小朋友吃.酒店环境一般,周围无景致.到市中心一般都要打的7~10元.但省钱的话,门前也有BUS站1块钱直达市内.我们半夜到达酒店前台的时候,拿老公的国际卡CHECKIN,连续试了三四张卡都没有反应,结果那个坐在前台最左边长着大饼脸的女的臭着一张脸,硬说我们的卡坏了!但我们的卡明明早上才从广州的酒店CHECKOUT出来,却完全没问题!最后他们才发现,是他们的机器坏了,还没修好!结果我们付了两千多现金才可以入住!非常气愤这个女人的服务质素!小声说一句,这个是本地人来的.相反,另外一个说广州话的女孩子态度就非常和善,热心,超赞!嗯,另外还值一提的是,房间的服务非常不错,做清洁的女孩子很可爱敬业,并且热心!我们房内的衣物忘了送洗,还特地留下一张纸条提醒我们!很喜欢她!顺便还说一下酒店的餐厅吧.早茶晚茶很多人,甚至很多本地人都在这里吃.全都是广式茶点,非常丰富,而且味道不错,皮蛋瘦肉粥是必点的,另外蛋挞也很好吃.猪肚汤的猪肚就稍微太硬了些.午餐我试过一次,不过连烧鸭面都无得吃,而且点了一个菜,一等就是半个钟头.太久了,而且价格也很高!所以建议大家还是去外面的海鲜大排档或蛋家棚酒楼吃海鲜更好!:P,写太长了!不好意思!总的来说,这家度假酒店我们全家还是非常满意的,我给到4分!因为它的经济与实惠!","We are 4 adults and 1 child in the family. We set in a three -bedroom family suite. Its suite is very good. Three rooms, one living room, and two bathrooms can fully meet the needs of a family. There are two two. There are two two.There are two beds in the room, and there is a large bed in the other room. Basically, 6 people in a suit are not a problem. It is very economical! The decoration of the room is OK, but there is no wallpaper on the wall.It looks too ordinary. There are already outdated places on the wall of the bathroom, and the window is a bit dirty. However, although we go in summer, there are air conditioners in the living room. (There is no air conditioner in the elevator in the lobby.Sullen, very strange!) And my most worried mosquito did not appear !! But the kitchen in the room was completely defeated. There are rice cookers, and disinfection cups, but there are no dishes and chopsticks, and there are no stoves!I do n’t know what it means to place there. Do I have to buy dishes and chopsticks when I go to travel! I still have to cook meals there? But only microwave oven is the most practical, because you can eat hot things or hot milk for children. The hotel environment.Generally, there is no scenery around. Generally, 7 ~ 10 yuan to be played in the city center. But if you save money, there is also a BUS station in front of the door.After trying three or four cards in a row, there was no response. As a result, the woman sitting on the far left of the front desk with a stinky face, saying that our card was broken! But our card Mingming only in the morning from GuangzhouThe hotel checkout came out, but it was completely fine! In the end they found out that their machine was broken and had not been repaired yet! As a result, we paid more than 2,000 cash to stay! Very angry with the quality of this woman's service!This is from the locals. On the contrary, another girl who speaks Guangzhou is very kind, enthusiastic, and superb! Well, it is worth mentioning that the room service is very good.Cute and dedicated, and enthusiastic! The clothes in our room forgot to send them, and left a note to remind us! I like her very much! By the way, talk about the hotel's restaurant. Many people in the morning tea and night tea, even many local peopleThey are all eaten here. They are all Cantonese refreshments, which are very rich and taste good. Preserved eggs and lean porridge are must -order.Once, but I did n’t even eat the roast duck noodles, and I ordered a dish, the first is half an hour. It ’s too long, and the price is very high! So it is recommended that you go to the seafood stall or egg house shed outside.It is better to eat seafood in the restaurant!: P, write too long! Sorry! In general, our family is still very satisfied with this resort. I gave 4 points! Because of its economy and affordability!"
1,房间很好，早餐100多其实没什么吃的，早餐很差。,"The room is very good. There is nothing to eat for more than 100 breakfast, and breakfast is poor."
1,住的相当不错，非常满意，服务还需改进，特别是有房间的话要赶快打扫，别让顾客等，订间房几个小时还搞不出来吗？,"Living is quite good, very satisfied, and the service needs to be improved. Especially if you have a room, you have to clean it quickly. Don't let customers wait. Can you not do it for a few hours in the booking room?"
1,"订的是双人房,感觉房间有点小,放了两张床之后就没什么空间了,沙发也只有一个单人的.觉得最不好的是洗手间太太太小了-好挤,门拉直打开就到浴缸的边了.除了小的问题之外,房间还是很舒服的.自助早餐不错,很丰富,可惜吃不了多少...会所在酒店外面,觉得有点不方便.有室内游泳池,去游泳还一定要求带游泳帽,最终没下水,有点郁闷.","I booked a double room. I feel that the room is a bit small. After putting two beds, there is no room for space. The sofa has only one single person. The worst is the lady of the toilet.On the side of the bathtub. In addition to small problems, the room is still very comfortable. The buffet breakfast is good and rich, but unfortunately I ca n’t eat much ... It ’s a bit inconvenient outside the hotel. There is an indoor swimming pool.It must be required to bring a swimming cap. In the end, there was no launch, and it was a bit depressed."
1,房间比较大，很舒适；隔音效果还不错；但早餐品种太少，电视节目不够丰富。如果周末的房间也是298，就比较实惠了。,"The room is relatively large and comfortable; the sound insulation effect is not bad; but the breakfast variety is too small, and the TV show is not rich enough.If the weekend room is also 298, it is more affordable."
1,在肥城来说，该酒店应该是无可替代的了。酒店前台以及其他服务人员态度良好，早餐选择性较少，且硬件不配套（比如说没有咖啡勺），房间隔音效果欠佳（主要是房门隔音效果差）以至于连续几个晚上都没有休息好。,"For Feicheng, the hotel should be irreplaceable.The hotel's front desk and other service personnel are good, with less selection of breakfast, and the hardware is not equipped (such as no coffee spoon), the room sound insulation effect is not good (mainly the door of the door of the door)good."
1,四星房间比较干净早餐品种太少服务员态度还算不错且动作较快住宿收停还车费比较不爽距离九华山还有段距离，而且来回都要收过路费，郁闷住在这里吃饭问题太难解决，青阳的大饭店没见到，小饭店脏且品种少。提醒如果自驾去九华，进山门票与汽车进山票都可以登记二次使用的，即第一日出山时，在门口登记身份证，第二日凭身份证再次入内，不要再次买票。,"The four -star room is relatively clean breakfast varieties. There are too few types of waiter. The attitude of the waiter is pretty good, and the movement is fast.Solution, the big restaurants in Qingyang did not see it. The small restaurants were dirty and less varied.Remind that if you drive to Jiuhua by yourself, you can register the secondary use of tickets and cars into the mountain. That is, when you leave the mountain on the first day, you can register your ID card at the door. On the second day, you can enter the ticket again with your ID card. Do not buy the ticket again."
1,"不错的酒店,去九华山很方便,比在山上动不动就5,6百的房间好多了.","Good hotel, it is convenient to go to Jiuhua Mountain, much better than in the mountains with 5,600 rooms."
1,周围环境比较安静，房间干净装潢较新，总的来说性价比高。离九华山有30分钟的车程，没有车的话会稍微有些不便。早餐品种太少，不过看在是送的也就算了。,"The surrounding environment is relatively quiet, and the room is clean and new, in general, cost -effective.There is a 30 -minute drive from Jiuhua Mountain. If there is no car, it will be slightly inconvenient.There are too few breakfast varieties, but even if it is given."
1,"环境非常好,服务也到位.公司的韩国人很喜欢住这家酒店.",The environment is very good and the service is in place. The company's Koreans like to live in this hotel.
1,"酒店环境和整体服务是不错的.只有一点需提醒以后入住的朋友:通过酒店前台预订公园游船或者旅游项目有住店客人折扣(8折),但需由酒店经理带到公园购票才能享有,且事先也未和客人说明.感觉操作流程不规范.建议只要游客提供房卡就能享有公园优惠,这样也能鼓励游客选择入住.另外酒店门外设有很多餐桌,在我们要求在外面用早餐时却被拒绝,称早晨因人手不够,只能在餐厅内用早餐.其实酒店提供的早餐很简单,在外用餐并不会增加太多麻烦,客人感觉也会更好.不然岂非浪费了室外的好风景和好空气?宾馆反馈2008年6月19日：感谢您下榻西溪度假酒店。对您预订游船等项目的不悦表示歉意。酒店虽然地处西溪湿地公园内，但酒店与湿地公园分属两家单位，因此酒店客人如自行去湿地公园游玩是不能享有公园对酒店的优惠政策，敬请谅解。酒店接待处有优惠的门、船票供应。欢迎您再次光临。","The hotel environment and overall service are good. Only one thing needs to remind friends who stay in in the future: booking parks or tourist guests at the front desk of the hotel (20 % off), but the hotel manager needs to be taken to the park to buy tickets to enjoy it.And did not explain it with the guests in advance. I feel that the operation process is irregular. It is recommended that as long as the tourists provide a house card, they can enjoy park discounts, so that tourists can also be encouraged to choose from. In addition, there are many dining tables outside the hotel door.When it was rejected, it was said that the morning was not enough, and the breakfast could only be used in the restaurant. In fact, the breakfast provided by the hotel was very simple.Good scenery and good air? Hotel feedback on June 19, 2008: Thank you for staying in Xixi Resort Hotel.Speak apologies for your displeased of reservations such as cruise ships.Although the hotel is located in the Xixi Wetland Park, the hotel and the wetland park belong to two units. Therefore, the hotel guests do not enjoy the preferential policies of the hotel for the hotel. Please forgive me.There are preferential doors and tickets for the hotel reception.Hope to see you next time."
1,"总体来说很不错.就是地理位置并不是想象中的好.虽然也被列入陆家嘴附近.虽然服务人员说离正大广场很近.可是还是相差很大的.总体还是很不错的,相对于其他住酒店的经历.",Overall it is very good. The geographical location is not as good as imagined. Although it is also included in Lujiazui. Although the service staff said that it is close to Zhengda Plaza.The experience of living in the hotel.
1,"上个礼拜刚去过...环境还是不错的.饭菜也很可口,价格略贵.房间不错,很古朴,很安静,在那休息是很不错的.唯一的缺点是房间的隔音设施太差,如果同一幢楼里面有几个不同的客人,在碰上不注意的...太恐怖来","I just visited last week ... the environment is still good. The meal is also very delicious, the price is slightly more expensive. The room is good, very simple, very quiet, and the rest is very good. The only disadvantage is that the sound insulation facilities in the room are too bad.If there are a few different guests in the same building, they are not noticeable ... too horrible"
1,"酒店地理位置不错，就在西溪湿地，酒店好比置身花园中，这个很好！但房间显得有些局促，太小了！尤其这次住的是底楼标准间，感觉厕所有强烈的异味，要将门紧闭，窗户打开才不觉得难受,这个提醒酒店要注意改进！宾馆反馈2008年5月13日：感谢您下榻西溪度假酒店。对于您在入住期间遇到的状况，给您带来不变，酒店深感抱歉。针对您提到的问题，我们已邀请专业人士进行了管道整改，该问题已解决。我们真诚期待您的再次光临。","The hotel has a good geographical location. It is in Xixi Wetland. The hotel is like being in the garden. This is good!But the room looks a little cramped, too small!Especially this time I live in the standard room of the bottom floor. I feel that the strong odor of the toilet is tightly closed. It is not uncomfortable to open the door and the window is opened. This reminds the hotel to pay attention to improvement!Hotel feedback on May 13, 2008: Thank you for staying in the Xixi Resort Hotel.The hotel is deeply sorry for the situation you encountered during your stay, and the hotel is deeply sorry.In response to the problems you mentioned, we have invited professionals to rectify pipelines, and this problem has been resolved.We sincerely look forward to your visit again."
1,前台：告知没有大床房，说我入住的时候选择的是高级间，虽然说明1个人入住，但是没有强调大床房，所以酒店没有保留。不甘心，前台冷笑：那你去问携程好了...OK，算你狠。然后前台反复游说我再多花400块钱（事后得知是460块钱）升级到行政楼层，我看也不多，答应了。前台脸色顿时转好，真行。客房：一般。我入住得晚，所有得行政楼层特别设备都没有了。表扬洗衣房的小伙子，取送衣服非常快，熨得也非常好。早餐：行政楼层可以在35层吃，但是我喜欢热闹，还是去了1楼。让服务员帮我去跟师傅说做一份馄饨，服务员怎么都不愿意，说如果我没有表述清楚佐料他们怕负责。我说不怕，放什么都行，服务员好歹去了，后来端给我一盘煮好的湾仔码头的速冻饺子。。。这接近200块钱的早餐真不错。吃完早餐：酒店结构复杂，问了两次路，两次服务员均告知错了方向。酒店服务员搞不清客人去33楼应该坐那部电梯，很无语。当然，他们笑容还是很灿烂的。最后一句感叹：上海2000块钱以下的5星级，没有一家像样的。他们都知道，这个价位酒店的客人，都是像我这样只愿花不超过2000，但是又喜欢号称五星级的。。。所以他们完全没有提高服务的动力。,"Front desk: I told that there was no big bed room, and said that when I was in my check -in, I chose a high -level room. Although it showed that one person was in, it did not emphasize the large bed room, so the hotel did not keep it.Unwilling, sneer at the front desk: Then you go to ask Ctrip ... ok, you are ruthless.Then I repeatedly lobbying at the front desk to upgrade to the administrative floor after repeatedly spent 400 yuan (learned that it was 460 yuan), I didn't see much, agreed.The face of the front desk turned suddenly, and it was true.Room: General.I stayed late, and all the special equipment of the administrative floor was gone.The guy who praised the washing room was very fast and ironed very well.Breakfast: The administrative floor can be eaten on the 35th floor, but I like to be lively, and I still go to the first floor.Let the waiter help me to tell the master to make a ravioli, and the waiter was unwilling, saying that if I did not express it clearly, they were afraid of responsibility.I said it was not afraid, everything was done, the waiter went, and later gave me a plate of cooked fast -frozen dumplings at the Wan Chai terminal.EssenceEssenceThis is a good breakfast that is nearly 200 yuan.After eating breakfast: The hotel structure is complicated. After asking the road twice, the waiters told the direction of the wrong direction.The hotel waiter couldn't figure out that the guests should take the elevator on the 33rd floor, which was speechless.Of course, they smiled very brightly.The last sentence sighs: There is no decent family in Shanghai 2,000 yuan.They all know that guests at this price hotel are like I only want to spend more than 2000, but they also like to be known as five -star.EssenceEssenceSo they did not improve the motivation of services at all."
1,"相比较前一天的酒店,简直是天壤之别.地理极其优势,房间舒适,价格合适.","Compared with the hotel the day before, it is a lot of differences. The geography is extremely advantageous, the room is comfortable, the price is appropriate."
1,地点和服务都不错：）适合商旅用途～～～～～～～～～,The location and service are good :) Suitable for business travel ~~~~~~~~
1,酒店位子非常好，交通购物都很方便。我预定的是高级双床房，因为飞机晚点，到达宾馆后告知双床房已没有，不过免费为我们升级给了一个套房并还给11岁的儿子铺了一个加床，感觉很温馨的。房间蛮大，很干净。就是洗手间小了一点。49楼的旋转餐厅能看到上海的全景，很美，服务生的英语蛮流畅，服务也很到位。只是旋转餐厅的菜系比较少，让人很难选择。总体都不错，下次还会住这间酒店。,"The hotel seat is very good, and transportation and shopping is very convenient.I booked a high -end double bed, because the plane was late. After arriving at the hotel, I informed that the double bed was no longer, but it was free to upgrade a suit and paved a bed to the 11 -year -old son for free. It felt very warm.The room is quite large and clean.It's a little smaller in the washing room.The rotating restaurant on the 49th floor can see the panorama of Shanghai. It is beautiful. The waiter's English is quite smooth and the service is in place.It's just that there are fewer vegetables in the restaurant, which makes it difficult to choose.Overall is good, I will stay in this hotel next time."
1,大厅没有道，结果出租车开到后面去了，我们自己又提着行李进去，也没有行李员来帮忙。位置不错，服务没有什么特殊之处，也可能我总是出差，行家了，需要他人帮助的地方实在不多，没有多少感觉。,"The lobby did not say, but the taxi went to the back, and we went in by our own luggage, and there were no luggagers to help.The location is good, there is nothing special about the service, and maybe I always have a business trip, experts, there are not many places to help others, there is not much feeling."
1,酒店环境和服务都还不错，地理位置也不错，尤其是酒店北面的川北凉粉确实好吃，不过就是隔音效果不好，睡觉的时候总是被外面的汽车吵醒。,"The hotel environment and services are not bad, and the geographical location is also good, especially the northern Sichuan jelly north of the hotel is really delicious, but the sound insulation effect is not good, and it is always awakened by cars outside when sleeping."
1,每次到南充都住这里，这次有点特别，当时住十二楼碰到了汶川地震，楼摇晃的厉害（当时并不止地震发生在汶川），我急忙跑了下楼，到六点钟再回酒店时已关闭，但酒店还派了工作人员陪我一起上房间拿了行李并由总经理亲自驾车送我和同事去了他们的另一家酒店。唯一觉得不好的是舍不得开冷气，不过还是我在南充的不二之选。,"Every time I arrived in Nanchong, I lived here. This time I was a bit special. At that time, I lived in the Wenchuan earthquake on the twelfth floor.The hotel was closed, but the hotel also sent the staff to accompany me to the room to get my luggage and drive me and my colleagues to another hotel with my colleagues.The only thing I feel bad is to reluctant to turn on air, but I am the best choice in Nanchong."
1,一，房间舒适卫生，且较为宽敞（豪华标间）。二，酒店服务还可以。三，所处地理位置极佳。强烈推荐！,"First, the room is comfortable and hygienic, and it is relatively spacious (luxury bid room).Second, hotel service is okay.Third, the geographical location is excellent.highly recommended!"
1,"刚刚从海天回来,住的东楼15楼的标房,窗户很大,坐在窗边朝左是海景,朝右是山景,海天酒店夹在东海路和香港西路之间,风景很是不错.如果选择住在香港路附近的,这家无疑是窗外景色最美的了.床和枕头都挺舒服的,厕所有些旧,但是热水很稳定,打开就有(人家是五星级的好不好!)15%的服务费贵了点,入住的时候你自己去找自己的房间,行李更是没有人管,这点有些愧对那么贵的服务费了.门童给叫得TAXI一律起步费10+1元，建议大家不要坐。自己走几步去街上叫，起步费8元。电视机是在是小了一点，大概才18寸的样子。离开前一个晚上会送2块小饼干，和一朵小野花。。。呵呵，酒店的吃的倒是不贵，就是+15%的服务费就有点。。。。。。总体来说还是很不错的选择。去各个景点都很方便，机场的巴士半小时一班就在酒店后门，没事在房间里发呆还可以看海，700块一个晚上。","I just returned from Haitian. The benchmarking room on the 15th floor of the East Tower, the windows are very large. Sitting on the left is the sea view, and the right is a mountain view.Yes. If you choose to live near Hong Kong Road, this one is undoubtedly the most beautiful scenery outside the window. The beds and pillows are very comfortable, the toilet is old, but the hot water is very stable.OK!) 15%of the service fee is a bit expensive. When you stay in, you go to your own room, and no one cares about your luggage. This is a bit ashamed of such a expensive service fee. Gate Tong will start to make TAXI.It costs 10+1 yuan, it is recommended that you do not sit.Take a few steps to call on the street, starting at 8 yuan.The TV is a little smaller, which is about 18 inches.A small biscuits will be sent one night before leaving, and a small wild flower.EssenceEssenceHehe, the hotel's food is not expensive, that is,+15%of the service fee is a bit.EssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceOverall is a very good choice.It is very convenient to go to various attractions. The bus at the airport is at the back door of the hotel for half an hour. It is okay to see the sea in a daze in the room. 700 yuan a night."
1,"酒店房间不大,但比较干净整洁,早餐还不错,特别是小馄饨很香,服务员很热情,唯一不足的是酒店地处包头步行街,外面的商店音响很吵.","The hotel room is not large, but it is relatively clean and tidy. The breakfast is not bad, especially the small ravioli is very fragrant. The waiter is very enthusiastic. The only disadvantage is that the hotel is located in Baotou Pedestrian Street. The audio outside the shop is very noisy."
1,地点非常好，购物方便。店内布置较温馨，早餐不错，房间干净，服务态度也好。缺点就是不隔音，房门就跟没有一样，楼道的动静全能听见，望能改进。,"The location is very good and the shopping is convenient.The shop is more warm, breakfast is good, the room is clean, and the service attitude is good.The disadvantage is that it is not sounding, and the door of the room is the same. The movement of the corridor can be heard, and it can be improved."
1,住过许多次的小宾馆了，离地铁4号站只有100米，非常方便外出。至于设施嘛，200元内的也不可能好到哪去，但还算干净和一应惧全，网络是免费宽带。,"The small hotels that have stayed many times, only 100 meters away from Metro Station, are very convenient to go out.As for the facilities, it is not possible to get better within 200 yuan, but it is still clean and fearful. The network is free broadband."
1,房间比较宽敞，有网线，不错，总体上感觉可以，房间服务生态度认真，前台服务态度需提高，所在地理位置不是很好，出租车司机基本不熟，打车从浦东机场到这里要了我170~不过在上海这么贵的地方，这个宾馆还是相当超值的~,"The room is relatively spacious, there are network cables, good, generally feel, the room service is serious, the front desk service attitude needs to be improved, the geographical location is not very good, the taxi driver is basically unfamiliar.~ But in such a expensive place in Shanghai, this hotel is still quite good ~"

1,该酒店是沧州目前最好成绩的酒店.早餐还可以.房间也不错.不过就周围没有娱乐和购物地方...出门不是很方便,The hotel is the best hotel in Cangzhou. Breakfast is okay. The room is also good.
1,酒店门口的路修好了，客房也装修好了，感觉非常不错~~~！新装修的客房比原来的要好很多，很上档次，还赠送很多东西呢~~~比起那个柳州饭店好多了。酒店服务员也很热情~！以后来柳州都住这里。宾馆反馈2008年8月11日：非常感谢您对我酒店的支持与肯定！期待您的下次光临：）,"The road at the entrance of the hotel was repaired, and the rooms were renovated. It felt very good ~~~!The newly renovated rooms are much better than the original, very high -grade, and given a lot of things ~~~ It is much better than that Liuzhou Hotel.The hotel waiter is also very enthusiastic ~!In the future, Liuzhou will live here.Hotel feedback on August 11, 2008: Thank you very much for your support and affirmation of our hotel!Looking forward to your next visit :)"
1,"住的豪华房,房间很大，但其实没什么必要,基本活动范围都在标准床这边,装修有点老，早餐很不错.总的来说下次还是可以去住的.服务不错.要是硬件再好点就太棒了.宾馆反馈2008年8月1日：谢谢您的支持！硬件方面，我们已经对客房重新进行了装修，性价比很高，期待您的光临！再次感谢您对我们的支持与厚爱！","The luxurious room where the room is large, but in fact, there is no necessary. The scope of basic activities is on the standard bed. The decoration is a bit old, and the breakfast is very good. In general, you can still live. The service is good.Good better. Hotel feedback on August 1, 2008: Thank you for your support!In terms of hardware, we have renovated the rooms, and the cost performance is very high. Looking forward to your visit!Thank you again for your support and love for us!"
1,酒店设施不错，价格比较适中，下次还住这家酒店宾馆反馈2008年8月1日：感谢一如既往的支持！期待您再次光临！,"The hotel facilities are good and the price is relatively moderate. Next time, I will stay in this hotel and hotel feedback on August 1, 2008: Thank you for your support!Looking forward to your visit again!"
1,房间挺大，设施也还好用，但装修很差，窗台部分墙壁的壁纸都脱落了，很难看。卫生间比较简陋，但各种用具都还能正常使用。,"The room is quite large, and the facilities are also good, but the decoration is very poor. The wallpapers on the walls of the window sill have fallen off, and it is difficult to see.The bathroom is relatively simple, but all kinds of utensils can still be used normally."
1,"房间非常大,我住的大床房,床有1.8米宽,热水很大,洗澡舒服,洗脸盆也大，可洗衣服了．早晨没什么吃的,服务还行,没什么特别,入住时给我的房卡忘记在电脑上做过,我上去发现打不开,只能再下楼,小姑娘连句道歉都没有,看来要加强培训.马路正对面有家川菜小饭店,价廉物美,量还大,有空调,边上的阿牛饺子馅大，不贵，味不错．老板人非常好，我手机忘在桌子上，马上亲自送出来．酒店位置还行，到青岛路步行街不远","The room is very large. I live in a large bed room. The bed is 1.8 meters wide, the hot water is very large, the bath is comfortable, the washbasin is also large, but I can wash clothes.There is nothing to eat in the morning, the service is okay, there is nothing special. I forgot to do the room card I have forgotten on the computer when I check -in. I went up and found that I couldn't open it. I could only go downstairs.Strengthening training. There is a small restaurant in front of the road opposite the road. It is cheap and good, with large quantities, air -conditioning, and Aiu Niu Gow is large, not expensive, good.The boss is very good. My mobile phone forgets it on the table and immediately send it out.The hotel location is still, not far from Qingdao Road Pedestrian Street"
1,这个价钱来说，还是可以了，比较干净，特别是被褥，很干净没有异味。上网还可以，速度不是很快，但凑活用用可以了。电话很差，根本没法打电话，全部是噪声，联络只能靠手机，漫游贵啊~~楼下的饭店味道还可以，价钱在当地有点小贵，但是量极其的大，切记,"At this price, it is still okay, relatively clean, especially the bedding, very clean and without odor.The Internet is okay, the speed is not very fast, but it is okay to use it.The phone is very poor, and you ca n’t call at all. It is all noise. You can only rely on your mobile phone. You are expensive. The restaurant downstairs is okay. The price is a bit expensive in the local area, but the amount is extremely large."
1,距离火车站颇远，洗浴的地方设计不太合理，水会流到马桶周围形成积水。卫生中上，前台的小姐态度很好，会告诉你你要去的地方的大概距离，时间和大概打车费。,"Far away from the railway station, the design of the bathing place is not reasonable, and the water will flow around the toilet to form accumulated water.In hygiene, the lady in the front desk is very good, and it will tell you about the approximate distance, time and about taxi fees where you are going."
1,在当地算是家不错的宾馆，交通方便，离闹市区不远，对面就是大超市，用餐方便，宾馆2楼和周围的小店味道都可以。,It is a good hotel in the local area. It is convenient for transportation and not far from the downtown area. It is a big supermarket on the opposite side. It is convenient for meals. The taste of the second floor and the surrounding shops can taste.
1,拿房时没大床房了，给我们免费升成套房，这点还蛮满意的。酒店大致不错，有国内五星水准。比国际品牌的要差一点。酒店有点年纪了，维修要加强，比如我们浴室的下水就堵塞不通，这些在客人入住前就该发觉修好。其它都还可以。,"There is no big bed room when I take the room, and it is quite satisfactory for us to be promoted to a suite for free.The hotel is roughly good and has the standard of five -star in China.It's worse than international brands.The hotel is a bit older, and the maintenance should be strengthened. For example, the launch of our bathroom is not blocked. These should be found to be repaired before the guests move in.Everything else is okay."
1,三星级的硬件，五星级的服务。服务真的没话说。离解放碑还是稍微远了一点，没有想象的近。不能用走的，还得打车。打车到只要5块钱。地段设施也只是过得去，但是它的服务能让我们两个在外面漂泊了一个多礼拜并且饱受重庆插头司机拒载之苦的异乡游客感动得惊天动地。细节决定成败这句话真没错。首先，凡事打车到达酒店或是从酒店出发的客人，门童不但负责开门拿行李以外，还会及时将该车的车牌号抄在一张小卡片上交给客人。以防客人遗失物品在出租车上。（貌似重庆插头没有给发票的习惯）酒店checkin的柜台是低柜，客人和前台小姐都是坐着得，感觉非常亲切。虽然是自助早餐，但是你只要对服务员说一声你要的鸡蛋是什么样的，保管五分钟内热乎乎的给你端上来，而且绝对不会搞错老嫩单双。自助早餐的质量也比我们住的成都的一家类似价格的号称四星的酒店好多了。房间里的拖鞋是那种厚厚的棉质的，不是纸头做的一次性的。卫生间里配有可收缩的晾衣绳。洗手液取代小肥皂，外加一包手洗洗衣粉。对出行有任何疑问只要致电总台就能得到详尽的答案。我们的古怪问题包括附,"Three -star hardware, five -star service.The service is really nothing to say.It was a little farther away from the liberated monument, not as close as imagined.You can't use it, you have to take a taxi.It takes only 5 yuan to take a taxi.List facilities are just passing, but its services can make the two of us wandering outside for more than a week and have been moved by a foreign tourist who is suffering from Chongqing's plug -in driver's refusal.The details determine the success or failure.First of all, when you take a taxi to the hotel or the guests departing from the hotel, the door children will not only be responsible for opening the door to pick up their luggage, but also copy the license plate number of the car in a small card to the guests in time.In order to prevent the lost items on the taxi.(It seems that Chongqing's plug does not give an invoice.) The counter of the hotel Checkin is a low cabinet. The guests and the front desk lady are sitting, and they feel very kind.Although it is a buffet breakfast, as long as you say to the waiter what the egg you want is like, keep it on you in five minutes, and you will never get the old tender single and double.The quality of buffet breakfast is also much better than a similar price of a similar price of a similar price in Chengdu where we live.The slippers in the room are that kind of thick cotton, not a disposable one of the paper head.The bathroom is equipped with a shrinkable clothes rope.Hand washing solution replaced small soap, plus a pack of hand washing powder.If you have any questions about travel, you can get detailed answers as long as you call the main station.Our weird issue includes attached"
1,优点：1、与我住过的其他酒店相比，早餐是我非常满意的自助餐，非常丰富的中餐及西餐，而且携程订是含餐的，非常不错。2、房间内的拖鞋档次和质量也非常好3、房间的淋浴的水非常大，洗澡很爽的！4、地处沈阳的步行街――中街，购物和吃饭都很方便缺点：1、价格还不算太贵，能接受，但房间却是没有窗户的！很让人郁闷的。2、淋浴水大，但下水很不好的！3、电视机放的柜子是老式的，有两个可关的门折叠着，但可上网的桌子与电视柜是平行的，所以上网就根本看不到电视，因为那折叠的门是多出来的。补充点评2008年7月24日：还有就是上网，太差了。每一次上网不是自动获取网址的，而是要填房间号和密码，最让人郁闷的就是一会时间后再点其他网址的话就还要再次输入房间号和密码，太烦了！！！！,"Advantages: 1. Compared with other hotels I have lived, breakfast is my very satisfactory buffet, very rich Chinese and western food, and Ctrip Order is contained in meals, which is very good.2. The grade and quality of the slippers in the room are also very good. 3. The shower in the room is very large, and the bath is very cool!4. Located on the pedestrian street of Shenyang -Zhongjie, shopping and eating are very convenient disadvantages: 1. The price is not too expensive, acceptable, but the room has no windows!Very depressed.2. The shower water is large, but the water is not good!3. The cabinet placed on the TV is old -fashioned. There are two customs door folding, but the tables that can be used online are parallel to the TV cabinet, so you can't see TV at all, because the folding door is more out of the door.of.Supplementary comment on July 24, 2008: There is also the Internet, which is too bad.Every time I go online, it is not to automatically obtain the URL, but to fill in the room number and password. The most depressed thing is that if you order it for a while, you need to enter the room number and password again. It is too annoying!IntersectionIntersectionIntersection"
1,离故宫不太远，走路大概10分钟不到点，环境还好，有一点非常不好的是窗帘就只有一层，早上很早就被刺眼的阳光给折腾醒了，郁闷```,It is not too far from the Forbidden City. It is less than 10 minutes walking. The environment is okay. One of the very bad things is that the curtains are only one layer. I was woken up by the dazzling sun in the morning.
1,优点：从自驾车游客吃住的角度看，此“宾馆”已经很不错了。干净、宽敞、自助餐也不错，最大优势是距离景点非常近，开车几分钟就到。缺点：与绝大部分宾馆酒店一样，室内空气污染情况都比较重（不过还可以忍受）。去前如不做好功课，找起来略有困难。,"Advantages: From the perspective of self -driving tourists, this ""hotel"" is already very good.Clean, spacious, and buffets are also good. The biggest advantage is that the distance is very close to the attractions, and it takes a few minutes to drive.Disadvantages: Like most hotels and hotels, indoor air pollution is relatively heavy (but to endure).If you do n’t do your homework before you go, it is slightly difficult to find."
1,我们入住的三人间房间很大，床也很大，设施很好。餐厅是自助餐，28元一位，感觉还不错。宾馆的院子里还有一个运动场，有健身器材，晚饭后在那里散散步，很惬意。,"The three -person room we stayed in was large, the bed was very large, and the facilities were very good.The restaurant is buffet, 28 yuan, it feels pretty good.There is also a sports field in the hotel's yard, with fitness equipment. It is very pleasant to walk there after dinner."
1,没想到江阴这么小的地方有这么好的酒店，真的不错，定的是豪华标间，房间很大，便于加床，没想到加的床也很舒服，卫生间很大，有浴缸和淋浴房，很干净，值得推荐。早餐也很不错。,"I did not expect that there were such a good hotel in such a small place in Jiangyin. It was really good. The luxury room was set. The room was large and it was easy to add bed. I did not expect that the bed was very comfortable., Very clean and recommended.Breakfast is also very good."
1,"我住的1113号房门窗的密封性有问题,一个晚上风声鹤立,一宿没停,望酒店尽快查明原因",I live in the sealing nature of Room 1113. There is a problem with the wind of the wind for a night.
1,总体来说，价格公道，服务和设施都不错，出差商住比较理想，干净、清静、方便、舒适。但是也有不尽如人意的地方，例如我进入房间后发现，装修的榔头和木板竟然还在地上，不过及时更换了房间。下去吃饭，竟然一个位置都没有，不是住店客人太多，而是大厅和包房全让结婚包场的和请客吃饭的占了。试问：一个5星酒店，怎么说也要为住店客人留个大厅用餐吧，不能对着每个客人说：先生，麻烦您去我们西餐厅或是日餐厅吧？,"Generally speaking, the price is fair, the services and facilities are good, and the business and residence of business are ideal, clean, quiet, convenient, and comfortable.But there are also unsatisfactory places. For example, after I entered the room, I found that the decorative hammers and wooden boards were still on the ground, but the room was replaced in time.After eating, there is no place in one place. It is not that there are too many guests who live in the store, but the lobby and rooms are all occupied by the wedding searches and the invitation to dinner.I would like to ask: A 5 -star hotel, how can I leave a lobby for the guests in the store, do n’t say to every guest: Sir, please go to our western restaurant or Japanese dining room?"
1,条件、服务、设施都很好，房间很干净、很舒适，尤其是前台服务态度很好。房间很大、床很宽，暖气很足，热水也很大。下次去还会住！,"The conditions, services, and facilities are very good. The rooms are clean and comfortable, especially the front desk service attitude is very good.The room is large, the bed is wide, the heating is enough, and the hot water is very large.I will live next time!"
1,"酒店位置优越~房间干净~前台服务一般~结帐时有点慢,酒店周边环境不错,1层的桑拿超好~下次来西宁首选这家酒店!!!","The hotel is superior ~ the room is clean ~ The front desk service is a bit slow when checkout, the surrounding environment of the hotel is good, the 1 -floor sauna is super good ~ next time I will choose this hotel for the next time !!!"
1,酒店所处的地理位置优越，无论是交通、吃、购物都非常方便，特别直的推荐的是在酒店的二楼及周边方圆几百米就有多家的美食餐厅^*^^*^就算入住再久，也不必担心会吃腻，房间空间虽小还有点残旧，总体还算干净和清静，值得推荐入住。,"The hotel is located with excellent geographical location. It is very convenient for transportation, eating, and shopping. It is particularly recommended that there are many gourmet restaurants on the second floor of the hotel on the second floor and the surrounding area.For a long time, you don't have to worry about getting tired. Although the room space is small, it is still a bit old. The overall is still clean and quiet, and it is worth recommending check -in."
1,"好的方面:-位置好,靠近蛇口码头,海上世界旅游休闲区;-设计独特,房间给人家的亲近感,更适合较长时间旅行的停顿,前台别致(两张桌子象银行大堂经理位);待改善的方面:-价格偏贵,直逼五星级;-早餐一般,物无所值.免费注册网站导航宾馆索引服","Good aspects: -The location is good, close to Shekou Wharf, maritime world tourism and leisure area;Aspects to be improved: -The price is expensive, close to five-star;"
1,房间装修可以，隔音不太好。早餐不尽如人意，有烤面包，但没有黄油。西式早餐没有煎培根。,"The room decoration is possible, and the sound insulation is not good.Breakfast is not satisfactory, there are grilled bread, but there is no butter.Western -style breakfast has no fried bacon."
1,酒店员工的外语水平需要加强，和外宾交流不畅，其他的服务还是不错的！,"The level of foreign language of hotel employees needs to be strengthened, and the communication with foreign guests is not smooth. Other services are still good!"
1,"房间还算敞亮,服务也符合三星级旧点水平。而且到五台山也只有2小时路程，价格比五台山那里便宜一半。很合算的酒店！","The room is pretty bright, and the service is in line with the old level of Samsung.And there is only a 2 -hour journey to Wutai Mountain, and the price is half cheaper than Wutai Mountain.Very cost -effective hotel!"
1,服务是一流的，进去就有人端茶送水，还帮着打伞，他家的姜茶确实很好喝！通过携城订的房，但是好像携城和酒店沟通有问题，查了半天都没有查到我们的预定。毕竟是超5星酒店，还是二话没说帮我们尽快安排了，还免费升级到了藏式小屋。不知道是不是因为没有事先预定好，没有空的牧舍了？？？不管怎样心中窃喜～～对于酒店的设施和服务就不再多夸了，有些小地方还想提一下：1、大部分菜单和说明都是英文的，没有中文。本想下次带老妈也来享受享受，想想算了，她老人家可是看不懂这些abc的。2、房间太大了，由于现在还挺冷，虽然3、4个空调一起开，还是稍微有点冷。,"The service is first -class. When you go in, someone will bring tea and send water, and help to make an umbrella. His domestic tea is really delicious!Through the house ordered the house, it seems that there are problems with the city and the hotel, and we have not found our booking for a long time.After all, it was a super 5 -star hotel, but I didn't say that it would help us arrange it as soon as possible, and it was upgraded to the Tibetan hut for free.I don't know if it was because there was no preparation in advance, and there was no time to be empty?IntersectionIntersectionNo matter what you feel, you don't exaggerate the hotel's facilities and services. Some small places also want to mention: 1. Most of the menu and description are English, without Chinese.I wanted to take my mother to enjoy it next time. Think about it, but her old man couldn't understand these ABCs.2. The room is too big, because it is quite cold now, although 3 or 4 air conditioners are turned on together, it is still a little cold."
1,我是在全国雪灾时来到了仁安悦榕庄的，整个酒店就我们一个住户，酒店座落在藏民的村落中，与自然环境融为一体，我看到的是一个白色的童话世界，酒店工作人员及总经理何满先生都相当的亲切，怕大雪封山，酒店派了最好的藏族司机：扎西，第二天一早送我们回了丽江，而他自己连着就回香格里拉，等于要开一天的路（早上８点３０出发，他到晚上９点才到）而,"I came to Renan Banyan Tree during the snow disaster across the country. The entire hotel is a resident of us. The hotel is located in the village of Tibetans.Mr. He Man, the hotel staff and general manager, are quite kind. I am afraid that the snow seal the mountain. The hotel sent the best Tibetan driver: Tashi, who sent us back to Lijiang the next morning, and he returned to Shangri -La himself in a row.It is equivalent to opening a day (departing at 8:30 in the morning, and he until 9 o'clock in the evening)"
1,房间、环境都不错，缺点：山上指示牌比够清晰，房间蚊虫较多。最差的是越王河漂流，可称为“史上最差漂流”，河中垃圾成堆，又无半点风景可言。,"The rooms and environment are good, and the disadvantages: the signs on the mountain are clear enough, and there are more mosquitoes in the room.The worst is the River River River River, which can be called ""the worst drifting in history"". The garbage in the river is piled up, and there is no landscape at all."
1,我是在国庆期间入住的，入住的前一天在御临门温泉度过，非常多人，因此心想在越王山也别指望太幽静了，谁知到达后发现并非如此，这里没有像其他景点黄金周人山人海的场面，十分舒服！山庄的环境、服务、房间如其他人评论一样，在此不再罗嗦，值得推荐！由于预先没有准备，只呆了一天，期望能再次前往。,"I stayed during the National Day. I spent the day I stayed in the Yulinmen Hot Spring the day before I stayed. Many people, so I want to do n’t expect too quiet in Yuewangshan. Who knows that it is not the case after arriving?The scene of Zhou Renshan people is very comfortable!The environment, services, and rooms of the villa are like other people's comments. They are no longer verbal, and it is worth recommending!Because I was not prepared in advance, I stayed for a day and expected to go again."
1,商务大床房的房间不错，卫生间较大，不错不错！下次还会住！就是有一只该死的蚊子缠了我一晚上！,"The room in the large business bed room is good, the bathroom is large, good and good!I will live next time!There was a damn mosquito entangled me all night!"
1,不多，性价比很好，房间内的设施也很好，就是早餐种类好像少了点。,"Not much, the price is good, and the facilities in the room are also very good, that is, the type of breakfast seems to be a little less."
1,我每次通过携程出去旅游，这次入住这家酒店让我比较满意，房间装修，内部设备都比较人性化，298元/间大床房性价比挺高，周边环境也很宜人，应该讲是不错的，提两点意见：前台服务小姐态度还有待于跟进；2、早餐确实挺单一。希望改进，生意会更好。,"Every time I go out through Ctrip, I am satisfied with this hotel this hotel. The room decoration and internal equipment are more user -friendly.In this way, two points of opinion: The attitude of the front desk service lady has to follow up; 2. The breakfast is indeed very single.Hope to improve, business will be better."
1,"我入住是南楼,房间确实是小,但娱乐设施方面比较丰富,人工湖很大,人造沙滩也比较吸引.早餐产品品种丰富,总的来说推出套票形式还是物超所值的.","I stay in the South Tower. The room is indeed small, but the entertainment facilities are relatively rich, the artificial lake is large, and the artificial beach is also more attractive. Breakfast products are rich in variety. In general, the form of packages is worthy of money."
1,"本次是我与家人第2次到此酒店渡假，去年第一次是住南楼，房间太小，感觉不大好，这次加100元升级到主楼的高级房，感觉比南楼好多了，完全不同的感受！这次吃、住、玩、环境都不错，价钱也不贵，酒店游乐项目丰富，观光电梯不错小朋友很喜欢，人工沙滩有特色，仙湖很大且风景很好，踩脚踏船一个小时都不能走个来回，乒乓球、桌球室环境都不错，主楼游泳池水上乐园小孩子玩得很高兴！酒店的沐足中心手法不错，价格也合理。酒店服务尚好，服务人员有礼貌。家人朋友都玩得十分尽兴，很超值！不足的是：儿童(超出1.4米)车位费不能全免,自助早餐儿童没有任何优惠,按成人价全价收费。若儿童车位全免,儿童自助早餐半价优惠,那一家人短期去渡假就是很好的选择！","This time is the second time I went to the hotel with my family. The first time I lived in the South Tower last year. The room was too small and it felt not good. This time, it was not good to upgrade to the main building. It feels much better than the South Tower., Completely different feelings!This time, it is good to eat, live, play, and the environment, and the price is not expensive. The hotel amusement project is rich. The sightseeing elevator is good.Can't go back and forth, the table tennis and billiard room environment is good. The children of the main building swimming pool water park are very happy!The hotel's foot center is good and the price is reasonable.The hotel service is good, and the service staff is polite.Family and friends have fun, very good value for money!The shortcoming is that the parking fee of children (over 1.4 meters) cannot be exempted, and there are no discounts for children with buffet breakfast, and charges are charged at full price at the adult price.If children's parking spaces are free, children's buffet breakfast semi -price discounts, and that family is a good choice to take a vacation in the short term!"
1,已经几次入住悦华，很不错的酒店，服务态度相当的好，其实距离也还好，打车去中山路购物街什么的也就20块钱。,I have been in Yuehua several times. The hotel is very good. The service attitude is quite good.
1,非常喜欢酒店的服务，我第一次来提了好多意见，比如开夜床没有点心，等等，结果第二天客房就送来点心了。非常感动。第二次入住时，前台竟然认出我来，说欢迎我入住。感到很温馨。很喜欢这家酒店。前台的笑容很真诚。,"I like the service of the hotel very much. For the first time, I brought a lot of opinions, such as the night bed without snacks, and so on. As a result, the room was sent to the room the next day.very touched.During the second time I stayed, I recognized me at the front desk and said I was welcome to stay in.Feel very warm.I like this hotel very much.The smile on the front desk is very sincere."
1,住的是行政楼层，行政酒廊的餐食很好。服务很好，小姐总是面带微笑。房间很舒适。玩乒乓球免费。酒店地处购物中心，放便逛街。室外的游泳池较小，能闻到厨房的油烟味道。,"I live in the administrative floor, and the meals of the administrative lounge are very good.The service is very good, the lady always smiles.The room is very comfortable.Play table tennis for free.The hotel is located in a shopping mall and goes shopping.The outdoor swimming pool is small and can smell the oil fume of the kitchen."
1,厦门海景千禧大酒店就是以前的海景假日皇冠大酒店，现在中方自己管理，虽然现在没星，但各方面都不错。,"The Xiamen Sea View Millennium Hotel is the former Sea Voluals Holiday Crown Hotel. Now it is managed by the Chinese side. Although there is no star now, it is good in all aspects."
1,端午节期间去厦门自助游，选择入住了这里，酒店挂牌4星，我个人感觉是一家质量相当好的酒店，房价设备特别是床和淋浴都很不错，服务也比较好。遗憾的是电视机实在太过陈旧，和整个酒店不协调。希望可以改进，总体还是推荐这家酒店的。,"During the Dragon Boat Festival, I went to Xiamen to self -guided tour and chose to stay here. The hotel was listed in 4 stars. I personally felt that it was a very good hotel. House prices, especially beds and showers, were very good, and the service was better.Unfortunately, the TV is too old and is not coordinated with the entire hotel.I hope it can be improved, and this hotel is recommended."
1,地段不错，比较闹中取静的，就是出租车比较难叫，好在门口的服务员会帮你叫，总体感觉不错，房间也比较大,"The location is good, and those who are more quiet are that taxis are more difficult to call. Fortunately, the waiter at the door will help you. Overall feels good, and the room is relatively large."
1,入住的主要原因是方便。机场巴士就在楼下，适合短暂停留，不适合常住。周围没什么我喜欢的吃饭的地方。拐到后面一条路上，有家粥店不错。ps：上网速度还行,"The main reason for check -in is convenient.The airport bus is downstairs, suitable for short -term stays, not suitable for staying.There is nothing I like to eat.Turning on the back of the road, there is a porridge shop.PS: Internet speed is okay"
1,可能是电费的问题，房间里的空调不够热，如在平原，只能算3星，但在香格里拉可以算4星。补充点评2007年4月3日：是商务标准间,"It may be the problem of electricity bills. The air conditioner in the room is not hot enough. If in the plain, it can only be counted as 3 stars, but it can be counted as 4 stars in Shangri -La.Supplementary comment on April 3, 2007: It is the business standard room"
1,"通过携程定的豪华标间却很幸运的给我免费升级为最顶级的豪华套房,非常舒适.另外他们的商务标间非常不错是新装修的很喜欢,充满简洁现代的风格","Through Ctrip's luxury standard room, I was lucky to upgrade to the top luxury suite for free, which is very comfortable. In addition, their business standard rooms are very good."
1,非常满意，服务很亲切，我们都很喜欢乐园的房间．补充点评2008年8月15日：晚上在酒店西餐吃的，有点贵，还没吃饱，第二天早上我们没吃，是去迪士尼乐园皇室餐厅把早餐午餐一起解决的，皇室餐厅真的不错，份量足，而且不难吃．,"Very satisfied, the service is very kind, we all like the room of the park.Supplementary comment on August 15, 2008: I ate it in the hotel in the hotel in the evening. It was a bit expensive and had not been full. The next morning we didn't eat it. I went to the Disneyland Royal Restaurant to solve the breakfast and lunch together. The royal restaurant was really good., Full of weight, and not difficult to eat."
1,我非常喜欢的酒店，酒店服务很周到，和孩子去玩也像自己回到童年，酒店房间很不错也很合理，只是在酒店吃饭时感觉吃饭的时间有点紧张，孩子和大人的好去处，希望下次去不要下雨，这次去住两天感觉有点少，下次和家人还会再次入住。,"I like the hotel very much, the hotel service is very thoughtful, and I play with my children like my own childhood. The hotel room is very good and reasonable. I just feel that I feel a little nervous when eating in the hotel. The children and adults are good. I hopeDo n’t rain next time. I feel a little bit less to live for two days this time, and next time I will stay with my family again."
1,酒店下午3点才能入住，上午11点就要退房，有点不公平啊，好在行李寄存服务还周到，让我们在迪士尼玩得还是很开心。早餐太贵，成人198元一位，儿童100元一位，如果想用餐还需预订，酒店除了迪士尼的纪念品外没有吃的东西可买，好在我们在入住的时候准备了许多吃的，以免让孩子受饿。酒店的设施还是挺好，床也挺大，有孩子的拖鞋和睡衣，考虑很周到。酒店有游泳池网球场等设施，可惜光顾着在迪士尼公园玩都没有好好享受酒店的这些设施。住酒店可以在迪士尼游玩两天，这还是挺好的，让我们的迪士尼之行没有那么匆忙。,"The hotel can only stay at 3 pm, and check out at 11 am. It is a bit unfair. Fortunately, the luggage storage service is still thoughtful, letting us play with Disney very happy.Breakfast is too expensive, adults are 198 yuan per person and 100 yuan for children. If you want to dine, you need to book it. You can buy it except Disney's souvenirs.Make your child hungry.The hotel's facilities are still very good, and the beds are quite large. There are children's slippers and pajamas. It is very thoughtful.The hotel has facilities such as the swimming pool tennis court. Unfortunately, I patronized these facilities of the hotel without playing in Disney Park.You can play in Disney for two days. This is still very good, so that our Disney trip is not so hurried."
1,暑假入住，小朋友太多了。我们每天都被走廊上奔跑的小朋友吵醒，晚上回酒店大堂里也都是小朋友的喧闹声。所以情侣还是不要在暑假入住这家酒店了。酒店的餐厅很贵不好吃，和迪斯尼里面差不多。可惜，这次在香港都没有吃到美食。但酒店整体还是非常可爱的风格，让我们回到了童话世界。,"Stay in the summer vacation, there are too many children.We are awakened by children running on the corridor every day, and they are full of noise of children in the hotel lobby at night.So couples should not stay in this hotel in the summer vacation.The restaurant in the hotel is very expensive or delicious, similar to Disney.Unfortunately, I did not eat food in Hong Kong this time.But the hotel as a whole is still very cute, let us return to the fairy tale world."
1,非常满意，服务贴心到位，还主动把携程的预定门票换成门票，我们可以不排队。房间干净整洁，还很漂亮，很赞的,"Very satisfied, intimate service, and actively replacing Ctrip's scheduled tickets with tickets, we can not line up.The room is clean and tidy, still beautiful, very good"
1,房间还算可以，但硬件设施偏差，服务水平也很一般。,"The room is okay, but the deviation of the hardware facilities and the service level are very general."
1,"上网免费，速度也没想像中的慢；当天送新鲜水果，那个桃真甜；会提前联系客户，确认接站信息；单人房，床大小还算中等；房间紧凑，没有书桌，但在浴室发现有吹风机，还有点小惊喜，毕竟才150嘛；总体感觉蛮好，会推荐朋友入住。补充点评2008年8月8日：看到其他驴友的点评，想起来他们的接客的车，的确是蛮新的私家车，但是包车的价格也的确不能跟差头同日而语，虽然被我还掉了些，但是跟市场平均价相比还是贵了，当然一分车况一分价钱也是能理解的。最令人恼火的是，我们是二位包车的，上午去莫高窟也没什么，到了下午去鸣沙山，想给另外二位朋友搭个顺风车，司机陆师傅竟然说要加钱，我很奇怪，难道我们包车价格只含二人吗，同样是载人，载二个和载四个不是一样吗，也没有超员现象，人就不能增加吗？后来在我一再拒绝加钱的情况下，陆师傅似乎同意让我们同伴一起乘车了，由于其他原因最终我们同伴也没搭这趟顺风车。后来到晚上大家从鸣沙山玩好，想一起乘车回市区，那个陆师傅又开始拒绝同伴搭车了，还说这是公司规定，我很纳闷，去的时候同意一起载，怎么到回来的时候又变卦，害我们在同伴面前好没面子，唉，让我感觉接车的服务也不是那么好享受的了。宾馆反馈2008年8月8日：感谢您对本宾馆的点评和肯定,关于旅游包车一事,特向您作一解释:因为您在包车之前说明是两人包车的,所以本宾馆只为两位各购买了二十万的意外保险.如果您的朋友在中途要搭您的顺风车,本宾馆也是站在您的立场考虑,而未让您的朋友搭车.如果在搭车途中万一发生意外,本宾馆不好向您交代,想必您也无法向您的朋友交代.所以本宾馆规定:包车时必须事先说明是几个人,本宾馆会提前为您们购买保险!如在中途增加人员,本宾馆主要从安全角度考虑是不可以的.如给您带来的不便,再次向您道歉,并请您原谅!希望您下次再来敦煌的时候,本宾馆会给您更加优质的服务!","The Internet is free, and the speed is not as slow as you think; the fresh fruit was given that day, the peach is really sweet; you will contact the customer in advance to confirm the pick -up information;There are hair dryers and a little surprise. After all, it is only 150; the overall feels pretty good, I will recommend friends to stay.Supplementary comment on August 8, 2008: Seeing the reviews of other donkey friends, remembering that their pick -up cars are indeed a new private car, but the price of chartered cars can indeed not be on the same day as the difference.It has been lost, but it is still expensive compared to the average price of the market. Of course, the price of one car is also understandable.The most annoying thing is that we are two chartered cars, and there is nothing to go to Mogao Grottoes in the morning. In the afternoon, I went to Mingsha Mountain and wanted to take a ride of two other friends.It is strange. Do we only include two people in the chartered car? It is also a manpate. Is n’t two and four two the same, and there is no superposition, can people not increase?Later, when I repeatedly refused to increase money, Master Lu seemed to agree to let our companions ride together. In other reasons, our companions did not take this ride.Later, in the evening, everyone played well from Mingsha Mountain and wanted to take a car back to the city together. The master Lu began to refuse his companion to take a ride. He also said that this was the company's regulations.When we change the hexagrams, it hurts us in front of our companions. Alas, it makes me feel that the service of picking up the car is not so enjoyable.Hotel feedback on August 8, 2008: Thank you for your comment and affirmation of the hotel. Regarding the travel charter, you will explain to you: Because you explained that you are chartered by the two before charter, so the hotel is only two of them for two.I bought an accident insurance of 200,000. If your friend wants to take your ride in the middle of the road, the hotel is also considering your standpoint, but you will not let your friends take a ride.The hotel is not good to explain to you, and you must not be able to explain to your friends. Therefore, this hotel stipulates that it must be explained in advance when chartered the car.It is impossible to consider from the perspective of security. If the inconvenience brings you, I will apologize to you again, and please forgive me! I hope that when you come to Dunhuang next time, the hotel will give you better service!"
1,"酒店环境不错，离沙洲夜市不远。酒店服务不错，在敦煌这座小城市算是可以接受。宾馆反馈2008年8月7日：感谢您对本宾馆的点评,本宾馆将以更优质的服务期待您的再次光临!","The hotel environment is good, not far from the Shazhou Night Market.The hotel service is good, and it is acceptable in the small city in Dunhuang.Hotel feedback on August 7, 2008: Thank you for your comment on the hotel.

1,"我也是看了网上的点评以后才订的这家宾馆,看到点评上有好的,也有不好的,这次自己亲身体验了一下,也写一下自己的感受.宾馆总体感觉很好,大厅温馨,看到了自己的名字在欢迎牌上,很亲切;房间也很整洁,我住的房间,设施设备都是全新的,没有上面驴友说的什么设施很旧,很一般;送的水果也很精美;虽然上网是需要设定IP地址,但是网速还可以,并没有什么不方便;卫生间里也是有浴帘的,热水也不错,我不知道这是宾馆自己改进了,还是其他的驴友危言耸听;宾馆的车况的确很棒,都是进口车,我也包了宾馆的车二日游,是别克车,可是自己想一想,什么车什么档次,钱出的一点也不心疼,而且还很开心.这次到敦煌来玩,真的是不枉此行,很开心,很愉快,我建议其他来敦煌的朋友,不管是出差还是旅游,都可以选择这家宾馆,很不错,下次如果还来敦煌,还是会住这家宾馆.宾馆反馈2008年8月1日：非常感谢您对本宾馆的点评和肯定,对您的肯定本宾馆会更加努力,再您下次光临本宾馆时,还会有更多的变化!","I also read this hotel after watching the review on the Internet.

1,"总体不错。。。。。但是：骚扰电话不断！！！！全国住酒店那么多，第一次遇见警察查访，也许酒店还不够档次的缘故，希望在地震全国哀悼期间他们来不是为创收来的。。。否则。。。商务中心给的旅行价格高出外面20-30%，非常怄！！！补充点评2008年5月23日：您说的不是事实:警察直接进入我的房间查询的....还奇怪的问怎么我一个人住....呵呵，希望不是为了创收!不过总体对酒店服务还是比较满意的,虽然没有空调热了点,对抱歉送的2咖啡票太迟了，客人走你才送,呵呵，有点缺少诚意宾馆反馈2008年5月22日：敬的客人：非常感谢您入住我们酒店。接到您的投诉后，对“骚扰”电话进行彻查，找到源头，清除出酒店。温馨提示：遇到此情况您亦可及时致电前台投诉或设置免打扰（DND）。关于警察查访，经查证当值MOD、安全部、前厅部，因酒店突出的地理位置，为乌鲁木齐传递奥运圣火必经之地，为确保安全，警察对四星级以上酒店例行巡检（只在楼层未打扰客房）。关于旅行价格。是乌市四星级以上酒店联盟组织的高端团队，由于车辆、导游配置、路线选择、及服务项目的不同，本着为游客人身安全高度负责态度不同而产生的差异。对您的点评和建议表示由衷的感谢，对给您带来不便致以诚挚歉意，期待您的再次光临。","Overall.EssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceBut: Habits are constantly!IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionThere are so many hotels in the country.

1,刚去乌鲁木齐出差回来，通过携程预定的这里。第一次去乌鲁木齐市，全新的体验。个人认为这家酒店的确不错，给自己预定的是高级商务单人房，老板和老板的朋友的房间是豪华景观大床房。老板是个相当挑剔的人，但这次他居然对酒店相当满意，不容易啊。尤其值得提一下的是酒店的网络，速度不错，用起来还算是相当方便。第一次入住的时候酒店忘记赠送果盘了，后来也没有补，这点有点郁闷。第二次再入住的时候，酒店搞错了我的订单，少定了一间房。但酒店立刻就免费将我预定的所有房间升级了一个标准，同时赠送了果盘。对于房间本身，我一点意见都没有，干净，大气，整洁，漂亮。但是酒店晚上的按摩电话实在非常讨厌，多次和总台抗议之后都无效。而且电话时间分布极为散落，有早晨2点打进来的，也有5点多的。这样一间酒店总是有这样的电话实在很不合适。另外有点郁闷的是我的房间好冷啊，虽然因为降温后来中央空调有暖风了，但是房间里还是很冷，最后我居然盖了三床被子。不过一墙之隔的老板房间就全然没有类似问题，真的很奇怪。综合而言，下次再去乌鲁木齐的话，我还会选择这里，的确很不错。宾馆反馈2008年4月21日：尊敬的客人，非常感谢您入住我们酒店。在接到您的投诉后，酒店高度重视，并对此事进行了彻查，相信您下次入住不会再有此类事情发生。另外，关于您入住房间温度问题，由于乌鲁木齐天气突变，温度骤降，暖风因启动压力不够没有及时送达，您入住的房间是两面落地窗，光线视觉好，但保温效果会相对差些。现暖风已全面送达，酒店每间客房温度都在22度以上。由此给您带来的不便我们致以诚挚歉意，期待您的再次光临。,"I just went to Urumqi to come back and booked here through Ctrip.Go to Urumqi for the first time, a new experience.Personally, I think this hotel is really good. What I book for themselves is a high -end business single room. The room of the boss and the boss's friends is a luxury landscape bed room.The boss is a very picky person, but this time he was quite satisfied with the hotel and it was not easy.It is worth mentioning that the hotel's network is good, and it is quite convenient to use.The hotel forgot to give away the fruit plate when I stayed for the first time, and then did not make up for it. This was a bit depressed.When I stayed again for the second time, the hotel made a mistake in my order and set a room less.However, the hotel immediately upgraded all the rooms I booked for free and gave a fruit plate at the same time.For the room itself, I have no opinions at all, clean, atmospheric, tidy, and beautiful.However, the hotel's massage call at night is really annoying, and it is invalid after many protests with the main station.And the telephone time distribution is extremely scattered, and there are more than 5 o'clock in the morning, and there are more than 5 o'clock.Such a hotel always has such a call is really inappropriate.It is a bit depressed that my room is cold. Although the central air conditioner has a warm air after the cooling, the room is still very cold. In the end, I actually covered three beds.However, there are no similar problems in the boss room separated by a wall, which is really strange.In summary, if you go to Urumqi next time, I will choose here, it is really good.Hotel feedback on April 21, 2008: Dear guests, thank you very much for staying in our hotel.After receiving your complaint, the hotel attaches great importance to it and conducts a thorough investigation of the matter. I believe that you will not have such a thing again next time you stay in.In addition, about the temperature problem of your stay in the room, due to the sudden change in the weather in Urumqi, the temperature drops sharply, and the warm wind is not delivered in time due to insufficient pressure. The room you stay in is two -sided floor window, the light vision is good, but the thermal insulation effect will be relatively poor.The warm wind has been fully delivered, and the temperature of each room of the hotel is above 22 degrees.As a result of the inconvenience brought by you, we have a sincere apology and look forward to your visit again."
1,如注了套房，但没有想象中的宽敞，可能是老饭店的缘故吧。酒店地理位置得天独厚，来旅游的朋友建议入住此酒店，早餐迷你，但味道不错，该有的都有了。总体感觉尚可。,"If you have noticed the suite, but there is no spacious imagination, it may be because of the old restaurant.The hotel's geographical location is unique. Friends who come to travel are advised to stay in this hotel. Breakfast mini, but it tastes good and there should be.Overall feel."
1,酒店很干净，服务员态度可以。卫生间小了一点。酒店位置在闹市，比较方便。早餐也比较丰富，吃的满意。建议酒店增加一些宣传西塘的资料，并在酒店名片后面，简要指明到西塘的行车路线或公交路线/时刻表，以方便游客。,"The hotel is very clean, and the waiter's attitude is okay.The bathroom is a little smaller.The hotel is located in trouble, which is more convenient.Breakfast is also richer and satisfactory.It is recommended that the hotel add some information about Xitang and behind the hotel business card, briefly indicate the driving route or bus line/timetable to the Xitang to facilitate tourists."
1,"这次去香港,飞机晚点三小时,可到酒店,心情大好,房间升级,已为我们冰好香槟,水果,热情的服务,还有免费早餐,有两个餐厅选择,服务是最好,是我每次的首选,也会推荐给亲朋好友,很值得入住.","Go to Hong Kong this time, the plane is three hours late, you can go to the hotel.Every time I choose, I will recommend it to my friends and relatives, which is worth checking in."
1,非常值得住的酒店，房间卫生间的设计比较风格。购物非常方便，酒店对面的翠杏村酒家的广东点心非常好吃。离兰桂坊非常近。房间上网要收费显得有点小气。,"Very worthy hotels, the design of the bathroom in the room is more stylish.Shopping is very convenient, and the Guangdong snacks of Cuili Village Restaurant opposite the hotel are very delicious.Very close to Lan Kwai Fong.The charging of the room on the Internet is a bit stingy."
1,去了一看横幅和携程一个价！房间比较旧，不过总体来说感觉还可以！尤其值得一提的是餐厅的食物味道不错！周围酒吧比较密集！购物和交通也比较方便！,"Go to see the banner and Ctrip!The room is old, but it feels okay in general!It is particularly worth mentioning that the food of the restaurant tastes good!The bar is dense!Shopping and transportation are more convenient!"
1,当天晚上非常勤劳，把衣服全洗了，没想到房间空调在维修，整晚无法开启，正当着急之际，当晚值班的服务生及时赶到，将湿答答的衣服拿过去免费烘干，并在第二天早上5点送回我房间，真的非常感激！！！请酒店务必要奖励这样的服务人员啊宾馆反馈2008年4月15日：谢谢您对我们服务的肯定，我们会找到那位当班员工并给予奖励，期待您的再次光临！,"It was very hard to wash the clothes that night. I did not expect that the room air conditioner was repairing. It could not be turned on all night. On the occasion of the time, the waiter on duty arrived in time in time, took the wet clothes to dry it for free, and dried it for free.I was really grateful to my room at 5 o'clock the next morning!IntersectionIntersectionPlease be necessary to reward such a service staff.

1,"环境相当好,设施陈旧,服务不好不坏,热水不热.此行一共住了三家酒店,为什么就这里的蚊子特别多呢?如果再到鼓浪屿,从性价比考虑,也许还会住这里,只希望在价格不变的前提下,软硬件都再提高一些.","The environment is quite good, the facilities are old, the service is not good or bad, and the hot water is not hot. There are three hotels in this trip. Why is there a lot of mosquitoes here? If you go to Gulangyu, you may still live here.It is hoped that under the premise of unchanged prices, software and hardware will be improved."
1,位置极佳，在国贸附近，相对于其他4，5星级的宾馆，性价比还是可以的，还会去住,"The location is excellent. Near China Trade, compared to other 4,5 -star hotels, the price is still available, and you will still live."
1,位置好是没得说的，酒店比较老旧了，宽带有的还要收费。,It is not necessary to say that the location is old.
1,"个人觉得比旁边的建国饭店大大的物超所值.也不分什么内宾价格和外宾价格.房间新装修的,很现代,不象建国饭店给人感觉又老又阴森.","Personally, I think it ’s worth the great value than the Jianguo Hotel next to it. It is not distinguished from the price of the inner guests and the price of foreign guests. The new room is renovated. It is very modern."
1,"非常好的饭店,软件硬件都很过得去,值得一住的地方!","Very good restaurants, software and hardware are very good, where it is worth living!"
1,酒店位于大王峰下，环境很好，如果前台小姐的脸上能多几分笑意的话，那就更完美了。酒店内旅行社的服务素质有待提高。我们一行五人专请一位导游小姐，目的是为了走走停停，多几分宽松，不必象赶鸭子似地被赶来赶去。但导游小姐看起来似乎很不耐烦，一路自顾自的往前走，碰到景点，背课文似地草草点过，提点问题，更是敷衍了事。第二天，想和她沟通，才发现她的嗓门原来很大，对我们一开始就提出不购物的要求心存不满。需要提醒诸位的是，在酒店包车一天150元，但不是真正意义上的包车，而只是从酒店到景点，再从景点到酒店的两点一线的单纯距离而已。补充点评2008年7月28日：再补充一点，酒店内的水帘餐厅很不错，环境优雅，价格适中。如果你在武夷山不知去何处用餐的话，不妨到此一试。,"The hotel is located under the king's peak, and the environment is very good. If the front desk lady's face can smile more, it will be more perfect.The service quality of travel agencies in the hotel needs to be improved.We all invited a tour guide for five people, in order to stop and stop, a little more loose, and we didn't have to be rushed around like a duck.However, the tour guide seemed to be impatient. She walked forward all the way, encountered the attractions, and had a texture of the text.The next day, if she wanted to communicate with her, she found that her voice was very big, and she was dissatisfied with the demands of not shopping at the beginning.What needs to be reminded is that the hotel charter is 150 yuan a day, but it is not a real chartered car, but just from the hotel to the attractions, and then the simple distance from the attractions to the hotel's two -point line.Supplementary comment on July 28, 2008: To add, the water curtain restaurant in the hotel is very good, the environment is elegant, and the price is moderate.If you don't know where to dine in Wuyi Mountain, you may wish to try it here."
1,房间很干净，住的比较舒服，就是床有点硬。但是，号称在海河最美的一段纯粹是骗人，离海河至少要走十分钟，而且根本谈不上美。,"The room is very clean and the living is more comfortable, that is, the bed is a bit hard.However, the most beautiful section of the Haihe is purely deceiving, at least ten minutes away from Haihe, and it is not beautiful at all."
1,宾馆比较冷清，大概是五一假期变短的原故。酒店设施比较老旧，但据说在没有悦华前，这也是相当上档次的宾馆。我订的标间，卫生间比较小，房间内有专门供客人自已泡茶的茶桌及茶具，但有茶垢。环境很不错，空气很清新，住宿是在后楼，感觉很清静，只是飞机场距度假区很近，飞机来时噪音较大，总体说来还满意。武夷山的水不太容易洗东西，肥皂不易冲掉，很费劲。,"The hotel is relatively deserted, and it is about the reason for the shorter May holiday.The hotel facilities are relatively old, but it is said that before Yuehua, this is also a very high -level hotel.The standard room I booked is relatively small in the bathroom. There are tea tables and tea sets dedicated to brewing tea in the room, but there are tea dirt.The environment is very good. The air is very fresh. The accommodation is in the back floor. It feels very quiet, but the aircraft field is very close to the resort area. When the aircraft comes, the noise is relatively noise.Water in Wuyi Mountain is not easy to wash things, soap is not easy to get rid of it, it is very strenuous."
1,酒店环境不错，但是服务有不近人意之处，那次我订了一个标间，因当天有一个大团，他们给我升级，住母子房，谁知第二天却要我换房，让人郁闷。,"The hotel environment is good, but the service is not surprising. That time I booked a standard room. Because there was a large group that day, they upgraded me and lived in the mother and child's room.People are depressed."
1,服务态度很好不过似乎水平比不上态度，checkin&out永远是大家抱怨的焦点。据说总部规定要客人自己填写资料了，可以理解，不过厕所不放手纸不知是不是也是公司规定？很狼狈，赫赫。有点怀疑是不是每个角落都打扫了？不然怎么会忘了放厕纸？不过干净、卫生一如既往，真的不错，不过希望强化细节。,"The service attitude is very good, but it seems that the level is not as good as an attitude. Checkin & Out is always the focus of everyone's complaints.It is said that the headquarters requires the guests to fill in the information by themselves. It is understandable, but I do n’t know if the toilet does not put the paper paper?Very embarrassed, Hehe.Is it doubt whether it was cleaned in every corner?Otherwise, how can you forget to put the toilet paper?However, clean and hygiene is really good, but I hope to strengthen the details."
1,"酒店环境不错,很安全,房间也很干净.不过不够豪华,最多评三星,价格偏贵.早餐品种太少.","The hotel environment is good, very safe, and the room is very clean. However, it is not luxurious enough, and the most evaluates Samsung. The price is too expensive. There are too few breakfast varieties."
1,我是6月7日入住宾馆的，宾馆里的环境不错，餐厅做的菜挺好吃的。服务也不错，我要的东西很快就送到。晚上睡觉很安静。同等价位，我推荐这间宾馆。,"I stayed at the hotel on June 7th. The environment in the hotel was good, and the restaurant was delicious.The service is also good, what I want will be delivered soon.Sleeping at night is quiet.At the same price, I recommend this hotel."
1,如家的标准装潢，没的说，不过还和楼下的一样的老问题，水温是确实的忽冷忽热，隔音也是确实的惨了点。不过这个价位要求也不能太多了，但好歹下次搞定水温吧，这个应该不难....,"For example, the standard decoration of the home, not to mention, but the same old problem as downstairs, the water temperature is really cold and hot, and sound insulation is really miserable.However, this price requires too much, but anyway, it should be done next time, this should not be difficult ..."
1,如家的定位还是很不错的，我出差还是基本订如家。这次在十一经路店遇到了麻烦，在一楼餐厅吃饭时，钱夹被偷了！本来出门很小心的，看到餐厅里只有很少几位住店客人就餐，也就放松了警惕，把外套放在了椅子上，结果被贼盯上了，做到我后面掏了我的口袋（后悔呀，座到最后一排，恐怕贼就不好下手了！）。小服务员（估计不到20）觉出什么来了，好心提醒我要给我套衣服，我还觉得奇怪，平常没套过呀（活该破财，人家暗示我，我都没反应）。大家再来天津这个店，要小心了！,"The positioning of the family is still very good, and my business trip is basically a family.This time I met troubles in the Eleven Sutra shop. When I ate on the first floor restaurant, the money clip was stolen!I was very careful when I went out. I saw that there were only a few guests in the restaurant ate for meals. They also relaxed their vigilance and put the jacket on the chair. As a result, the thief was stared at.(Regret it, to the last row, I'm afraid the thief will not be able to start!).Small waiters (estimated less than 20) felt that it came, and I kindly reminded me to give me a suit. I still feel strange. I usually haven't set up (deserved money, people suggest me, I didn't respond).Come to Tianjin's shop again, be careful!"
1,知名度不错，机场打车一说十一经路，就问是如家吧。但是天津机场基本都是黑车。从酒店去机场不到30，机场来居然打表打出50多。,"The popularity is good. As soon as the airport taxi is said to be the eleven way, you can ask Rulai.But Tianjin Airport is basically a black car.Less than 30 from the hotel to the airport, the airport came to watch more than 50."
1,"我们是夜间1点多到的青岛，酒店安排了免费接机，酒店的服务从这时就开始了，上了接机车，司机就递上了消毒毛巾和矿泉水，给我们带来了一股清凉，车快到酒店时，司机通知酒店客人马上就到，车进入酒店直接停在了我们入住房间的楼门前，早已有服务员在此等候，为我们打开了车门，将我们送入了房间，紧接着送来了两杯果汁，并告知我们天色已晚，为不影响我们休息，明天再办理入住手续。我们住的贵宾楼新装修过了,我们订的是北房，安排在一楼，房间内的设施还是不错的，床和床上用品都够标准，这一夜睡得很舒服。第二天白天时，听到有不大的装修声音，LG提了点意见，酒店立即更换了房间，升级到了4楼的海景房，真是没得说。酒店的露天海水泳池正常是10点开始，LG有晨泳的习惯，游泳池的服务生说你什么时候来只要招呼一下就行，LG很高兴，我也破例没睡懒觉，去游了次晨泳。在酒店吃了一次晚餐，用餐间LG咳嗽了几声，餐厅服务生立即送来了一份银耳羹，一会又送来了止咳含片，像这么无微不至的关心，真是难得见到。走在酒店每一处，见到的每一位酒店员工都对你真诚地微笑，让人感到这里是一个大家庭，家里的每个人都很友好，我们的心也在微笑。从很多细微之处，体现了酒店的管理水平，从我们接触的酒店员工身上，我们看到了他们对酒店的热爱，以能在这个酒店工作为荣，这真是很难得的。在我们住过的酒店中，这家酒店以它一流的服务，一流的微笑，一流的管理给我们留下了深刻的印象，以后再到青岛，非它莫属了。","We were Qingdao, which arrived at 1 o'clock at night. The hotel arranged free pick -up. The hotel's service began at this time. When we got to pick up the locomotive, the driver passed the disinfection towels and mineral water, bringing us a one to us.When the stock is cool, when the car arrives at the hotel, the driver notified the hotel guests to arrive immediately. The car entered the hotel and stopped directly in front of the door of our stay in the room. A waiter has already waited here.The room, followed by two glasses of fruit juice, and told us that it was too late. In order not to affect our rest and check in tomorrow.The VIP building we lived in the newly renovated decoration. We ordered the North Room and arranged on the first floor. The facilities in the room were still good.On the next day, when I heard a small decoration sound, LG made some opinions. The hotel immediately changed the room and upgraded to the sea view room on the 4th floor.The hotel's open -air seawater swimming pool is normal at 10 o'clock. LG has the habit of morning swimming. The waiter of the swimming pool said that when you come to say hello, LG is very happy, I also do not sleep without sleep.After dinner at the hotel, LG cough a few times in the meal room, the waiter in the restaurant immediately sent a Tremella, and a cough -cough with a cough. It was rare to see such a meticulous concern.Everywhere in the hotel, every hotel employee I saw smiled sincerely at you, making people feel that this is a big family. Everyone at home is very friendly, and our hearts are smiling.From a lot of details, the management level of the hotel is reflected. From the hotel employees we are in contact with, we see their love for the hotel and be proud of work at this hotel. This is really rare.Among the hotels we have lived, this hotel has impressed us with its first -class service, first -class smile, and first -class management. After that, we will go to Qingdao. It is it."
1,"很不错的酒店,服务一流,员工都很敬业,无论是前台,服务台,行李生还是司机,都很热情而有礼貌.最后一天酒店了解到我是下午五点多的航班,主动将退房时间延迟到三点,而且安排巴士送到机场,住了这么多酒店,这是头一回.","Very good hotel, first -class service, employees are very dedicated. Whether it is the front desk, service desk, luggage, or driver, they are very enthusiastic and polite. On the last day, the hotel learned that I was a flight at more than 5 pm.The time was delayed to three points, and the buses were arranged to the airport, and there were so many hotels. This was the first time."
1,回来2天了，很忙，没来得及评价，今天周末得闲谈谈入住海景酒店的感触。我是7.25---7.30入住海景的，因为是家里人度假，加之孩子比较小（5岁），所以在决定去青岛度假时上网查了青岛酒店的情况，原来定的是栈桥王子酒店，后来又看到大家对海景的评价，感觉很惊讶，可以说是没有任何负面评价，大家一致说这个酒店极好，于是取消了栈桥王子改定海景，想看看到底海景靠什么取得大家的一致好评的！下面我就从海景的第一个电话谈起：我订的是7.25下午6点的飞机，到青岛大约7点左右，订酒店时在备注里写了需要酒店接机，在23日就接到酒店的电话，一个甜美的女孩和我联系了具体的接机时间还给我留了接机人员的联系电话，心里感到很舒服，25日下飞机后就看到有人举着写有我名字的牌子站在候机厅出口等着我们，一个帅气的小伙子非常礼貌的问好并极其自然的将我手中的行李接了过去，上了酒店的接送车后司机师傅马上递上了凉凉的毛巾和矿泉水，想的真是周到！一路欣赏青岛的夜景，大概行驶了40分钟左右抵达酒店，车还没停就看到大堂门口站着一位身穿西装的小伙子在等着，后来知道这个小伙子是专门接待我们的，下车后马上就有行李员把我们的行李装上推车，我按照惯例准备到大堂登记，结果小伙子直接把我们引导到房间了，所有的登记工作都由他帮我们完成，真的感到很舒服，第一印象非常好。房间很舒适，我订的是行政房2712，各项设施很齐全，房间里播放着舒缓的背景音乐，看得出酒店很用心，不一会就有服务员送来了橙汁和毛巾，还赠送了一对小玩偶，孩子很喜欢，后来发现原来每天都赠送玩偶和水果还有小点心，结果把宝宝高兴的不得了，回家时光是玩偶就装了一口袋。服务方面更是没得说，房间服务非常及时和细心，在餐厅吃饭时服务员特地给宝宝拿来儿童专用的可爱的卡通餐具，有一天宝宝有点发烧，酒店很快就派了医生上来，给开了药，晚饭考虑到怕宝宝受不了空调，就叫了送餐服务，结果晚饭送来后发现酒店给加了一大碗银耳粥、一大盘薯条还有一碗姜汤，宝宝吃得兴高采烈，病马上好了一半，第二天服务员看到我们还问候宝宝的病情呢，让人感觉很温暖。有一天晚饭时我因为吸烟过多有轻微咳嗽，不一会服务员就端上一碗银耳粥给我，告诉我可以减轻咳嗽，还有，最后一天吃早饭时，宝宝因为头天傍晚和妈妈去海边找小螃蟹时腿上被蚊子咬了一个小包包，我们自己都没在意，可是服务员看到宝宝抓痒后主动送来了消毒的碘敷和风油精还帮宝宝擦药，令我们做父母的汗颜。5天的假期很快就要结束了，我问宝宝，回家好不好？宝宝说：不想回家，还想在酒店住下去。童言无忌、童言无欺！在海景的五天我很感动，海景的员工真正的体现出海景的企业文化，如果说海景的硬件是5星级，那么海景的服务绝对是7星级。海景是青岛的骄傲，也是我们中国的骄傲！,"I have been back for 2 days, I am very busy, I have not had time to evaluate. I have to talk about the feeling of staying at the Sea View Hotel this weekend.I stayed at 7.25 --- 7.30 to stay in the sea view. Because I was on vacation at home, and my child was young (5 years old), I decided to check the situation of Qingdao Hotel on the Internet when I decided to go to Qingdao.I also saw everyone's evaluation of the sea view, and I felt surprised. It can be said that there was no negative evaluation. Everyone said that the hotel was excellent, so I canceled the Lord Prince to change the sea view. I wantedIntersectionBelow I start with the first phone number of the sea view: I booked a plane at 7.25 pm at about 7 pm, about 7 o'clock in Qingdao. When I booked a hotel, I wrote a hotel to pick up the hotel.The hotel's phone number, a sweet girl contacted me with the specific pick -up time and left the contact number of the pick -up staff. I felt very comfortable. After getting off the plane on the 25th, I saw someone holding a name with my name.The brand stood in the waiting hall and waited for us. A handsome guy asked politely and naturally picked up the luggage in my hand. After getting on the hotel's pick -up car, the driver master immediately handed on a cool towel and a cool towel and a cool towel and a cool towel.Mineral water, what you think is really thoughtful!Enjoying the night view of Qingdao along the way, driving about 40 minutes to arrive at the hotel. Before the car stopped, he saw a young man standing in the lobby.Immediately, there will be a luggage officer to put our luggage on the cart. I prepared to register in the lobby according to the practice. As a result, the young man directly guided us to the room. All the registration work was done by him.One impression is very good.The room is very comfortable. I booked 2712 administrative houses. Various facilities are very complete. The room is played with soothing background music. It can be seen that the hotel is very careful. After a while, the waiter sent orange juice and towels.A pair of dolls, the child liked it very much. Later, I found that the dolls, fruits, and snacks were given every day. As a result, the baby was so happy.In terms of service, it is not necessary to say that the room service is very timely and careful. When eating in the restaurant, the waiter specially brought the baby for children for children with a cute cartoon tableware. One day the baby has a fever, and the hotel will send a doctor soon to open it.After dinner, considering that I was afraid that the baby could not stand the air conditioner, I called the meal delivery service. As a result, I found that the hotel added a large bowl of Tremella porridge, a large plate of fries, and a bowl of ginger soup.The sickness was half better. The next day the waiter saw that we still grew the baby's condition, making people feel very warm.One day I had a slight cough due to too much smoking. After a while, the waiter brought me a bowl of silver -ear porridge and told me that I could reduce the cough. And on the last day, the baby went to the sea because of the evening on the night.When I was looking for a small crab, I was bitten by a mosquito on my legs. We didn't care, but the waiter took the initiative to send the disinfected iodine compress and wind oil after seeing the baby's itching.Family.The 5 -day holiday is about to end. I ask my baby, okay?The baby said: I don't want to go home, I want to live in the hotel.Tongyan is not bad, childhood words are not bullying!I was very moved in the five days of sea view. The employees of the sea view truly reflected the corporate culture of the sea view. If the hardware of the sea view is a 5 -star, then the service of the sea view is definitely a 7 -star.Sea view is the pride of Qingdao and the pride of our China!"
1,从携程网上看到大家对海景花园的服务评价很高.我们于7月下旬到青岛避暑，特意入住该店。入住5天感同身受，果然名不虚传。可以说在我们住过的宾馆里服务是一流的。有几处尤其让我很感动。比如，西餐厅主管王杰和服务员金玉盛听说我有胃病，除了在进餐时照顾我，还给我拿来一些生花生米，说每天吃几个可以保护胃黏膜。我爱吃青菜，每次都单独给我炒一小盘。我们到青岛的那天下着雨，客户关系主任直接送我们进房间，在房间里办了入住手续。他在登记时看到我脚面上贴着膏药，很快让楼层服务员给我送来几张云南白药膏。后来蓝吧服务员也注意到我走路一瘸一拐，又给了一盒膏药。我贴后基本痊愈。我有慢性咽炎，进了空调房就咳嗽。大堂服务员马上给我取来金嗓子喉宝，蓝吧服务员又拿来咳嗽糖浆。我服用后很快见效。楼层服务员总是在我们外出后收拾房间，每次回来房间总是整整齐齐的，晚上还送来牛奶。这可是我们在外旅行从没有接受过的待遇。我们走进酒店，见到的员工都微笑打招呼，让人感到很亲切。我还注意到，酒店提供的早餐食品，给房间送的水果和小礼品，质量都比较好。所有这一切都说明酒店总经理管理有方，把这么多的员工培养得如此之好，让他们树立顾客至上理念，提供人性化服务，殷勤，热情，细致，周到，这是很不容易的。其实，作为五星级酒店，该店硬件并不很理想。但是。他们超一流的服务的确吸引了顾客。我们明年避暑还是首选青岛，到青岛住店当然还是首选海景花园.,"From Ctrip.com, everyone's service evaluation of the sea view garden is very high. We went to Qingdao to avoid the summer in late July and stayed in the store.5 days of staying in the same body, it really is worthy of the name.It can be said that the service in the hotel we have lived is first -class.Several moves were particularly moved.For example, Wang Jie, director of the western restaurant, and the waiter Jin Yusheng heard that I had stomach problems. In addition to taking care of me during the meal, I also brought me some raw peanuts, saying that eating a few every day can protect the gastric mucosa.I love to eat vegetables, and I will fry me a small plate alone every time.On the day we went to Qingdao, we were raining. The client relationship director directly sent us into the room and completed the procedures in the room.When he registered, he saw the plaster on my feet, and quickly asked the floor waiter to send me a few Yunnan white ointment.Later, the waiter of Lan Bar also noticed that I was limped and gave a box of plaster.I basically healed after post.I have chronic pharyngitis, and I cough after entering the air -conditioned room.The lobby waiter immediately took me a golden throat, and the Lan Bar waiter brought a cough syrup again.After taking it, I will work quickly after taking it.The waiter of the floor is always cleaned up after we go out. Every time I return to the room, it is always neatly neatly, and milk is also sent at night.This is the treatment we have never been accepted abroad.When we walked into the hotel, the employees we saw and greeted them with a smile, making people feel very kind.I also noticed that the breakfast food provided by the hotel, the fruit and small gifts given to the room, the quality is better.All of this indicates that the general manager of the hotel is managed, and so many employees have been cultivated so well, so that they can establish customer first concepts, provide humanized services, diligence, enthusiasm, meticulous, and thoughtful. This is not easy.In fact, as a five -star hotel, the store's hardware is not ideal.but.Their super -class service has indeed attracted customers.We will still choose Qingdao for the summer of the summer next year. Of course, the preferred sea garden in Qingdao is still the first choice."
1,还不错，可以住一下，并且建议你住高一点层次的房间,"Not bad, you can live, and I suggest you live a higher level of rooms"
1,酒店很好可以免费打长途，随便打都不要钱，这点比较吸引人,"The hotel is very good, you can play for free long distances, do not money if you just hit it. This is more attractive"
1,总体感觉不错，就是房间的窗户感觉不是很好使用，早餐一般，但是还是值得一住！,"Overall feels good, that is, the window of the room feels not easy to use, breakfast is average, but it is worth living!"
1,航空酒店还是不错的，房间也干净整洁，地理位置也好，价位也适中。,"Aviation hotels are still good, the rooms are clean and tidy, the geographical location is good, and the price is moderate."
1,家具太陈旧，早餐也很简单。这些都不说了，让我气愤的是我裤兜里的300块通知洗衣前忘了拿出来，等到4小时后想起来再打电话询问的时候已经没有了。房务中心的服务员很甜美地告诉我：“确实没有看到，我们在洗衣前有三道检查的，麻烦您再找找。”我不想冤枉她们，找遍了所有的地方可就是没有。无话可说....下次不会再住那里了。,"The furniture is too old, and the breakfast is very simple.I do n’t say anymore. What makes me angry is that the 300 yuan in my pants pocket forgot to take it out before laundry. After 4 hours, I thought of calling and asking.The waiter at the Housing Center told me sweetly: ""I didn't see it. We had three inspections before laundry. Please look for it again."" I don't want to wrong them.There is nothing to say .... I won't live there again next time."
1,就是网络速度超慢，而且经常掉线，前台服务不太专业。,"That is, the network speed is super slow, and it is often dropped. The front desk service is not very professional."
1,"酒店的环境非常好,但是房间装修一般,比较旧.服务也不错,有24小时送餐服务.虽然设施陈旧,下次还会选择这里,因为酒店的环境吸引我碰巧是桃花开花季节,非常大的桃园,开得很灿烂的桃花!值得!","The hotel's environment is very good, but the room decoration is average, and the old. The service is also good. There are 24 hours of food delivery services. Although the facilities are old, I will choose here because the environment of the hotel attracts me.Taoyuan, the peach blossoms that are very bright! It is worth it!"
1,酒店环境一流，房间也很令人满意，舒适、干净、卫生，只是楼下的中餐厅收费比较高，在房间打电话去旁边的夜总会还要收电话费，有点那个...不过总体感觉还是对得上五星标准。,"The hotel environment is first -rate, and the room is also very satisfactory. It is comfortable, clean, and hygienic. It is just that the Chinese restaurants downstairs are relatively high. The nightclub in the room will collect the phone fee.Follow the five -star standard."
1,总体来说还可过得去。我们入住时，房间还未打扫，和酒店人员反应，马上处理了。房内设施应该只够三星！宾馆反馈2007年7月27日：现在正值旺季，酒店的入住率较高，所以出现了上述情况，我们对此表示歉意。目前酒店已制订了一系列的相关措施，以保证旺季能及时安排清晨到店客人的入住。我们十分感谢您提出的宝贵意见，希望您下次有机会能再次入住我们酒店。,"Overall, it can be passed.When we stayed, the room had not been cleaned, and responded to the hotel staff and dealt with it immediately.The facilities in the room should only be enough for Samsung!Hotel feedback on July 27, 2007: Now it is the peak season, the hotel's occupancy rate is high, so the above situation has occurred, and we apologize for this.At present, the hotel has formulated a series of relevant measures to ensure that the early morning guests can be arranged in the peak season.We are very grateful to your precious opinions. I hope you will have the opportunity to stay in our hotel again next time."
1,"对一个三星级酒店来说,他们做的已经很不错.酒店环境不错,很方便.服务人员很努力.特别很感动的是,在餐厅是,我要冰水.每次服务员总是不厌其烦的去做(他们没有冰水而是用开水加冰做).前台服务生也是一样。帮助叫出租车很耐心。房间也是不错。尽管没有无烟房间，房间里没有烟味（5楼）。不足的是浴缸墙上有发霉。而我自己不巧，健身房之类在装修，没机会利用。","For a three -star hotel, they have done a good job. The hotel environment is good and convenient. The service staff is very hard. It is very moved. In the restaurant, I want ice water.Do it (they do not have ice water, but use boiling water to add ice). The same is true of the front desk waiters.Helping taxis is patient.The room is also good.Although there is no smoke -free room, there is no smoke in the room (5th floor).The disadvantage is that there is mold on the bathtub wall.And I do n’t happen to be decorating the gym and the like, and I have no chance to use it."
1,酒店位置不错，交通方便。硬件环境虽然显得比较旧了，但依旧不失档次。服务态度基本令人满意。宽带网络速度不错，就是还需要单独联系前台开通帐号且没有什么提示说明，不大方便。房间里准备了灭蚊器，但是没有药片，需要自己联系服务员索取。离店那天的早餐不大理想，还没到结束时间（差一小时），我们一边吃，服务员一边在旁边就把各种餐具、菜品收走了，令人感觉比较尴尬。另外，在卫生间看到,"The hotel location is good and the traffic is convenient.Although the hardware environment looks older, it still does not lose.The service attitude is basically satisfactory.The broadband network is good, that is, it is not convenient to contact the front desk to open an account and there is no prompt.The mosquito -extinguishing device is prepared in the room, but there is no pill, and you need to contact the waiter to ask for it yourself.The breakfast on the day of the store is not ideal. Before the end of the end (one hour), we ate, the waiter took away various tableware and dishes while the waiter was beside him. It felt embarrassing.In addition, see in the bathroom"
1,"酒店的地理位置不错,出门就是公园,就是房间偏小,早餐还可以.","The hotel's geographical location is good. When you go out, you are the park, that is, the room is small, and breakfast is okay."
1,作为一家两星级酒店已经不错了，我订的是套房，房间很干净也很宽敞，卫生间很大，还带淋浴房，服务也很到位，毛病就是服务员的普通话需要加强,"As a two -star hotel, it's good. I booked a suite. The room is very clean and spacious. The bathroom is very large. It also has a shower room. The service is also in place."
1,从总体来说，酒店的服务设施及服务人员的态度都是比较不错的，但是预定酒店时所说的提供免费宽带却是没有的，所以，专门带的笔记本也没有用上。结帐时想使用信用卡支付，却被告知当天不能刷卡。建议在这方面的信息需要再准确些。,"In general, the attitude of the hotel's service facilities and service personnel is relatively good, but there is no free broadband when booking the hotel when booking the hotel. Therefore, the special laptop is not useful.I wanted to pay with a credit card at checkout, but I was told that I could not swipe the card that day.It is recommended that the information in this area needs to be more accurate."
1,房间的隔音设计实在是不行，墙壁与玻璃外墙之间明显是没堵好，其他还好。,The sound insulation design of the room is really not enough. The wall and the glass exterior wall are obviously not blocked. Others are okay.
1,不错，外边看比较旧，但是里面很干净，交通也很方便，退房很快。在房间就可以看音乐喷泉，不错。,"Yes, it is older outside, but the inside is very clean, the transportation is also very convenient, and the check -ups are fast.You can watch the music fountain in the room, yes."
1,"2007年9月份曾住二晚,总体评价:1、服务还可以，入住的客人特别多，尤其是旅行团的，可能是肇庆市区较价廉物美的一间酒店。2、房间设施旧些，但干净。3、住观景房比较值得。","I lived in two nights in September 2007. The overall evaluation: 1. The service is okay. There are many guests who stay in, especially the tour groups. It may be a cheaper hotel in Zhaoqing City.2. The room facilities are old, but clean.3. It is more worth living in the viewing room."
1,4月份回青岛顺便带朋友去玩的，为他们选择的就是该酒店，房间干净整洁，但是卫生间的设施太简陋，房间内有小冰箱，考虑的比较周到，如果卫生间设备好一点就更好了！服务人员的态度非常好，没有给我们青岛人丢脸，电话随叫随到。,"In April, I returned to Qingdao to play with friends by the way. The hotel was selected for them. The room was clean and tidy, but the facilities in the bathroom were too simple. There were small refrigerators in the room.IntersectionThe attitude of the service staff is very good. It was not embarrassed to get our Qingdao people, and the call was called."
1,"周围环境很好.购物吃饭也很便利。(但是无一线大品牌专卖店)酒店服务不错,但是在入住时发生一个小插曲：说我没有预先付款,还好最终顺利解决了！此外,前台对我是通过携程预定,表现出“不知道如何形容”的表情,嘴里小声说到：啊,携程来的啊&*@#@*....(我略听得懂一些粤语)不知其他携程会员入住该酒店时,是否发生类似情况?","The surrounding environment is very good. Shopping and eating are also convenient.(But there is no first -line big brand store) The hotel service is good, but a small episode occurs during check -in: I said that I did not pay in advance, but fortunately, I finally solved it smoothly!In addition, the front desk was reserved by Ctrip to me, showing the expression of ""I don't know how to describe it"", and whispered in my mouth: Ah, Ctrip &*@#@*.... (I can understand some someCantonese) I wonder if other Ctrip members are in the hotel, do they have a similar situation?"
1,走廊的地毯非常软，很舒服。服务员的服务也很周到，态度很好。感觉酒店的管理比较到位。一层的自助早餐品种有些少、单调。不过晚上露天的啤酒节感觉很好，凉爽的风吹着，喝点酒，特别舒服，主要是比较卫生。,"The carpet of the corridor is very soft and comfortable.The waiter's service is also very thoughtful and has a good attitude.I feel that the management of the hotel is relatively in place.The first layer of buffet breakfast variety is a little and monotonous.However, the open -air beer festival feels very good at night. The cool wind blows, drinking wine is particularly comfortable, mainly hygienic."
1,"我喜家酒店,很多年前住,後又住其他的酒店,感是家好.得它性比都不.尤其在周境上,景美,外出用餐也步行分.有小的商,有百佳,吉之等,很方便的.然大的物比如海港城,有十元的程,但如果你愿意等,有酒店提供的免巴士,30分一班到尖沙嘴,也是很方便的.有,入住那天恰逢我生日,到大堂登服生就我了生日快,晚上又送了美味的蛋糕,一支很漂亮的玫瑰,有洋酒.很心.有,那天因我去得早,11就我入住了,之,次入住,有什麽不意的地方.","I like the hotel, I lived many years ago, and then I lived in other hotels. I feel good at home. It is comparable to it. Especially in the weekly situation, Jingmei, I also walk on dining.Baijia, Ji Zhi, etc., very convenient. Ran big things such as Harbor City, there are ten yuan, but if you want to wait, there are free buses provided by the hotel, 30 minutes to Tsim Sha Tsui, it is also very convenient.Yes, the day of staying coincided with my birthday, I went to the lobby to give birth to my birthday quickly, and I gave a delicious cake at night. A very beautiful rose, there was a foreign wine. I was very hearty. Yes, I went early because I went early, I went early because I went early, I went early because I went early.11 I stayed in, this time, there is any unexpected place."
1,"很好,风景美极了,窗户下面就是海,在边上的酒吧喝着啤酒,看着海景,简直太享受了,下次去还会去住这家酒店","Very good, the scenery is so beautiful, there is the sea under the window. Drinking beer on the bar on the side, watching the sea view, it is so enjoyable, I will stay in this hotel next time"
1,我是1月20日入住的。。订的大床房。位于西环的中远，很明显有内地装修的风格。。哈哈。比如电视能收到中央一台而没有cnn之类的。。400一晚。。后来两天380一晚。我觉得很抵！lg跟我觉得最赞的是那个大大的浴池。。每天从街上很累的回来。。可以很爽的泡个澡。。实在是。。。goooooooood。其他的设备比较简单。。但是这个价位。。这么大的面积（少说也有25平米）在hk是很难找到了。。对于我酷爱地铁的人来说。。唯一的缺陷就在于他的位置离地铁比较远。。以前住的港岛皇悦就方便多了。。。。,"I stayed on January 20.EssenceBooking a large bed.Located in the West Ring, it is obvious that there is a style of mainland decoration.EssenceHa ha.For example, TV can receive a central government without CNN.Essence400 one night.EssenceLater two days 380 a night.I think it's very good!LG is the best thing I think is the big bath.EssenceI am tired from the street every day.EssenceYou can take a bath very well.EssenceIt is really.EssenceEssenceGOOOOOOOOOD.Other devices are relatively simple.EssenceBut this price.EssenceIt is difficult to find such a large area (less than 25 square meters) in HK.EssenceFor those who love the subway.EssenceThe only defect is that he is far away from the subway.EssenceEmperor Yue, Hong Kong Island, who lived before, was much more convenient.EssenceEssenceEssence"
1,位于西环，地处香港老城区，门口有巴士及电车站，交通比较便利，酒店环境一般，但相对于390元的价位来说，还是比较划算的。,"Located in the West Ring, it is located in the old city of Hong Kong. There are buses and trains at the door. The transportation is more convenient and the hotel environment is average, but it is still more cost -effective compared to the price of 390 yuan."
1,酒店位于较偏的西环，不过交通还方便，门口不远就是有轨电车站，2元可以坐全程，不过速度稍慢，站也很多。不过因为地段偏，附近吃饭相对便宜，茶餐厅15-30块就够了。房间设施一般，不过在HK面积算大了，毕竟才390港币，折算成人民币才350多。休闲游的可以考虑住这里。,"The hotel is located in a more partial West Ring, but the traffic is convenient. The door is not far from the tram station. It can be taken through the whole process of 2 yuan, but the speed is slightly slower and there are many stations.However, because of the location, eating nearby is relatively cheap, and 15-30 yuan for tea restaurants is enough.The room facilities are average, but the area of HK is large. After all, it is only 390 Hong Kong dollars, which is converted into more than 350 yuan.Those who are leisure can consider living here."
1,坐落在香港的老城区，可以体验香港居民生活，门口交通很方便，如果时间不紧，坐叮当车很好呀！周围有很多小餐馆，早餐就在中远后面的南北嚼吃的，东西很不错。我们定的大床房，挺安静的，总体来说不错。前台结账没有银联！,"Located in the old town in Hong Kong, you can experience the lives of Hong Kong residents. The traffic at the door is very convenient.There are many small restaurants around, and the breakfast is chewing north -south behind COSCO. The things are very good.Our large bed room is quiet and generally good.There is no UnionPay at the front desk!"
1,前几年住过一次，这次去感觉它的变化太大了，服务很好，好像全面装修过了，房间很温馨，床上用品很舒服，还配送了果篮、晚安点心，还可以免费烫衣服，性价比高，有点遗憾的是卫生间有点小，过几天同事出差，建议还住这里！补充点评2008年2月25日：酒店的餐饮很不错，没有提前预订，所以只能做大厅，菜式、味道都称一绝！,"I have lived once a few years ago. This time I feel that its changes have changed too much, the service is very good, it seems that it has been fully renovated, the room is very warm, the bedding is very comfortable, and the fruit baskets, good night snacks, and free hotness can be hot for free.The clothes are cost -effective. It is a bit regrettable that the bathroom is a bit small. In a few days, colleagues are traveling on a business trip. It is recommended to live here!Supplementary comment on February 25, 2008: The restaurant in the hotel is very good. It is not reservations in advance, so you can only make a hall."
1,同意前面的弟兄们，周围都在拆迁，环境交通很差，地铁很方便，但是房间很好。不知道酒店会不会也被拆迁？有点好奇补充点评2008年6月26日：checkout的时候很郁闷，我都等半天了，总台小姐竟然先办人家插队的人，鄙视，懒得去争了,"Agree with the brothers in front of them, the surroundings are demolished, environmental transportation is poor, and the subway is very convenient, but the room is good.I wonder if the hotel will be demolished?A bit curious to add comments June 26, 2008: I was very depressed when checkout. I have waited for a long time."
1,1、位置：交通便利，距机场快线九龙站40港币车程，据铜锣湾时代广场80港币车程，海港城起步费车程；弥敦道步行即可，购物非常方便；2、环境：较为安静，适于居住；3、设施：维护较好，但设施已较旧，传统电视机；4、饮食：酒店早餐品种较多，令人惊喜；附近餐厅亦提供其他选择；5、服务：员工热情，主动；,"1. Position: Convenient transportation, 40 Hong Kong dollars from the Kowloon Station of the Airport Express Line, according to the 80 Hong Kong dollar drive of the Causeway Bay Times Plaza, the start fee of the Harbor City; the Machiedao walks, the shopping is very convenient; 2. The environment: more quiet, suitable for suitable, suitableLiving; 3. Facilities: Good maintenance, but the facilities are older, traditional TVs; 4. Diet: There are many varieties of hotel breakfast, which is surprising; nearby restaurants also provide other options;Items"
1,"这次住尖东,其实也不是很不方便.走路到弥墩道或者去海港城都不远.离星光大道很近.房间是边套的海景房,还不错,很干净,面积也大.每天有两小块巧克力送。有迎宾的水果。海景嘉逸的大堂比较小，让人感受不到五星级，服务和早餐都还不错的，周围环境也好。除了海景，离公园也很近。比住在海港城附近更舒适。","This time I lived in Jiaodong, but it was not very inconvenient. It was not far from walking to Midun Road or going to Harbor City. It was very close to Starlight Avenue. The room was a sea -view room with a sideline. It was not bad, very clean, and the area was large.Two small chocolates are sent every day.There are welcome fruits.The lobby of the sea view Jiayi is relatively small, so that people can not feel five -star, the service and breakfast are not bad, and the surrounding environment is good.In addition to the sea view, it is very close to the park.It is more comfortable than living near Harbor City."
1,房间虽小五脏具全，我们住的是海景房，需要另加400块，不住海景房在那儿住就没意义了。早上在中餐厅的早茶比较惬意可口。周边逛街比较方便。,"Although the room is full of organs, we live in the sea view room, and we need to add 400 pieces. It is meaningless to stay there.The morning tea in Chinese restaurants is more comfortable.Shopping around is more convenient."
1,"是绝佳的购物首选酒店,楼下就是连卡佛和海港城，但乘搭地铁就需步行10分钟。房间设施和装潢都显陈旧，入住的是吸烟楼层，异味很重，如果没有烟瘾的话，务必交代预定非吸烟楼层。自助餐的水准的确挺差，和200元的收费不符。","It is the first choice of hotels for shopping. The downstairs are Lian Carver and Harbor City, but take a subway for 10 minutes.The room facilities and decoration are old, and the smoking floors are staying in. The odor is very heavy. If there is no smoking addiction, be sure to explain the scheduled non -smoking floor.The level of buffets is indeed poor, and it does not match the charges of 200 yuan."
1,原先看了别人的评价，做好了不怎么样的准备，到了之后真的有惊喜的感觉，在富豪酒店住了3天，（我们也是住在三楼，）房间虽然不是很大，但也够住了，房间是新装修的，很不错，也蛮有情调的，四面都是镜子，感觉不错，服务人员的态度也还是不错的，第一天到酒店时，忘了行李，酒店还专门打电话询问呢，一个老先生还帮我们收好了行李，CHECK-IN的速度也很快的，也没有什么说普通话被歧视的感觉，交通离地铁远了些，但周围公交和小巴很方便，我们一共去了五个人，所以打车去地铁站比做小巴和公交合算，周围的又一城和新城都是购物的好去处，附近的小吃，茶餐厅，甜品店很多的，一家叫口香舌滑的甜品店里的榴莲飘飘很不错的，总的来说，这家酒店的性价比还是很不错的，以后还会去的，另外在酒店还可以定去迪士尼的直达车，也很方便的。周围环境不是很现代，但也没什么影响。,"I originally watched the evaluation of others, and I was so ready. After that, I really felt a surprise. I lived in a rich hotel for 3 days. (We also live on the third floor,) Although the room is not very large, but it is also very large, but alsoEnough to live, the room is newly renovated. It is very good and quite emotional. It is a mirror on all sides. It feels good. The attitude of the service staff is still good. When I arrived at the hotel on the first day, I forgot my luggage. The hotel also dedicated to the hotel.Calling and asking, an old gentleman also helped us collect his luggage. The speed of check-in is also very fast. There is no feeling of saying that Mandarin is discriminated against.Convenient, we went to five people in total, so taxiing to the subway station is more cost -effective than making small bus and bus. Another city and new city are all good shopping places. Nearby snacks, tea restaurants, and dessert shops.The durian in the dessert shop with a slim -lip tongue is very good. Generally speaking, the cost -effectiveness of this hotel is still very good, and it will go in the future.Very convenient.The surrounding environment is not very modern, but it has no effect."
1,酒店房间很大，这是最大的优点。设施不是很新，楼道的空调太冷了，只能把房间的空调关掉。总体还是不错的,"The hotel room is large, which is the biggest advantage.The facility is not very new, the air conditioner of the corridor is too cold, and the air conditioner in the room can only be turned off.Overall is good"
1,"在沙田,地理位置也不算坏,只是离地铁站略微远了些,环境也还好,服务不错,前台的checkin/checkout都很快.房间嘛,不象传说中香港酒店房间那么小,感觉足够大了.哈.很舒服的.","In Shatian, the geographical location is not bad, but it is slightly farther away from the subway station, the environment is also good, the service is good, the checkin/checkout at the front desk is very fast.It's big enough. Ha. It's very comfortable."
1,非常好的宾馆，我住的是19楼290元的房间。可以鸟瞰整个西宁市和远处的群山，美丽极了。酒店很干净，服务也很好，设施齐备，餐厅营业时间很长，取款机就有两台，可以代买火车票机票，商务中心也态度很友好，酒店很大，地理位置很好，处于西宁的中心，步行到中心广场很近（相当于上海的人民广场），酒店边上就有拼车到塔尔寺的集散点(夏利车8元／人)，很方便。酒店与国家领导人下榻的国宾馆相邻，闹中取静，很安静，很安全（经常看到警察在把守）。总的来说比较符合我的要求，性价比很高的酒店。下次来西宁还住这里，呵呵。,"Very good hotel, I live in a room of 290 yuan in the 19th floor.You can take a bird's eye view of the mountains and the mountains in the distance.The hotel is very clean, the service is also very good, the facilities are all available, the restaurant is open for a long time, and there are two cash machines. You can buy a train ticket ticket on your behalf. The business center is also very friendly. The hotel is very large, the geographical location is very good.In the center, walking to the central square is very close (equivalent to the People's Square in Shanghai). There is a distribution point (Charlie 8 yuan / person) from the carpool to Tal Temple by the hotel. It is very convenient.The hotel is adjacent to the national hotel where the national leaders stayed.In general, it is more in line with my requirements, a very cost -effective hotel.Next time I come here to live here, haha."
1,住的IIA的标准间298的，总的来说还是有4星的样子的，房间够大，卫生间热水什么的还不错，各种设施都是标准配置。就是房子比较老了，这个价位如果在旺季还可以其他时间就不值了。早餐没说的那么差，但是宾馆会议很多，赶上团队你就得早去不然全是菜汤了。服务各方面也还比较标准流畅，如果你不很熟悉西宁住那里倒是很安全，警察和交警总在门口执勤，现在去正修路有点不方便,"The standard room of the IIA IIA is 298. In general, there are 4 stars. The room is large enough, the bathroom hot water is not bad, and various facilities are standard configuration.That is, the house is relatively old. If this price can still be worth it at other times in the peak season.It's not as bad as breakfast, but there are a lot of hotel meetings. If you catch up with the team, you have to go early or it's all vegetable soup.All aspects of the service are also relatively smooth. If you are not familiar with Xining's living there, it is safe. Police and traffic police always duty at the door. Now it ’s inconvenient to go to the road"
1,青海宾馆在西宁还算不错，大床房床离门非常近，隔音不算太好，电视小且旧，不过酒店环境还可以，早餐也不错。,"Qinghai Hotel is pretty good in Xining. The big bed bed is very close to the door. The sound insulation is not very good. The TV is small and old, but the hotel environment is okay and breakfast is good."
1,"还行,房间小是不可以抱怨的，因为这是在香港,如果是来购物的话是个不错的选择!","Okay, the room is small, because it is in Hong Kong. If it is coming to shop, it is a good choice!"
1,套房很不错。风景也很好。唯一美中不足的是酒店的位置比较难找，交通也不大方便。,"The suite is very good.The scenery is also very good.The only disadvantage is that the location of the hotel is difficult to find, and the transportation is not convenient."
1,这家酒店基本上是我的常住酒店，干净离我要办事（中环）的地方很近，如果是早上我通常走半山自动扶梯下去，大概20分钟。如果不想走路，他们也有专车接送，不过时间不一定能match自己的schedule。打车从中环上来，也就是20~25港币。省点钱的话，到怡和大厦坐12路车也可以到门口。服务员很sweet，特别是一个叫Angel的女孩，很耐心。只有一次我要求的是双标房，实在震撼，放下行李，基本上我一家三口就不能走动了。比我小时候的房间还小，于是我马上要求换房，当然upgrade是要加钱的。海景套房是不错的，位于半山，夜景一流。他们还有专车接送去赤柱，海洋公园和山顶缆车站。我们省了一笔路费和时间。他们还有自己的小餐厅，东西还挺好吃分量也足，午饭有任食的soup和甜品。下午茶就更便宜了。在中环的地头，这个价钱也只有这家了。我们从山顶下来后是走回家的，也就是半小时左右，经过兰桂芳。沿着自动扶梯，有很多小食店，吃东西还行，有几家开得很晚，半夜了有很多客人。还有一家叫莲香楼的很老很老字号。,"This hotel is basically my permanent hotel. It is very close to the place where I want to do (Central). If I usually go to the half -mountain escalator in the morning, about 20 minutes.If you don't want to walk, they also have special car pickups, but time may not be able to match their own schedule.Taxi comes from the middle, which is HK $ 20 to 25.If you save money, you can also reach the door by taking a 12 -way car in Jihe Building.The waiter is very Sweet, especially a girl named Angel, which is very patient.Only one time I asked for a double -standard room, it was really shocking. Putting down my luggage, basically my family of three couldn't walk.I was smaller than my childhood room, so I immediately asked to change the house. Of course, UPGrade had to add money.Sea -view suite is good, located in the middle of the mountain, with first -class night scenes.They also have special cars to pick up Passcheal, Ocean Park and Mountain Top Cable Car Station.We saved a toll and time.They also have their own small restaurants, and the things are quite delicious. They have SOUP and desserts for lunch.Afternoon tea is cheaper.In the ground in Central, this price is only this price.After we came down from the top of the mountain, we walked home, that is, about half an hour, passing Lan Guifang.Along the escalator, there are many snack restaurants. It is okay to eat. There are a few of them driving late. There are many guests in the middle of the night.There is also a very old name named Lianxianglou."
1,"帮家人订的,没什么好说的,香港的酒店嘛,有这样的性价比就可以了.","I booked it for my family. There is nothing to say. Hong Kong hotels, there is such a cost -effectiveness."
1,"房间设施还是不错的,非常齐全,非常舒服,也没有旧旧的感觉,不愧是NOVOTEL旗下的酒店.520的价格超级划算了.服务也不错,我的所有要求都得到了很快的回应.但是西环实在太远了,交通不太方便,附近也没有地铁,只能等一个钟头一班的酒店班车.搭TAXI就不划算了,一个来回随便就要100多.","The room facilities are still good, very complete, very comfortable, and there is no old feeling. It is indeed the price of Novotel's hotel. 520 is super cost -effective. The service is also good, all my requirements have been responded quickly. ButThe West Ring is too far away, the transportation is not convenient, and there is no subway nearby. You can only wait for the hotel's bus to take a while. It is not cost -effective to take TAXI."
1,在红火车站出来去过海巴士站坐101或104路巴士到皇后大道西就可以到达酒店门口了，车费不到十元港币，在尼敦路也有站上车，去酒店的交通其实很方便。酒店每小时有一班到中环和湾仔的免费穿梭巴士可以乘搭，可以去到金钟地铁站，湾仔码头，机场快线中环站，港澳码头等地，还可以让司机在沿路地点停车，司机很好说话，还会帮忙拿行李，从酒店去其他地方其实也很方便。在码头坐中星小轮去尖沙咀也不过两块钱。酒店门面小，不过里面装修在香港来说也确实是有四星级了，虽然房间不算太大，不过放两张双人床倒还不显得太局促，把飘台改成座位设计也挺实用，洗手间也相当不错，基本用品除了牙刷牙膏之外还是比较齐全的。酒店的服务可以打满分，毕竟是国际连锁的酒店，虽然是经济型的酒店，软件还是相当有水平。酒店周边其实购物吃饭也很方便，并不是以前某些点评里说的那样偏僻的地方，还是蛮繁忙的商业街。虽然标间窗外没什么景色，却也算安静。我拿的价格是506，这么低的价格陪这样的酒店素质，相当令人满意。,"Come out at the Red Railway Station and take the 101 or 104 bus to the west of Queen's Avenue to reach the entrance of the hotel. The fare is less than ten yuan.EssenceThere is one shift in the hotel every hour to the free shuttle buses in Central and Wan Chai. You can take it to the Golden Bell Subway Station, the Wan Chai Wharf, the Airport Express Central Station, the Hong Kong and Macau terminal, etc.Talking well, it will also help take your luggage. It is actually very convenient to go to other places from the hotel.Sitting in the pier, I took the Mid -Star and went to Tsim Sha Tsui for only two dollars.The hotel's facade is small, but there is indeed a four -star decoration in Hong Kong. Although the room is not too big, it is too cramped to put two double beds.The toilet is also quite good. Basic supplies are relatively complete in addition to toothbrush and toothpaste.The service of the hotel can be full. After all, it is an international chain hotel. Although it is an economical hotel, the software is still quite level.It is actually very convenient to eat and eat around the hotel. It is not as remote places in some comments before, or a busy commercial street.Although there is no scenery outside the bidding window, it is also quiet.The price I took is 506. Such a low price accompany such a hotel quality is quite satisfactory."
1,欧式简约装潢，有飘窗，可惜周围全是楼，大床是2张小床拼成的，可以看出小床很小，羽绒被、枕头，在跑马地住宅区，比较安静，周边超市、洗衣店多，餐厅一般，出门不易打车，有免费bus到时代广场等地，有收费机场穿梭巴士,"The European -style simple decoration has bay windows. Unfortunately, there are all buildings around, and the large bed is made of 2 small beds. It can be seen that the small bed is very small, down quilt, pillow, in the horseshill residential area, it is relatively quiet, the surrounding supermarkets, the surrounding supermarket, the surrounding supermarket,There are many laundry, the restaurant is average, it is not easy to take a taxi when you go out. There are free bus to Times Square and other places."
1,香港的酒店在面方面就不需要求什了家酒店施已比了，不交通比方便的服方面尚可,Hong Kong hotels do not need to ask for a hotel in terms of face.
1,今年第二次入住该酒店，这次和好友一起去HK购物，还是首选这间酒店，虽然，酒店离市区较远，但是，在尖沙嘴的半岛酒店那里有免费的班车（整点一趟）回酒店。酒店的房间很大，大约有二十几平方，我住了二次都是有无敌海景的房间，住入时选择靠游艇俱乐部这边的房间，都可以看到海，另外，六楼以下的房间还有一个露台，感觉非常好。酒店的早餐也非常丰富（值得一试），可以坐在露天的花园边上吃，吃完早餐去花园走走，感觉真的很好。出酒店不远的地方就是沙滩，酒店不远处也有7-11（24小时便利店），小超市（里面有新鲜的水果卖），还有一个吃东南亚菜的餐馆，名字不记得了。酒店唯一另人不太满意的地方就是房间内设施比较陈旧，不过洗手间是很不错的，有一个单独的沐浴间。如是你是一家去HK渡假，选这间酒店，一定错不了。,"I stayed at the hotel for the second time this year. This time I went to HK to shop with my friends. I am still choosing this hotel. Although the hotel is far away from the city, there are free shuttle bus at the Peninsula Hotel in Tsim Sha Tsui.) Back to the hotel.The hotel's room is very large, about twenty square meters. I lived in rooms with invincible sea views twice. When I lived in, I chose the room on the side of the yacht club.There is also a terrace in the room, which feels very good.The hotel's breakfast is also very rich (it is worth trying). You can sit on the open garden and eat. After eating breakfast and walking to the garden, it feels really good.Not far from the hotel is the beach. There are 7-11 (24 hours convenience stores) not far from the hotel. The small supermarket (there are fresh fruits for sale), and a restaurant eating Southeast Asian cuisine.The only place where the hotel is not very satisfied is that the facilities in the room are relatively old, but the toilet is very good. There is a separate bath room.If you are going to HK vacation, you will not be wrong to choose this hotel."
1,"房间档次和环境绝对5星.饭菜质量属于上等.只是离开市中心较远.不过酒店有班车.如能搭上班车,则十全十美.","The level of the room and the environment is absolutely 5 stars. The quality of the meal is the superior. It is far away from the city center. However, there are bus in the hotel."
1,"酒店离市区比较远,不过在尖沙嘴一个小时有一班车去酒店,房间内设施比较陈旧些,但是外部环境非常好,空气也很好,出酒店不远处就有沙滩,非常适合去渡假,早餐的品种也比较丰富.下次去还会去住,那里的环境真的非常好.比如心酒店好多了.","The hotel is far away from the city, but one hour in Tsim Sha Tsui has a bus to the hotel. The facilities in the room are relatively old, but the external environment is very good and the air is very good. There are beaches not far from the hotel.The breed of breakfast is also relatively rich. I will live next time, where the environment is really good. For example, the heart hotel is much better."
1,作为五星级酒店的硬件是差了点装修很久电视很小只是位置很好楼下是DFS对面是海港城但性价比不高,"As a five -star hotel, the hardware is a bit bad. The decoration is very small for a long time. The TV is very small. It ’s good. It’ s a good place. It ’s a good place."
1,22号到的香港，是觉得这个酒店地址还比较好，但是没想到很失望，当时在携程预订时说了不要低楼层和要大床房，但是到了前台被告知没接到过这些要求，好不容易换了个大床房也在3楼，窗子看出去是个平台，很压抑的感觉，卫生间有股很难闻的怪味道，电视机很小很破的那种，服务也不太好，反正我觉得有受骗的感觉。。。。,"Hong Kong arrived on the 22nd, I felt that the address of this hotel was better, but I did not expect it to be disappointed. When I was reservation in Ctrip, I said not to be low and big bed rooms, but I was told to receive these requirements at the front desk.It is easy to change a large bed room on the 3rd floor. The window sees that it is a platform. It feels very depressed. The bathroom has a unpleasant strange taste. The TV is very small and very broken. The service is not very good. AnywayI think I feel deceived.EssenceEssenceEssence"
1,"不错呀,房间够大,因为带了孩子,定的是TWINBED房,说了不要3,5楼,去的时候其他楼层的没房间了,前台主动安排大床房,免费加了一张床,态度满好的.","Yes, the room is big enough, because the child is brought, the Twinbed room is set, and the 3,5th floor is said. When you go, there are no rooms on the other floors. The front desk actively arranges a large bed room. A free bed is added.Full attitude."
1,不错，离大连港很近，步行几分钟就到了。坐船的游客很适合这个宾馆。挂的四星，感觉比三星多点，比四星少点。不过宾馆的价格还是对得起客人的。大连的如家快捷都得两百多呢。非常感动的是我们的船是早上四点多到大连湾的，码头的车送到火车站，然后我们自己打车到宾馆，时间大概是六点左右。非常担心这么早宾馆会不会让我们入住。忐忑不安的走进宾馆，前台只有一个服务员，态度非常亲切，一直都很温和，笑容很温暖。在确定了我们的预订并且有空房间后给我们办理了入住。这样我们得以休息了一个小时再外出赶往发现王国。这一个小时的休息非常重要和有效。,"Yes, it is very close to Dalian Port, and it takes a few minutes to walk.Tourists who take the boat are very suitable for this hotel.The four -star hanging feels more than Samsung and less than four stars.However, the price of the hotel is still worthy of guests.There are more than two hundred in Dalian's home.What was very moved was that our boat arrived at Dalian Bay at more than four in the morning. The car at the pier was taken to the train station, and then we took a taxi to the hotel by ourselves. The time was about six o'clock.I am very worried about whether the hotel will let us stay in this earlier.Walking into the hotel uneasily, there was only one waiter at the front desk, with a very kind attitude, always very gentle, and a warm smile.After confirming our booking and free room, we will check in.In this way, we can take a break for an hour before going out to find the kingdom.This hour's rest is very important and effective."
1,这家酒店的优点：便宜海景也很漂亮到海洋公园方便，楼下没多远就有空调大巴到公园门口，刷卡只6块多钱，比金钟到海洋公园的大巴还便宜几块钱。酒店服务人员很不错（门童将行李送到房间，忘记给消费，等他很有礼貌地走了之后我们才想起来，香港有给消费的习惯o(∩_∩)o...安顿好下楼找吃的地方，又碰到那位门童，人家还是很礼貌很客气的很耐心的解释应该怎样走，附近有些什么吃饭的地方。还有就是我们听说每天出去，要留10来块钱做小费给打扫的阿姨。可是等我们回来，那10块钱还是压在桌子上也）缺点：有些陈旧（房间小，咱就不计较了o(∩_∩)o...香港寸土寸金也）装潢设施、格调比迪斯尼的酒店也差很大很大几节，不过房间价位也便宜一半o(∩_∩)o...出行不是太方便，虽然有大巴什么的到各个地方，但香港的大巴是不报站的，我们坐在车上晕晕乎乎的，也不知道是到了什么地方。第二天出行只好打车到地铁站（不过起步价就能到地铁站）。在香港呀，只有坐地铁心里最踏实，知道身在何处。坐大巴过好几站了，你才能回过味了，哦！刚刚应该是到了~汗~所以下次再去香港也许会选择住地铁边上的酒店。,"The advantages of this hotel: The cheap sea view is also very beautiful to the ocean park. There is a air -conditioned bus to the gate of the park without much far downstairs. The card is only 6 yuan, which is a few dollars cheaper than the bus from Golden Bell to Ocean Park.The hotel service staff is very good (Men Tong sent his luggage to the room and forgot to give consumption. After he was politely left, we remembered that Hong Kong has the habit of consumption.When you go downstairs to find the place to eat, and meet the door child again, people are still very polite and polite to explain how to go, what are you eating nearby? And we heard that we went out every day and stayed 10 to stay 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to 10.Make a tip of the cream for the cleaning aunt. But when we come back, the 10 yuan is still pressed on the table.) The disadvantages: Some are old (the room is small, we don't care about O (∩_∩) o ... Hong Kong inch soil soil soil in Hong KongInch gold) decoration facilities and styles are very worse than that of Disney hotels, but the room price is half cheaper O (∩_∩) o ... Traveling is not too convenient, although there are buses or something to all places in various places in various places, But the bus in Hong Kong is not reported. We are dizzy in the car and we don't know where it is.The next day, I had to take a taxi to the subway station (but the starting price can be at the subway station).In Hong Kong, I only have the most practical in my heart and know where I am.After several stops, you can have the taste, oh!It should be here ~ Khan ~ So you may choose to stay on the subway next time you go to Hong Kong next time."
1,首先许多人说交通不便，那诸位真是坐惯地铁了，其实香港还是有很多地方并不在地铁站15分钟的步行范围内。不过离上环地铁站确实有10-15分钟的步行路程，像我们去香港天天要在各种商场里走到累个半死，回去酒店还要走10几分钟确实有点崩溃，不过，不过！有叮叮车和巴士可乘，晚上接近12点都还有，坐在叮叮车里晃荡晃荡的驶向终点是很有些意思的事情，不过要乘到中环，铜锣湾的话费时就有点太长了，所以早上出门之类的还是乘巴士或乘叮叮车到上环地铁站为佳。旁边有很多小餐馆，在其中几家吃过早餐，中西式兼有之，味道还不错，而且价钱便宜，可以学众位街坊买张报纸去看。附近也有那么两家百佳和屈臣氏和便利店，不过都很小。至于酒店房间，我们是没有那么好的运气被升级到全海景房，不过半海景房已经很让我们满意了，有个小冰箱，卫生间在香港的酒店里已经算豪华的了，海景无敌，很漂亮，我都想把玻璃敲碎来拍张照。床是两张单人床拼在一起。电视没几个频道，不过不影响，那几天有欧洲杯我还只看上一眼就睡着了。服务的话，很彬彬有礼，不过大堂里所有服务人员的普通话讲的都没英文好，门童会主动帮你拿行李到大堂。有个小插曲就是上去发现门卡开不了门，遂下去问。问完换过卡上来开门一看房里全是东西，只好又下去。结果发现是写错房号了，汗。也如各位所说的，每天把手上会有明报不过退房那天就没有。真是“让人温暖”的细节啊。房间打扫的很干净，很赞，把我随手乱放的贵重物品都摆得井井有条。总之住过之后GF就号称以后来香港就都要住这家了。交通虽然不便，其他方面却可以弥补。,"First of all, many people say that the traffic is inconvenient, and the people are really used to the subway. In fact, there are still many places in Hong Kong that are not within 15 minutes of walking in the subway station.However, there is indeed a 10-15 minutes walk from the Shanghuan subway station. Like we go to Hong Kong to go to various shopping malls every day, we will be tired and half-dead. It really takes a few minutes to go back to the hotel for 10 minutes.There are Ding Ding cars and buses. It is still nearly 12 o'clock in the evening. It is very interesting to sit in the dangling end of Ding Ding's driving to the end.Therefore, it is better to go out in the morning or the bus to go to the Sheung Wan subway station.There are many small restaurants next to them. Several of them have breakfast. They have both Chinese and Western style. The taste is good, and the price is cheap.There are also two Park and Watsons and convenience stores nearby, but they are very small.As for the hotel room, we are not so good luck to be upgraded to the full sea view room, but the seal seascape room is very satisfied. There is a small refrigerator. The bathroom is already luxurious in the hotel in Hong Kong.Beautiful, I want to break the glass to take a picture.The bed is spelling two single beds together.There are few channels on TV, but it does not affect. In those days, I just fell asleep at the European Cup.If the service is service, it is very polite, but the Mandarin of all service staff in the lobby is not English. Mennong will take the initiative to help you get your luggage to the lobby.There is an episode that goes to find that the door card can't open the door, so he goes down and ask.After asking the card, I opened the door and opened the door to see everything in the room, so I had to go down again.It turned out that I wrote the wrong house number, sweat.As you say, there will be a clear report every day but there will be no day without checking out.It's really ""warm"" details.The room was cleaned very clean and great, and the valuables that I put in the randomly were organized.In short, after living in GF, GF claims to live in Hong Kong in the future.Although the traffic is inconvenient, other aspects can be made up."
1,"酒店位置很好,适合旅游度假!房间马马虎虎,过的去了!服务一般!","The hotel location is very good, suitable for travel vacations! The room is sloppy, and I have passed! The service is average!"
1,"房间内环境还是不错的,就是上网有点贵,12块一个小时,还有门口修路,门前环境不好","The environment in the room is still good, that is, the Internet is a bit expensive, 12 pieces for an hour, and road repair at the door. The environment in front of the door is not good."
1,中山大酒店地理位置非常好，位于市中心，交通、购物、吃饭都很方便。房间很干净，只是面积稍小，特别是卫生间稍显局促。推荐38层旋转餐厅的自助俄式晚餐，99元一位，品种较多，味道不错，性价比较高。隆重推荐现场烤制的羊扒。18点开始逢整点有俄罗斯男女声双人组合合唱表演。唯一不满意的是双人标准间只提供一份早餐券，不够大气。酒店提供的免费早餐券有2种选择。建议不要去5层茶餐厅，早餐券只抵用30元，根本不够，超出部分不仅要付费，还要支付15％的价格调节税，味道也一般。推荐去38层旋转餐厅用早餐（凭早餐券免费，自费49元一位），品种和味道远远胜过5星级的泰达美爵的自助早餐。酒店比较有特色的是印度门童，还有大堂几只会说“你好”“谢谢”的鹩哥比较吸引孩子。,"Zhongshan Hotel is very good in geographical location. It is located in the center of the city, and it is convenient to transport, shopping, and eating.The room is very clean, but the area is slightly smaller, especially the bathroom is slightly cramped.Recommend 38 -story rotating restaurant self -service Russian dinner, 99 yuan, a variety of varieties, good taste, and high cost.Grandly recommend the sheep grilled on the spot.At 18 o'clock, there was a bilateral chorus performance of Russian men and women.The only dissatisfaction is that the two -person standard room only provides one breakfast coupon, which is not atmospheric.There are two options for free breakfast coupons provided by the hotel.It is recommended not to go to the 5 -storey tea restaurant. The breakfast coupon is only 30 yuan, which is not enough. It is not only paid by the excess, but also pays 15 % of the price to adjust taxes. The taste is average.It is recommended to go to the 38th floor to rotate the restaurant for breakfast (free breakfast coupons, pay 49 yuan for one person at your own expense). The variety and flavor are far better than 5 -star Tedda Misjo's buffet breakfast.The hotel is more distinctive in Indian door children, as well as a few lobby brothers who say ""hello"" and ""thank you"" are more attractive to children."
1,酒店的位置还是不错的，附近就有地铁站可通达各处，从机场过来想省钱的话坐A31就可以了，房间面积比较大，房间设施比较全，电吹风、电冰箱、保险箱、洗漱用品、面巾纸都有，关键是屋里有一个沙发床，带小童的话很方便。服务也很到位，整体来说性价比比较高。,"The location of the hotel is still good. There are subway stations nearby nearby. If you come from the airport, you can sit in A31 if you want to save money. The room area is relatively large and the room facilities are relatively complete.There are noodle towels. The key is that there is a sofa bed in the house. It is convenient to bring a child.The service is also in place, and the overall cost performance is relatively high."
1,上星期六第一次入住，感觉不错，常往来于省港澳，香港的酒店也住了不少，悦来是我住过的性价比最高的，房间在香港酒店来说是算大，也很干净，交通也很便利，20分钟到旺角，逛街购物也很方便，吃的很多。其实在香港购物不一定非得到旺角、铜锣湾，一般的商铺在荃湾也很齐全，价钱比旺角等便宜，除非你想购买真正的名牌就到中环。出差旅游只求一张干净实惠的床，悦来就是不错的选择,"I stayed in last Saturday and felt good. I often came to Hong Kong and Macau in provinces. Hong Kong hotels also lived a lot. Yuelai was the most cost -effective. The room was large and clean.Traffic is also very convenient. It is very convenient to go shopping in Mong Kok for 20 minutes.In fact, shopping in Hong Kong does not necessarily get Mong Kok and Causeway Bay. The general shops are also complete in Tsuen Wan. The price is cheaper than Mong Kok, unless you want to buy a real brand brand to Central.Find only a clean and affordable bed for business trips, Yuelai is a good choice"
1,刚刚结束4天的旅游行，在YMCA的三天我非常满意。首先是交通方便，出门口2分钟就是地铁口，而且这个油麻地站通两条地铁线。特别是早上可以坐地铁去吃粥，晚上再晚也不担心回不来。（这个地铁站到12;45分关门）再次就是干净，不知道是不是新装修的。墙面和床上靠垫的颜色非常协调。卫生间也够大。（相对于一般的香港酒店）我们住的房间是三角形的，卧室和卫生间的灯光配合房间的结构布置的很好。龙头出水量很大，还有挂壁的吹风机，保险箱，小冰箱。。都不错。还有是服务员的态度也很不错。可能是因为这是基督教会所属的酒店。所以每个迎面遇到的客人，都是面带微笑，感觉很亲切。总之有朋友去香港我一定会推荐这家，下次再去也会首选这家。,"I have just ended 4 days of tourism, and I am very satisfied in the three days of YMCA.The first is convenient transportation. It is the subway entrance for 2 minutes out of the door, and this Yau Ma Ma Di Station has two subway lines.Especially in the morning, you can take the subway to eat porridge, and you can not worry about returning at night.(This subway station reached 12; at 45 points closed) is clean again, I don't know if it is newly renovated.The color of the cushion on the wall and the bed is very coordinated.The bathroom is also big enough.(Compared to ordinary Hong Kong hotels) The room we live in is triangular. The lights of the bedroom and bathroom are well arranged with the structure of the room.The faucet is very water, as well as a hair dryer, a safe, and a small refrigerator.EssenceIt's all good.There is also a good attitude of the waiter.It may be because it is a hotel that belongs to the Christian Church.So every guest who meets on the face is smiling and feels kind.In short, a friend will recommend this one to Hong Kong, and the first choice will be the first to go next time."
1,酒店很干净，服务员会推荐我到女士无烟层，设施也比较好，餐厅的小点心味道也可以。吸取了之前美酒店不好停车的经验，在这的三天还是我比较满意的。,"The hotel is very clean. The waiter will recommend me to the lady's smokeless layer, the facilities are better, and the small snacks of the restaurant are also possible.I have learned about the experience of not parking before the hotel, and I am more satisfied in this three days."
1,"在那里住了2晚,觉得还是很不错的.首先办理入住手续时接待小姐的态度非常好,特别有礼貌和耐心,让人觉得很窝心,不像大陆的服务员爱理不理的.另外房间虽小了点但非常干净,在香港这个地方,对于三星级的酒店来说已经很不错了.酒店的地理位置很好,就在油麻地地铁站出口处,交通很方便,而且离女人街和通菜街都非常近,穿过对面小学旁边的小路就可到了.","I lived there for 2 nights, and I felt very good. First of all, when I went through the procedures for check -in, the lady's attitude was very good. It was particularly polite and patient.Although it is a bit smaller, it is very clean. In this place in Hong Kong, it is already very good for a three -star hotel. The hotel's geographical location is very good. It is at the exit of the Yau Ma Tei Metro Station.Tongcai Street is very close. You can get through the path next to the opposite elementary school."
1,感谢以前住过游客的点评，感觉确实不错。比想象中的房间大。卫生干净。离地铁站非常近。酒店的服务也比较到位。酒店内的自助早餐在当地来说比较超值。对面的生记粥品也推荐下，味道不错的。,"Thanks to the comments of tourists before, it feels good.Bigger than the imagined room.Hygiene.Very close to the subway station.The hotel's service is also in place.The buffet breakfast in the hotel is more value -for -money locally.The opposite Shengji porridge is also recommended, and it tastes good."
1,"此酒店地理位置不错,有点闹中取静的感觉,出门交通比较方便;最高兴的是酒店免费给我们升级到了最顶层的套房,太好了,有大大的客厅,房间也不小,在香港从未住过如此大房间的宾馆,连住了两天都不想离开,还想继续住下去,下次还会选择YMCA","This hotel has a good geographical location. It feels a little bit of quiet, and it is more convenient to go out. The happiest is that the hotel has upgraded us to the top suites for free. It is great. There are large living rooms.I have never lived in such a large room, and I didn't want to leave for two days. I also wanted to continue to live. I will choose YMCA next time I will choose YMCA"
1,地段好，到九龙坐酒店门口的天星小轮很方便，坐地铁沿着天桥走就到了，一点不用晒太阳，熟悉天桥，长廊走法的人，住在那里很是方便，四通八达。服务也不错，这次订了两间房，还给升级住了海景房，真得不错啊。下次去还回选这家。,The location is good. It is very convenient to go to the stars at the door of the hotel at the door of the hotel. It will arrive along the bridge along the subway. You do n’t have to bask in the sun at all. People who are familiar with the bridge.The service is also good. I booked two rooms this time and also upgraded to the sea view room. It was really good.I will return to this one next time.
1,海景是其一大卖点，但房间面积偏小，离地铁站不近，打的到机场360港币。服务也算不错，门童和蔼可亲，当然给小费的话更是让你有皇帝的感觉。招呼“的士”的“老爷爷”几年来一直打扮得象“红头阿三”，不知是算有创意还是没创意？但老实说他还是蛮敬业的！走到地铁估计10-15分钟（但没一本正经走过，大概罢了）。走天桥可以到新宏基三楼“海都酒楼”饮茶，味道一级，据说朱熔基总理也去吃过饭（楼下服务台说的）！,"The sea view is a big selling point, but the room is small, not close to the subway station, and it is 360 Hong Kong dollars at the airport.The service is also good. The door children are amiable. Of course, if you give tips, you feel like emperor.The ""Grandpa"" who greets the ""taxi"" has been dressing up like ""Red Head A San"" for a few years. I wonder if it is creative or without creativity?But honestly he is still professional!It is estimated to be 10-15 minutes to the subway (but none of them walked seriously, probably).You can drink tea at the ""Haidu Restaurant"" on the third floor of Xinhongji on the flyover. It tastes first. It is said that Premier Zhu Rongji has also went to eat meals (the service desk downstairs)!"
1,早餐非常不错。房间条件还好，就是电视太小。周围非常方便。赶上八点半结账，等了超过十分钟。,"Breakfast is very good.The conditions of the room are okay, that is, the TV is too small.It is very convenient around.Catch the checkout at 8:30 and waited for more than ten minutes."
1,5月底入住的。房间装修感觉还不错，就是房间小了点，大床居然还是两张床拼起来的，有点奇怪。地理位置不错，正对着会展中心，离湾仔地铁站也只需要过四条马路，离骆克道上的酒吧也比较近，特别是去九龙的话下楼就是天星轮的码头，很方便。酒店每天会送一个小玩具，虽然很简单，但是几天的攒在一起可以摆出很多造型，一直玩到现在，不知道下次去的时候还会不会送。酒店的餐厅比较一般，价格也贵，还不如去地铁站骆克道或者柯布达道上的几家茶餐厅来的实惠。游泳池很好，可惜开的时间短了点，要是晚上也开夜光场的话就更好了大堂的结账比较怪异，结账的时候取消信用卡授信额度居然不撕小票，有点不习惯，不知道是不是这个酒店的一贯做法……还是香港的惯例？,"Check in at the end of May.The decoration of the room feels good, but the room is a bit smaller, and the big bed is still fighting in two beds, which is a bit strange.The geographical location is good. It is facing the exhibition center. It only needs four roads from the Wan Chai Metro Station. It is also closer to the bar on the Locke Road. Especially when you go to Kowloon, you will go downstairs to be the dock of Tianxing Wheel, which is very convenient.The hotel will send a small toy every day. Although it is very simple, a lot of shapes can be placed together for a few days. I have been playing until now. I do n’t know if it will be delivered next time.The hotel's restaurant is relatively average and expensive. It is better to go to the Metro Station Locke Road or several tea restaurants on the Kabuda Road.The swimming pool is very good, but unfortunately the opening time is a bit short.The consistent practice of this hotel ... or is it the practice of Hong Kong?"
1,这家酒店性价比还是很高的，入住的是行政楼层单人间，给客户订的是行政楼层双人间，酒店内硬件设施很好，免费宽带上网，早餐丰盛，而且酒店更准备了免费的行政楼层下午茶和晚间鸡尾酒，虽然由于时间紧没有享用到，但给人感觉非常好。员工也很热情，服务也好。酒店距离地铁也很近，而且和一家商场紧邻，购物也很方便。唯一的缺点是我办理入住手续时，大堂办理速度比较慢，我排了将近30分钟队后被告知是行政楼层房间可以到行政楼层接待处直接办理入住手续。哎，如果能够在酒店里有直接说明就不用排这么久了。很辛苦啊~综合评价，我还是比较满意，尤其能令客户满意我也很有面子。,"This hotel is still very cost -effective. The administrative floor is a single room in the administrative floor. The dual room of the administrative floor is booked for customers. The hardware facilities in the hotel are very good, free broadband access to the Internet, breakfast is rich, and the hotel has prepared a free administrative floor.Afternoon tea and the evening cocktail, although it was not enjoyed because of the tight time, it felt very good.Employees are also very enthusiastic and service.The hotel is very close to the subway, and it is close to a mall, and it is very convenient to shop.The only disadvantage was that when I checked in, the lobby was slower. After I lined up for nearly 30 minutes, I was told that the administrative floor room could go to the administrative floor reception office to go directly to the check -in procedure.Hey, if there is a direct explanation in the hotel, you don't have to rank so long.Very hard ~ Comprehensive evaluation, I am still satisfied, especially to satisfy customers. I am also very face."
1,免费升级到行政房，每次去都住这里。设备、空间在香港来说是一流的,"Upgrade to the administrative house for free, live here every time.Equipment and space are first -class in Hong Kong"
1,"我订的是高级间，因为不吸烟，很幸运的升级到行政楼18楼，房间很大,服务人员很亲善，比九龙酒店（房间小，服务人员没笑容）好太多，感觉很好,下次还会来帝京住的.","I booked a high -level room, because I do n’t smoke, I am lucky to upgrade to the 18th floor of the administrative building. The room is very large and the service staff is very good. It is much smaller than the Kowloon Hotel (the room, the service staff does not smile).I will come to Emperor Jing next time."
1,酒店的环境好，交通也方便，服务人员的素质和态度更是一流！这次去给我们免费升级到商务间，房间又大又漂亮！下次去我们一定还会选择它！,"The hotel's environment is good, the transportation is also convenient, and the quality and attitude of the service staff are first -class!This time, I will upgrade to the business room for free, and the room is big and beautiful!We will choose it next time!"
1,1.房间设施看得出来是比较久远了，但非常非常干净，润肤霜、沐浴露和洗发膏质量都不错，比很多5星要好，且味道很好闻2.地理位置就是坐落在商业中心，【强烈推荐】出了酒店大门往左绕到酒店后面的小路上，有一家【章鱼小丸子】，他家的鸡肉串和小丸子非常好吃，只是门面非常小，生意非常好。,"1. The room facilities can see that it is relatively long, but it is very very clean. The quality of moisturizing cream, shower gel and shampoo is better than many 5 stars, and the taste is good. 2. The geographical location is located in business.In the center, [strong recommendation] Out of the hotel's door to the left to the road behind the hotel, there is a [octopus small balls]. His chicken skewers and small balls are very delicious, but the facade is very small and the business is very good."
1,房间还行，交通也方便，当然火车站周边略显嘈杂，总体还行。,"The room is okay, and the transportation is convenient. Of course, the surroundings of the railway station are slightly noisy, and it is okay."
1,酒店地理位置方便，服务也不错，而且我们订的房间含接送车服务，很实惠。缺点是房间偏小，而且下面就是香港殡仪馆,"The hotel is convenient and the service is good, and the room we order contains car delivery services, which is very affordable.The disadvantage is that the room is small, and the following is the Hong Kong funeral home"
1,很不错的酒店。干洗的衣服还会注明哪里有油点，哪里开线了。而且都已经做了相应的处理！！！！很是感谢！！风景没得说，很不错！房间很仿古，舒服！下次还会住这里。,"Very good hotel.The dry cleaning clothes will also indicate where there are oils and where the line is opened.And it has been dealt with accordingly!IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionThank you very much!IntersectionThe scenery has to be said, very good!The room is antique and comfortable!I will live here next time."
1,酒店位置好，环境可以，房间就是小了点，不过出差住在这里是很不错的选择。,"The hotel location is good, the environment is okay, the room is a little small, but it is a good choice to live here."
1,大床房还不错，其他的没有看过。位置很好。希望菜做得更好吃,"The big bed room is not bad, and the others have not been seen.The location is very good.I hope the dishes are better"
1,1.地理位置不错2.早餐中等偏上3.网速一般在长春还算物有所值,1. Good geographical location 2. Breakfast is medium and medium. 3. The network speed is generally worth it in Changchun
1,地理位置：正对长春火车站，优点：方便乘火车的朋友，缺点：感觉环境有点乱，物价较高，但周围各种饭店很多。房间：大小一般，被褥比较干净，离马路有点远，晚上比较安静。卫生间马桶和浴缸有点旧旧的感觉。隔音一般，走廊没有地毯。我们正对电梯，所以电梯停靠和人声比较嘈杂。含双早，种类比较丰富。服务：中规中矩，没什么特色，门童是女的。,"Geographical location: It is facing the Changchun Railway Station. Advantages: Friends who are convenient for trains. Disadvantages: I feel that the environment is a bit messy and the price is high, but there are many restaurants around them.Room: The size is average, the bedding is relatively clean, a little far from the road, and relatively quiet at night.The bathroom toilet and bathtub feel a bit old.The sound insulation is average, and there is no carpet in the corridor.We are facing the elevator, so the elevator stops and the human voice is noisy.Contains double early, rich in variety.Services: There are no characteristics, the door children are women."
1,距离火车站非常近，走路5分钟就能到，在市中心，去哪个地方，交通都比较方便。入住比较晚，晚上10点钟左右，想订餐被告知下班了，想到宾馆小卖部买点方便面，没想到也关门，这一点不太方便。房间还行。,"It is very close to the railway station. It can be available for 5 minutes. In the city center, wherever you go, traffic is more convenient.Checking is relatively late. At about 10 o'clock in the evening, I wanted to order meals and was told to get off work. I thought of buying a small noodle in the hotel's shop. I did not expect to be closed. This is not convenient.The room is okay."
1,这里可以让我们三个人住一间房，而且服务员还主动多给我们一份浴室套装。一次性的浴室用品质量还是不错的。房间是小些，但是装璜上有很多人性化设计，老妈很喜欢。服务台前还有一块板上，写着从这家店到各各景点所要乘坐的公交车，方便游客的出行。不过这家店的位置有些偏，我是因为这家店离“留园”很近，才定的这家。,"Here we can allow the three of us to live in a room, and the waiters also take the initiative to give us an extra bathroom suit.The quality of one -time bathroom supplies is still good.The room is smaller, but there are many humanized designs in the decoration, and my mother likes it very much.There is also a board in front of the service desk, with a bus from this shop to various attractions to facilitate the travel of tourists.However, the location of this store is somewhat biased. I was set by this store because of this store."
1,"酒店位置不错,不过靠近马路有点吵闹,因为窗户不是双层的服务员比较热情,当时要一个电热壶很快就送到房间里了建议酒店注意枕套的干净程度","The location of the hotel is good, but it is a bit noisy near the road, because the windows are not enthusiastic about the two -storey waiter. At that time, I had to send an electric pot to the room soon."
1,"亚运村地区,以这个价格,还是相当不错的.交通方便,楼下的酒楼很有特点(味道江湖),日日客满,8:00PM以后有表演,相当不错,来晚了占不到座位.","The Asian Games Village area is still quite good at this price. The transportation is convenient. The restaurants downstairs are very characteristic (flavored). It is full of every day. After 8: 00pm, there will be performances. It is quite good."
1,一般情况吧!这个价位的能有这样的硬件条件也算不错了!适合情人约会不想花大钱的!,"Generally, it is good to have such a hardware condition at this price! Suitable for lovers and do not want to spend a lot of money!"
1,房间不错，虽然有点小，但很实用。宽带很快。不过前面的朋友说过的隔音效果差，确实有点。细察发现是门后的墙，采用木板结构。其它的都不错。早餐再普通不过。可以忽略了。,"The room is good, although it is a bit small, but it is very practical.Broadband is fast.However, the sound insulation effect mentioned in the previous friends is really a bit poor.It was found that it was a wall behind the door, using a wooden board structure.The others are good.Breakfast is not ordinary.It can be ignored."
1,相对价格而言，很不错。可是我订的商务大床房间隔音太差，隔壁房间电话声音、咳嗽声等清清楚楚，太没私密空间了。,"Relatively speaking, it is very good.However, the large -scale business in the big bedroom I booked was too poor. The sound of the phone, the sound of cough next door, and the sound of cough were clear. There was too private space."
1,是一家很实惠的酒店，交通方便，房间也宽敞，晚上没有电话骚扰，住了两次，有一次住５０１房间，洗澡间排水不畅通，也许是个别问题．服务质量很好，刚入住时没有调好宽带，服务员很快就帮忙解决了．,"It is a very affordable hotel. The transportation is convenient and the room is also spacious. There is no phone harassment at night. I lived twice. I lived in Room 501 once. The drainage in the bathroom was not smooth. Maybe it was an individual problem.The quality of the service was very good. When I first moved, the broadband was not adjusted, and the waiter quickly helped solve it."
1,我是第一次来这家酒店入住，总体感觉不错。这里的员工都很热情，房间也是新装修的，很安静、也很舒适。这里的交通非常便利，四通八达的。房间里的液晶电视、科勒卫浴、纯毛地毯、宜家家具。。。。。。给人的感觉很上档次，有品位！而且，上网还是2M独享，还不要钱，超值啊！！！强烈推荐朋友们来这家酒店入住！,"I came to this hotel for the first time, and I felt good overall.The employees here are very enthusiastic, the room is also newly renovated, very quiet and comfortable.The transportation here is very convenient, and it is in all directions.LCD TVs, Kohler bathroom, pure hair carpet, IKEA furniture in the room.EssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceIt feels very high -level and tasteful!Moreover, it is exclusive to surf the Internet. Do n’t need money, great value!IntersectionIntersectionStrongly recommend friends to come to this hotel!"
1,"酒店的地理位置很优越，客房是经过新装修的，很舒适，也很安静，服务员的服务也是相当热情。他们是商务酒店，在附近几家宾馆、酒店里算是性价比最高的了。很值得推荐给朋友。下次来北京还住这里。补充点评2008年1月22日：他们酒店房间里的设施还是蛮不错的，尤其是宽带上网的速度很快，卫浴是科勒的，不错。液晶电视的收视效果还不错。这次来北京是出差,由于酒店的出行方便,事情办得很顺利.有些不足的地方就是门口的标志不太醒目,不过听说他们有自己的写字楼,整体的标识倒是很容易就能找到.","The geographical location of the hotel is very superior. The guest rooms are newly renovated, very comfortable, and quiet, and the serviceman's service is quite enthusiastic.They are business hotels, and they are the most cost -effective in several nearby hotels and hotels.It is worth recommending to friends.I will live here next time in Beijing.Supplementary comment on January 22, 2008: The facilities in their hotel rooms are still pretty good, especially the speed of broadband Internet access is fast. The bathroom is Kohler, which is good.LCD TV's viewing effect is not bad.This time, it is a business trip to Beijing. Because the hotel's travel is convenient, things are smooth. Some of the shortcomings are that the sign of the door is not very eye -catching, but I heard that they have their own office buildings. The overall logo can easily find it."
1,房间超大，不是一般的大。哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈补充点评2008年8月11日：周围吃东西的地方比较少。,"The room is too large, not ordinary.Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha -supplement reviews on August 11, 2008: There are fewer places to eat around."
1,"三人间，房间很宽敞，卫生间不大，但都很干净。三楼的胡同设计很别具匠心。只是早餐结束的时间太早.九点钟去餐厅正赶上服务员收视最后一张桌子.附近特色小吃很多.斜对门的小饭店半夜三点多还营业,饭菜汤面很可口,也很便宜,只是忘记饭店的名字了.","In the three people, the rooms are spacious, the bathrooms are not large, but they are clean.The hutong design on the third floor is very ingenious.It's just that the breakfast is too early. Going to the restaurant at nine o'clock is catching up with the waiter to watch the last table. There are many nearby snacks nearby. The small restaurant with obliquely paid the door is more than three o'clock in the middle of the night.Forget the name of the restaurant."
1,我是在网上预订中煤的2007年8月22日-8月25日在宾馆住了3天。感觉在旅游旺季在秦皇岛3星级的宾馆每天240的价格是非常物有所值的，每天早起每人15元的自助餐花样较多吃的相当不错，干净卫生，住宿环境非常好，虽然离相关的旅游景点较远，但交通还是便利的出门做9路车4站地到火车站，而且车的班次非常快1～2分钟就能等上车，价格很有优势。去其他的景点做9路到四道桥到车也非常方便，前台的服务人员热情。,"I booked CICC on August 22-August 25, 2007, 2007, 2007.It feels that the price of 240 at the 3 -star hotel of Qinhuangdao in the tourist season is very worthwhile every day. The spoils of 15 yuan per person every day are pretty good, clean and hygienic, and the accommodation environment is very good.The tourist attractions are far away, but the transportation is still convenient to go out to do 9 cars and 4 stops to the railway station, and the cars can wait for the car in 1 to 2 minutes very fast. The price is very advantageous.It is also very convenient to go to other scenic spots to go to the Si Road Bridge to the car. The service staff at the front desk enthusiastically."
1,中煤大厦在同价位的酒店中，个人感觉性价比还可以。只是我住的房间临街，晚上比较吵。,"In a hotel at the same price, CNMC feels that it is okay.It's just that the room I live is on the street, and it is more noisy at night."
1,地理位置实在是好。我住的是单人大床房，进屋一看竟然跟套房一样，不过一个小屋有桌子和电视，另一个小屋只能放下一张床和电视，实在小得可怜。因为工作所以没有在酒店吃早餐，但是对面的郝刚刚羊杂割的确让人印象深刻，唯一的遗憾就是只有中午开门，晚上不营业……我想在酒店的商务中心买飞机票，竟然被告知不能刷卡，只能现金结帐，因此没买成，不爽！,"The geographical location is really good.I live in a single -person bedroom. When I entered the house, I saw the same as a suite, but one hut had tables and TVs, and the other could only put down one bed and TV. It was very small.Because of work, I did n’t have breakfast at the hotel, but the opposite Hao Ganggang sheep was really impressive. The only regret was to open the door at noon and did n’t open it at night ... I want to buy a plane ticket at the hotel ’s business center, and I was informed that I was informed that I was informed.Can't swipe the card, you can only check out cash, so you are not bought, unhappy!"

0,服务态度极其差，前台接待好象没有受过培训，连基本的礼貌都不懂，竟然同时接待几个客人；大堂副理更差，跟客人辩解个没完，要总经理的电话投诉竟然都不敢给。要是没有作什么亏心事情，跟本不用这么怕。,"The service attitude is extremely poor. It seems that the front desk has not been trained. I do n’t even understand the basic politeness. I even received several guests at the same time.Give.If you don't do anything, don't be so afraid of it."
0,我这次是第5次住在长春的雁鸣湖大酒店。昨晚夜里停电。深夜我睡着了。我的钱包被内贼进入我的房间，偷了我近1000元和4张信用卡。。。我的证件和外币，数码相机等都在房间的保险箱里，原封不动。我打了好几个小时的长途电话来处理我的信用卡的冻结。我报案了，这个4星酒店的保安摄像探头竟然坏了，没有修理！保安还查房卡入门时间，就是没有其他人在深夜进入我的房间。难道内贼不会用其他高明的方式进入吗？我的羽绒服也被这个内贼放在地上！我醒来时没有多想！近中午时我才发觉钱包少了现金和信用卡！还有，这家酒店的态度很差！没有同情心！我之前授权的2000元，我打了国际电话，银行说两天前我入酒店的2000元授权了，可是酒店的财务不领情，说中国银行没有授权。我又打了国际电话，我的银行说通过了！这家4星级的酒店不负责，认为不可能发生，我报案了，我下次再也不住这个1星不到的服务态度，很可耻！我还要把这个事件说给那些想定这个酒店的住客。酒店为何停电，摄像头坏得也太凑巧了来让大家知道这种内贼行为是要强力打击的。好了，不说了！！！千元丢了小事。酒店的处理态度我很反感！我强力告诉大家和提醒其他人不要到该酒店！,"This time I lived in the Yanming Lake Hotel in Changchun for the fifth time.Power outage last night.I fell asleep late at night.My wallet was entered my room by the inside thief and stole me nearly 1,000 yuan and 4 credit cards.EssenceEssenceMy documents and foreign currencies, digital cameras, etc. are in the safe of the room.I called for several hours to handle the freezing of my credit card.I reported the case.

I report the case. I ca n’t live in the service attitude of less than one star next time.

0,"我每次从合肥回台湾前一晚为搭机方便而住了五次该店,一次比一次差,checkin速度之慢,职员还互相聊天.房间照明远远不足,网速慢,态度差,浴室连淋浴间都省了，只剩一块子。更离谱的是住酒店晚上12点居然切断空调，而且11才通知，让我酒店都来不及。望江反正会议多，机关人员住的多，不在乎我们这些散户。下次要入住的朋友注意了！","Every night I returned from Hefei to Taiwan, I lived five times for the convenience of the plane.

0,对于我来说，12月10日是我最难熬的一天。一个四星级的酒店在温度只有13度的夜晚竟然不开空调，而且还是酒店的规定（内部文件规定），真是闻所未闻。我不知道是因为没有客人所以不开空调，还是因为不开空调就没有了客人，希望酒店多多反省。我只想建议携程尽快将该酒店的协议废除，以免其他客人受苦，影响携程的信誉。冻了一夜的白金贵宾,"For me, December 10 is my hardest day.A four -star hotel does not turn on the air conditioner at night at a temperature of only 13 degrees, and it is still unheard of the hotel's regulations (internal documents).I don't know if there is no guest, or there is no guest because they do not turn on the air conditioner.

0,周末住了一晚，酒店周边还是可以的，出行很方便~周日去花果山景区，打车25元就可以到；房间的话设施老了，空调漏了一个晚上的水！单人间卫生间很简陋~20元的自助早餐也就5元的水平~总体来说，要求不高的话就只能随便住住的地。,"I stayed for one night on the weekend. It is still possible to travel around the hotel. It is very convenient to travel. Go to Huaguo Mountain Scenic Area on Sunday and take a taxi for 25 yuan.

0,去的时候已经很晚了，在大厅叫了好几声才有一个服务员从前台后面爬起来，帮忙办理了入住手续。进到房间后发现房间的设施非常简陋，霉味也非常大。第二天早上起来才仔细看了一下房间，比起如家等快捷酒店差远了，说是三星的酒店，但距离三星不是差一点点。。。根本对不起220的价格，最多也就值100多一点点。,"It was very late when I went. After several times in the lobby, a waiter got up from the back of the front desk to help go through the procedures for check -in.After entering the room, I found that the facilities in the room were very simple and the moldy smell was very large.The next morning, I took a closer look at the room.

0,前台服务超差，基本的笑容都没有，看都不看你，连招待所都不如，很明显四星级的牌子是买回来的。房间装修也很一般，幸亏价钱还不算很高，但这样的服务就算高了。住了两次，没有任何改观的迹象，下次不住它了！,"The front desk service is super worse, there is no basic smile, I do n’t look at you, not even as much as the guest house.

0,"国庆期间住过本酒店，我的评价就是""差,实在实际太差"".第一:毛巾不仅仅是旧,而是破,有一个个洞洞.第二洗浴水龙头出水小，小得可怜。第三房间噪音很大，三楼的KTV一直吵到晚上12点。第四：早餐几乎没有东西可吃。第五结帐查房动作实在太慢，我们一共等了半小时多。还有很多很多的差。可以说比不上我们宁波的二星级酒店。补充点评2007年10月8日：这样的酒店携程订，标准间居然还要420元一间。自己直接订，要580元一间。超不值！！","During the National Day, I have lived in this hotel.

0,客观说，不怎么样的酒店。我是1月11日住的，天气特别冷，房间空调根本就不管用，我在房间待了4个小时手脚冰凉，最后没有办法打电话投诉，给我加了个电暖气，效果没变化。最气愤的是，我没听说过哪个酒店要变更或者取消，必须在15：00前联系，不联系就从你信用卡里扣钱。我订了2间房，3个早餐，由于青岛天气的原因，我的朋友没去成，我在下午4点半取消了一个房间和2个早餐，但是结帐时却收我2份早餐钱。我已经在下午通知携程了，携程也答复我通知酒店了。可酒店前台就是不承认收到通知，我不在乎那60元，是觉得态度真的不能理解。但是酒店司机的态度很好，我感谢酒店的司机师傅和礼宾部的人。反正以后不会在住这里了，青岛有好多好酒店，我自己也遗憾为什么选择这里。地理位置也不好，离海也远，就是去超市近点。,"Objectively speaking, not very good hotels.I lived on January 11th. The weather was particularly cold. The room air conditioner was not used at all. I stayed in the room for 4 hours and my hands and feet were cold. In the end, I couldn't call to complain. I added an electric heating to me. The effect was not changed.The most angry thing is that I haven't heard of which hotel to change or cancel it. You must contact it before 15:00. If you do n’t contact, you deduct money from your credit card.I booked 2 rooms and 3 breakfast. Due to the weather in Qingdao, my friend did not go to.EssenceI have informed Ctrip in the afternoon, and Ctrip also answered me to inform the hotel.But the hotel's front desk does not acknowledge the notice. I don't care about the 60 yuan, I feel that the attitude is really unclear.But the hotel driver has a good attitude.Anyway, I won't live here anymore. There are many good hotels in Qingdao. I regret why I choose here myself.The geographical location is not good, and it is far from the sea, just to go to the supermarket."
0,优点就不说了，说说缺点吧。1、前台的POS机真的该换换了，刷卡慢的出奇。1、前台服务员态度也不是很好。3、太吵，最要命的缺点，一个宾馆主要的功能时能提供相对安静的环境，可是住在这里实在吵得要命，联系前台提出置之不理。4、没有全天的暖气，实在搞笑，问前台说要五点以后才提供，这样的大酒店我想和小旅社都有区别，小旅社还提供24小时暖气呢。真的搞笑。,"The advantages are not to mention, let's talk about the shortcomings.1. The POS machine at the front desk should really be changed, and the card is surprisingly swiping.1. The attitude of the front desk is not very good.3. Too noisy, the most terrible disadvantage, the main functions of a hotel can provide a relatively quiet environment, but living here is really noisy, contacting the front desk to propose to ignore it.4. There is no heating throughout the day, it is really funny. Ask the front desk to provide it after five o'clock. I want to be different from the small hostel. The small hostel also provides 24 hours of heating.Really funny."
0,十月二日晚入住，前台小姐态度冷淡，到了三楼的标房没有电梯，走廊很闷热（没有空调），房间内设备陈旧，没有吹风机，就是招待所的标准，哪是三星级的宾馆哦！晚上吃了饭回宾馆，１０点左右宾馆已关门，没有服务人员，要自己叫开门，晕死，就这个服务，还收４９０的房费．不建议去天目湖的游人选择这个宾馆，物不所值啊！,"In the evening of October 2nd, the lady at the front desk was cold. There were no elevators on the benchmarks on the third floor. The corridor was very hot (no air conditioning). The equipment in the room was old. There was no hair dryer.IntersectionAt night, I went back to the hotel. At about 10 o'clock, the hotel was closed. There was no service personnel.

0,很少上来点评，但是为了让大家有个正确地认识，我愿意花点时间来点评下：我的建议是请你选择别的酒店，因为此酒店较陈旧，最重要的是房间的隔音效果非常差，我本人非常的不适应，当然如果您对噪音觉得无所谓的话，此酒店还是可以的。,"Rarely commented, but in order to let everyone have a correct understanding, I am willing to spend some time commented: My suggestion is to ask you to choose other hotels, because this hotel is more old.Bad, I am very uncomfortable. Of course, if you feel indifferent to noise, this hotel is still possible."
0,酒店不像是五星的，最多三星标准，比较失望，两个房间的海景只能看到一个角，而且服务意识都没有，我们两个房间都忘了东西，结果都到蓬莱了还没人联系我们。打电话想让他们寄回来，结果都在踢皮球，闹了半天还得回去拿。郁闷~~,"The hotel is not like five -star.

0,刚回成都没有地方住，就只有在等朋友最近的地方定了紫薇。去之前很担心，因为该酒店的评价一直不是很好。到了大堂果然失望，服务人员就像刚从周围打工市场招来的，连衣服都不怎么干净！态度还很冷淡！房间里面最大的缺点就是设计问题。阳台的玻璃门打不开，整个房间没有办法透气，很闷！！不过早餐还将就，服务还可以，才算得上四星级的酒店，其他的，真的很让人失望，大家最好还是不要去的好！！,"As soon as I returned to Chengdu, there was no place to live in Chengdu, so I only settled in Ziwei in the place where friends were waiting.I was worried before going, because the hotel's evaluation has not been very good.It was really disappointed in the lobby. The service staff was just like what had just recruited from the surrounding migrant market. Even clothes were not very clean!The attitude is still very cold!The biggest disadvantage in the room is the design problem.The glass door on the balcony cannot be opened.

0,赞成前面的点评，我是第一次住这边，房间设置很不合理，卫生间超级变态，不推荐入住！我出差经常住玉皇阁北街那边的玉皇阁酒店，地理位置好，是闹中取静的好地方，标间才150左右，还有游泳池，可以免费游泳，觉得性价比挺高。携程上没有，出租车司机都知道的。强烈建议携程把这家酒店也收录进去。,"In favor of the previous comments, I lived here for the first time. The room settings are very unreasonable. The bathroom is super perverted. It is not recommended to stay!I often live in the Jade Huangge Hotel on the North Street of Yuhuangge.

You can swim free.There is no on the Ctrip, and the taxi driver knows it.It is strongly recommended that Ctrip also includes this hotel."
0,我本来是订的220元的标间，后来告诉我只有258元的标间。只好答应、别无选择。以为在这种档次的城市，外标300多元的房间会不错，实际入住后，感觉性价比较差，设施简陋，不像能代表该市形象的窗口。空调是中央控制，房间内不可以调整，刚进房间有异味。这也是我两年来唯一遇到的在宾馆入住、还要另外缴纳10元停车费的！可能是我们少见多怪吧。优点：早餐还好，符合20元的标准。补充点评2008年6月8日：建议把地址改为“六峰路”，这样开车好找！,"I originally booked a 220 yuan standard room, and later told me that there was only 258 yuan standard room.I had to promise, no choice.I think that in this kind of cities, more than 300 yuan in the bids will be good. After actual staying, it feels that the price is poor and the facilities are simple, unlike the window that can represent the image of the city.The air conditioner is controlled by the central government. It cannot be adjusted in the room.This is also the only thing I have met in the hotel in the past two years, and I have to pay a 10 yuan parking fee!Maybe we are rare and weird.Advantages: Breakfast is fine, which meets the standard of 20 yuan.Supplementary comment on June 8, 2008: It is recommended to change the address to ""Liufeng Road"" so that you can find it!"

The appearance tube has been aging. When the screen is mainly played, the TV will not see anything. We can only see the white horizontal bar.IntersectionEnvironment: What kind of environment can there be in such a room?Service: Even the waiter hasn't recruited it yet!Most waiters responded slowly, and there was no habitual politeness in the telephone communication. After the phone was finished, there was no one goodbye to hang up, and you dizzy. I do n’t know if she agrees with your requirements.Seeing the guests like a stranger, the door of the door did not.Summary: If it wasn't for colleagues, I would definitely change to other hotels.Join all brothers who are on a business trip, prefers to live in hotels like home, and do not live here, it will only be worse than you think, not better than you think!I feel very sad about Ctrip's recommendation!It is estimated that there are many rebates given by this hotel. This kind of Ctrip recommendation will only cause me not to believe Ctrip in the future!And tell my colleagues, don't believe Ctrip!I want to say: The interests of deception cannot be long, no difference and drinking thirst!"
0,酒店有异味，无空调，给人的整体感觉很破旧，根本不能称为四星,"The hotel has a odor, no air conditioning, and the overall feeling of people is very worn. It can’t be called four stars at all"
0,这是我在携程定过的酒店中最差的，价钱又贵，以后不会再住了。,"This is the worst in the hotel I have set in Ctrip, and the price is expensive, and I won't live anymore in the future."
0,酒店服务不好，服务员态度生硬，特别是酒店物品管理方面，物品的清点不到位，我明明没有用房间内的收费物品，可是退房的时候硬说我们用了四包收费的洗液，非要我给钱，我因为急着赶飞机只好付款，简直不敢相信这是携程推荐的酒店，难道这家酒店就靠这样挣钱，有到了黑店的感觉。补充点评2008年3月24日：还有洗澡用的是电热水器，始终让我觉得不安全，提心吊胆。卫生间马桶不好用，修过一次也不好。总之，住在这家酒店觉得很别扭，觉得不安全，不舒服。四周感觉很吵。,"The hotel service is not good, and the waiter's attitude is strong, especially in terms of hotel items management.If I give me money, I had to pay because I was in a hurry to catch the plane. I couldn't believe that this was a hotel recommended by Ctrip. Is this hotel earn money by this, and it feels like a black shop.Supplementary comment on March 24, 2008: There is also an electric water heater for bathing, which always makes me feel unsafe and bare.The bathroom toilet is not easy to use, and it is not good to repair it once.In short, living in this hotel feels awkward, unsafe, uncomfortable.It feels noisy around."
0,酒店在路边，但是很多司机都不认识，可能是靠近云龙湖比较偏吧。酒点的单人间实在太小了，床的一边竟然靠在墙边，把窗帘都压住了，电视都要斜着才能看，11月份了中央空调还没有暖风！！！冷啊。,"The hotel is on the side of the road, but many drivers do not know it. It may be that it is more biased near Yunlong Lake.The single room of the wine is too small. The side of the bed is leaning against the wall and suppressing the curtains. The TV must be obliquely to watch. In November, the central air conditioner has not been warm!IntersectionIntersectionchilly."
0,房间有异味，入住时室外低于10度，但房间的中央调只有冷风！！！！室内设施陈旧！户外声音较嘈杂！只能在大堂看到服务员！总体非常不好！应该只能算是准二星！,"The room has a odor, and the outdoor is less than 10 degrees outdoors during the check -in, but the central tone of the room is only cold wind!IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionOld indoor facilities!Outdoor sounds are more noisy!You can only see the waiter in the lobby!The overall is very bad!It should only be regarded as a quasi -two -star!"
0,"我希望携程能多去找找性价比高的酒店,我是冲着四星去的,结果房间里是我想象不到脏乱差,首先进去一股很大的烟味象是前面入住的客人刚走没有来得及清洗,第二马桶的水下不去,淋浴的喷头及龙头是坏的,叫服务员换房间,前台却说你自己下来换,不知道整个邢台市还有有别的好酒店,我都服了,下次不去住了好在携程的服务还好,价格比前台问的便宜!","I hope that Ctrip can find more cost -effective hotels. I went to the four stars. As a result, I could not imagine that I could not imagine the mess. First of all, I went in a large smoke.I did n’t have time to clean it. I do n’t go underwater in the second toilet. The spray head and faucet of the shower are bad. The waiter changes the room, but the front desk said that you can change it yourself. I don’t know that there are other good hotels in Xingtai City.If you do, you will not live next time. Fortunately, Ctrip's service is okay. The price is cheaper than the front desk asks!"
0,如果不是因为他是4星不会入住，但入住后才知道上当了，房间很旧，只有高级房才能提供上网，早餐品种很少，服务员服务质量很差。,"If it wasn't because he would not move in because he was 4 stars, but he knew it was fooled after check -in. The room was very old. Only high -end rooms could provide access to the Internet. There were very few breakfast varieties and poor service quality."
0,本人5月3日入住。设施太陈旧，一股霉味，住店还收停车费，强烈不推荐。另外，协程给出的地址有误，是浔阳路，不是浔阳东路。,"I stayed on May 3.The facilities are too old, and a moldy smell is not recommended.In addition, the address given by the corporate is wrong. It is Puyang Road, not Puyang East Road."
0,"我们共5人,其中有外宾.一共住了2天前台的服务态度很冷淡,让人感觉很不好房间还是干净的但感觉对不起它4星的招牌同行中一人没有使用房间内的服务指南本,甚至没有打开过退房却被说在服务指南上留下了一道圆珠笔印子要求赔偿40元因为急赶飞机，申辩无效后就气愤的付钱走了这样的服务态度,真让人失望下次我应该不会再选择它了","We have 5 people, including foreign guests. The service attitude of the front desk for 2 days is very cold. It makes people feel that the room is still clean., I did n’t even open the check -out, but I was said to have left a round bead pen print on the service guide to ask for compensation for 40 yuan because I hurried the plane. After the defense was invalid, I paid for such a service attitude.I shouldn't choose it anymore"
0,1、车到酒店门口，没找到酒店，原来身边满是脚手架的大楼工地就是酒店，胆战心惊的走入，前台很破旧，很难想象是四星级的酒店。2、我住公寓套房，好像19楼，几部电梯只有一步到达，换了隔壁电梯才行，楼上走道昏暗，长长走廊，只有一两盏灯，，一出电梯眼睛要过一会儿才能看清东西，太省钱了吧。3、上午入住，电钻声不断，楼下房间原来在装修，携程也不事先告知，我晕！！！4、客厅较大，但太空了，只有沙发，却没有电视机，原来是叫人坐那里发呆的。5、洗澡没热水，一问，原来不是统一热水，而是电淋浴器，烧一桶要好长时间，一个晚上到第二天早上也没有热水出来，服务员说不知道为啥这样，四星级的无热水待遇，澡当然没洗，退房时心理和身上都发痒....6、口渴了烧水喝，电热水壶也坏的，打电话要换一个，说库房下班了，那是晚上八点多吧，从哪里变不出来一个？其他没人住的房间，你们经理的办公室...总能解决吧，不行烧一壶水上来也行啊，可他们就不理你，我只能跑到街上买水喝了！！7、所有家具设备都是陈旧的我想大家也会理解我的感受，我平时住店一般会先来看看众兄弟的网评，不好决不敢住。这次行程匆忙，是在路上电话预订的，酒店是携程反复向我推荐的，我才上了当，如果携程以后光注重经济效益而不注重酒店本身的品质，推荐这样的酒店，我看是要砸牌子的，毕竟你们也有竞争者的。补充点评2007年5月2日：再补充一点，宽带速度“奇快”，两个笔记本上网，一个酒店宽带，一个CDMA掌上宽带拨号上网，在联众打游戏，有线的网速还比不过无线的，还掉了几次线，送了人家好多分，呜呜...,"1.

All furniture and equipment are old. I think everyone will understand my feelings. I usually take a look at the online reviews of the brothers first. I never dare to live.This time the schedule was called on the road. The hotel was recommended to me repeatedly, and I would be fooled.

It is known as 5 stars, which is also a grade with the city celebrities in Nanjing. Compared with the Sufford Galaxy in Nanjing, the gap is not small. In addition, I pulled a mobile phone charger in the room when I left.I notify me in time, it seems that the hotel is not in the room when the guest checks out.

0,宾馆竟然不能提供网络调试服务，我做了一次兼职的网管，呵呵！很有面子，去得那天天气冷，刚开始有点不太适应，要空调遥控器，说现在不提供；要加被子，说没有，当时很郁闷，不过做了兼职网管之后很快就提供了这两样东西，很开心另外，前台太小，性价比不高补充点评2007年10月22日：顺便说一下，前台竟然不知道长途电话的收费标准,"The hotel could not provide network debugging services. I did a part -time network management, huh!Very face, the weather was cold that day, and it was a bit uncomfortable at first. It was necessary to air -conditioned remote control and said that it is not provided now. I need to add a quilt.The two things are very happy."
0,房间干净，但加床后无法动弹，设施有二星水平，在山上算不错了。房间只配二件羽绒服，加床小孩必须挨冻能力极强，前台无法商量，260元/天只是加床费用，不含羽绒服。餐厅绝对是五星的价格，二星的服务。,"The room is clean, but it cannot be moved after bed. The facilities have two -star level, which is good on the mountain.The room is equipped with only two down jackets. The child with bed must be extremely frozen. The front desk cannot be discussed. The cost of 260 yuan/day is only the cost of bed, without a down jacket.The restaurant is definitely the price of five -star, the service of the two -star."
0,酒店不承认此次预定，与携程交涉7、8次才解决！！补充点评2007年6月20日：明明入住了酒店！300多无窗房，勉强3星级别的标准，还不如住如加快捷,"The hotel does not recognize this reservation and negotiates with Ctrip 7 or 8 times before resolution!IntersectionSupplementary comment on June 20, 2007: Check in the hotel!There are more than 300 rooms, barely 3 -star standards, it is better to live as speeding up"
0,这里服务各方面不达五星级标准，早餐特别不好,"There are no five -star standards in all aspects here, and breakfast is particularly bad"
0,除了地点靠近地铁，几乎未发现其他优点。房间有异味，卫生间有污渍。最难以忍受的是电话和网络：电话机拿起来就是怪异的忙音，要连续拨打七八次才能接通一次，问到前台，答曰确实有这个接触不良的问题，没下文了，眼下之意您就忍着吧！当面告诉了前台，我要开通网络（虽然收费20元/天）。答曰：没问题，这就开通，自动分配IP地址，不需手动设置。可回房后发现连本地连接都没有，联系前台后，有了本地连接。但是试了半天也无法打开网页，再联系前台（已经快崩溃了！），十分钟后服务员过来，胡乱指点我删掉了公司的IP地址（只是备用设置，不是默认连接，根本没必要删），然后才将默认连接的自动获得IP改为了他们的手动地址。彻底晕倒，，，，，，，，以后再也不敢住这样的酒店了，也请携程对用户负责些！,"Except for the location close to the subway, no other advantages were found.The room has a odor and stains in the bathroom.The most unbearable is the telephone and the network: the phone is a weird busy sound. It must be dialed for seven or eight times to connect it once. Asked the front desk, answering the question of poor contact.You can bear it!I told the front desk in person, I want to open the network (although the charge is 20 yuan/day).Answer: No problem, then open it, automatically allocate the IP address without manual settings.But after returning to the room, I found that there was no local connection. After contacting the front desk, there was a local connection.However, after a long time, I couldn't open the webpage, and then contacted the front desk (it was almost collapsed!), And after ten minutes, the waiter came over and instructed me to delete the company's IP address (just setting settings, not the default connection, there is no need to delete it), Then the automatic IP of the IP of the default connection was changed to their manual address.Slowing fainting completely ,,,,,,,,, never dare to stay in such a hotel again, please also be responsible for Ctrip!"
0,大床房是有电脑可以上网的（但地毯很脏），还有自费的食品和日用品；标房比较干净，我在卫生间里２次看见有虫虫在爬，没有自费的食品和日用品，也没有电脑上网。大堂经理处理事情的能力极差！我们这批入住的人整体感觉都不满意，性价比实在太低！,"There is a computer to access the Internet (but the carpet is dirty), and there are food and daily necessities at their own expense; the standard room is relatively clean. I saw insects climbing in the bathroom 2 times.There is no computer online.The lobby manager's ability to deal with things is extremely poor!Our batch of people who stayed in the whole felt unsatisfactory, and the price / performance ratio was too low!"
0,一个字：差、差、差，态度差到极点。我们从7月22日住到7月27日，开了两间房，如果不是因为工作太忙，懒的换房间了，早就不能忍受了。第一天入住感觉不错，房间也还干净；随后后面几天，事情接着来了。一、就是我同事的衣服放房间里不见了（其他东西都在），问他们怎么回事，结果这个推那个，那个推这个，后来不了了之，最后还是没找到。二、我们房间没有靠枕，问服务员要一个，服务员说没有了，我就说去其他房间拿一个，服务员后来说领导没有批准，他们也不能动其他房间的，只能帮反应，后来也不了了之。三、床单、被套我们睡了四天了都不给我们换，后来还是我们主动提的，结果提后还只换了一张床的。四、最气愤就是这了，憋了几天的气终于爆发了。我们最后一天吃早饭，由于起的晚，我们就打算早餐、午餐一块吃（由于赶飞机），那个小餐厅老板很不错，说午饭没好，我就给你拿点剩余的早餐还有马上炒个菜，只收我们早餐卷就好，要我们问前台要餐卷，前台说不给，说早餐时间已过，我们就说，餐厅都愿意，你凭什么不给，后来我就火了，今天我就非要了。结果那个大厅经理（样子好象），既然给我拍桌子，最后没办法就说“给他，给他”。后来我问酒店餐厅老板，为什么他们服务态度那么差，怎么象国营的一样，小老板说“本来就是国营的”，在这看到吵架是常事，我说难怪，发誓再也来了。后来我还给携程客服部打电话，建议不要给客人推荐这样的酒店，简直受气。,"One word: difference, difference, difference, attitude is extremely different.We lived from July 22 to July 27 and opened two rooms. If it wasn't because of the work too busy and lazily changed the room, we couldn't stand it.The first day of check -in feels good, and the room is still clean; in the next few days, the incident came.First, it is my colleague's clothes and gone in the room (everything else is). Ask them what's going on. As a result, this push and that, that push this, but then it was not available, but I didn't find it in the end.2. There is no pillow in our room. Ask the waiter to ask for one. The waiter said that there is no more. I said that I went to other rooms to get one. The waiter later said that the leaders did not approve it, and they could not move other rooms. They could only help the response.Of.Third, the sheets and quilt we slept for four days. We did not change it for four days. Later, we took the initiative to mention it. As a result, we only changed a bed after mentioning.Fourth, the most angry is this, and the anger that took a few days finally broke out.We had breakfast on the last day. Because of the evening, we planned to eat breakfast and lunch (because of the plane). The small restaurant owner was very good. I said that lunch is not good, I will give you some remaining breakfast and immediately fry the remaining breakfast and immediately fry immediately.You just accept our breakfast rolls. We ask us to ask the front desk for meals. The front desk is not given. The breakfast time has passed. We say that the restaurant is willing. Why do you not give it?I have to do it today.As a result, the manager of that hall (as if it looked like), since he shot me a table, he couldn't say ""Give him, give him"" in the end.Later, I asked the hotel restaurant owner, why they have so poor service attitude and how they are like state -owned. The little boss said, ""It was originally a state -owned"". It is common to see a quarrel here. I said it was no wonder that they vowed again.Later, I also called the Ctrip customer service department. It is recommended that I don't recommend such a hotel to customers, which is almost angry."
0,"酒店交通极之不便,下午四时从新会汽车站等了两小时也等不到班车(是普通站着等的公车站哦),到最后打电话问酒店服务员,叫我们坐去崖南的公交车再打的去古兜,打的大概十五元,怎知一坐便坐了个半小时,去到崖南已入黑,那里根本是没有的士,班车也下班了,只好打电话到酒店叫他们帮忙叫车,他们说如包酒店车要100元,他帮我们叫的士要三十元,而且还要等十余分钟,去到酒店已八点半了,整个行程从珠海到古兜足足花了六个多小时,到了酒店房间比我想象中差,从携程订的豪华山景房,是我住过的最贵但是最差的房间,可能是暑假房间紧张关系吧,周围设施则一般,但我以后一定不会再去那里,奉劝各位除非是跟团或自驾游,否则一定不要去那里,交通车实在太不便了。","The hotel's traffic was extremely inconvenient. After waiting for two hours from Xinhui Bus Station at 4 pm, I couldn't wait for the bus (it is a bus station waiting for ordinary stations).The car went to Gu's pocket again, and it was about fifteen yuan. How can I sit and half an hour after sitting and go to the south of the Ya and enter the black.The hotel told them to help the car. They said that Ru Bao Hotel cost 100 yuan. He helped us call 30 yuan, and it took more than ten minutes. It was 8:30 to the hotel.It took more than six hours in Gu Dou. It was worse than I thought in the hotel room. The luxury mountain view room ordered from Ctrip is the most expensive but worst room I have lived. It may be the tension between the summer vacation room.The surrounding facilities are average, but I will not go there in the future. I advise you not to go there unless you travel with a group or self -driving tour."
0,"因为公司的报销制度严格,所以我在酒店结帐的时候让前台在打印出来的明细单上加盖酒店的章(大家说这个要求过分吗),但是前台小姐以各种理由拒不盖章,试问如果出差回去不能报销费用的话,这样的酒店谁还敢住?如果不是急着赶飞机的话,一定要找酒店要个说法!建议报销制度严格的朋友不要考虑这个酒店了.","Because the company’s reimbursement system is strict, I let the front desk stamped the hotel's chapter on the detailed list printed on the printed at the hotel (do you say this requirement is too much), but the lady at the front desk refuses to stamp for various reasons.If you can't reimburse the cost if you go back to the business trip, who dares to stay in such a hotel? If you are not in a hurry to catch the plane, you must find a hotel to say! It is recommended that friends with strict reimbursement systems do not consider this hotel."
0,"我只想说,以后我睡马路也不会住这里了.一进房间一股臭味.但飞机晚上12点才到北京,赶到酒店快1点了,也实在没办法,只好住下.由于我还没吃晚饭,问前台说是有24小时送餐,可是那个送餐电话是永远打不通的.另外,房间竟然没有宽带,告诉我如果要上网明早去商务中心.我晕啊.....都啥年代了啊.反正住进这个酒店就好像回到了80年代,一切都烂,位置还差,胡同里面车子不给进,我拖着大包小包自己走进去的!关键还脏!!!真是不知道携程为何要推荐这家酒店给我","I just want to say that in the future, I will not live here when I sleep. I have a smell when I enter the room. But the plane only arrived in Beijing at 12 pm. It was 1 o'clock to rush to the hotel. I had no choice but to stay.Since I haven't had dinner yet, I asked the front platform that there were 24 hours of delivery, but the meal delivery phone could never be connected. In addition, there was no broadband in the room.... It's all the age. Anyway, staying in this hotel is like returning to the 1980s, everything is bad, the location is still poor.!!! I really don’t know why Ctrip I want to recommend this hotel to me"
0,房间打扫的不干净（桌下竟然有一只脏袜子），设备比较旧，早餐太差，还有就是在洗澡时洗一半竟然没冷水，差点烫伤，总的来说比较差，以后不会再选择入住该家酒店,The room was cleaned clean (there was a dirty socks under the table). The equipment was old and the breakfast was too bad. There was no cold water during the bath.Check in the hotel
0,很遗憾在春节期间竟然在这里住了一晚．１．没有暖空调，总台和我们说是厦门只有４星以上才有暖空调，其实不然，有很多的经济型酒店都有，这是误导，速８就有还便宜．２．态度不好，也许是生意太好了，要求加棉被，说没有了，只有一条了，我们是两个房间．投诉携程后才给予解决，早干吗了？３．床单不太干净，上面竟然有一个脚印，要求换掉，换的时候发现床单下有很多的人的毛发，要求搞干净，服务员的回答是＂反正上面床单盖着，不要紧＂．晕４．房间够大，不过装修已经好多年了．,"Unfortunately, I lived here for a night during the Spring Festival.1.Without warm air conditioners, the main station told us that there is a warm air conditioner in Xiamen only 4 or more. In fact, there are many economically hotels. This is misleading, and the speed 8 is cheap.2.The attitude is not good, maybe the business is too good, asking the quilt, there is only one, there is only one, we are two rooms.Only after the complaint Ctrip was resolved, what did you do early?3.The sheets are not very clean. There is a footprint on it. It is required to be replaced. When changing, I find that there are many people's hair under the sheets. They are required to be clean. The waiter's answer is ""the bed sheets are covered on it anyway, it doesn't matter"".Halo 4.The room is big enough, but the decoration has been in the decoration for many years."

0,网上订了一间198的迷你温馨双床房，打开四楼第一间房，突入其来一股扑鼻的烟味，房间够迷你但是不温馨，致电服务台要求换房，让我们去五楼等服务员回来开门，等了20分钟没人来开，只好自己去总台拿钥匙。第二间还好没有烟味，但是房间旧旧的，还不如一般的三星宾馆。住了一晚上，电视是要扭着头看的，因为实在太小了，正面放不了桌子。结帐时居然说我们用了他们的抗菌毛巾和剃须刀，毛巾袋被撕开但是正面看是完好的，幸好我们住的是两位女性，用剃须刀干吗？折腾了一个多小时，从服务员到大夫，解释了半天我们没有碰过，终于免单。浪费我们不少时间，不知道这家酒店平时怎么管理和交班的。除了总台态度还不错以外，我再也不会住这么糟糕的地方了。电话预定时告诉我离春熙路10分钟走路，其实有足足两站路，坐公交车10分钟还差不多。,"A 198 mini -warm double bed was ordered on the Internet, opened the first room on the fourth floor, and broke into a nose. The room was mini but not warm.When the waiter came back to open the door, after waiting for 20 minutes, no one came to open, so he had to go to the main station to get the key.The second room is okay, but the old room is not as good as the ordinary Samsung Hotel.After staying for one night, the TV had to twist his head, because it was too small to put the table on the front.At the checkout, we said that we used their antibacterial towels and shaver. The towel bag was torn apart but the front was intact. Fortunately, we lived in two women. Why do we use shaver?After tossing for more than an hour, from the waiter to the doctor, we explained that we hadn't touched it for a long time, and finally exempt.We waste a lot of time, I don't know how this hotel usually manages and hand over shifts.Except for the good attitude of the main station, I will never live in such a bad place again.Tell me to walk 10 minutes away from Chunxi Road when the phone is scheduled. In fact, there are two stations, and the bus is almost the same for 10 minutes."

0,我们是在5月2日入住的此酒店，首先外观有点旧，酒店门口的名字是金山大酒店不是叫做新金山，令我们有点混扰。酒店大堂算大，但是设施比较旧。我们订的是行政客房，走进浴室内，首先发现地板有很多毛发，而且很黑，好像完全没有清洁过的一样。房间地毯也像好久没有清洗过，好多污渍。房间的空调不制冷，向服务员讲过，但是没有人来处理，搞到晚上没能睡个好觉。不过，酒店的床还是可以赞一赞的，算是软硬适中。下次去杭州的话，不会考虑住这了。,"We stayed in this hotel on May 2nd. First of all, the appearance was a bit old. The name of the hotel's door was Jinshan Hotel, which was not called Xinkinshan, which made us a little mixed.The hotel lobby is big, but the facilities are relatively old.We booked an administrative room. When we walked into the bathroom, we first found that there were many hair on the floor, and it was very dark, as if it had never been cleaned at all.The carpet in the room has not been cleaned for a long time, and there are many stains.The air conditioner in the room is not refrigerated and told the waiter, but no one came to deal with it, and I couldn't sleep at night.However, the hotel's bed can still be praised, which is moderate soft and hard.The next time I go to Hangzhou, I will not consider living."
0,装修的味道太重，商务标准间的房间太小。旺季的原因吧，我结帐的时候听到当天的房价又提价了，坐地起价，没办法。,"The decoration taste is too heavy, and the room in the business standard room is too small.The reason for the peak season. When I checked the checkout, I heard the price of the house on the same day."
0,非常差，服务差。房间比较大，但也很差，更重要的是临近铁路，很吵！难怪酒店生意不好，人很少！,"Very bad and poor service.The room is relatively large, but it is also very poor. More importantly, the railway is near the railway, very noisy!No wonder the hotel has a bad business and few people!"
0,第一次住这里，之前有同事住过，所以觉得应该还可以，没想到：1、门童非常不主动，门口站着几个门童和保安聊天，不理客人，要我自己站到大马路上去拦车，可恶的是，我拦到车之后，门童居然从门口跑过来说是帮前面客户拦的车，眼睁睁看着他把车引到一个老外面前，我快气疯了；2、游泳池一般，但是旁边的按摩池看着就很脏，不能用的，更衣室那个脏。。。3、送餐可供选择非常少，第二天清洁客房的时候，用过的餐具居然不收走；4、上网很慢，而且我房间的网线坏了，叫了n久才有人来换；5、我住的房间靠街的背面，本来应该是安静的地方，偏巧后面是个大工地，半夜不休，晚上两点多还有打桩机在勤奋工作，酒店几乎没有隔音，那叫一个吵啊，两个晚上都是捂着耳朵睡的；6、半夜十一点半的时候，突然有服务员按门铃，赶紧套上衣服去开门，结果说按错了。。。。。。。。。疯了；7、说到最可恶的地方了，我checkout的时候忘了一个发箍和一个包装好的熏香炉，因为赶飞机，所以打电话说好过几天回去取，第二周我同事帮我去拿，说发箍和橙子放在一起，被弄坏了？？？（听着就很恶心）那熏香炉呢？酒店跟我同事说会主动跟我联系，至今几个礼拜过去了，没有人找过我！这是什么酒店啊！每次住酒店总有些满意不满意的地方，但是深航这次实在是恶心到我了，不吐不快。仔细回想起来，基本是无一是处的酒店，大家千万不要住，这个价格也不算便宜，我在深圳住过比这性价比高的酒店多的是，而且携程的价格也不便宜，后来听人说很多单位都有协议价格，想想很不划算。宾馆反馈2008年4月29日：尊敬的客户：您好！非常感谢您在入住期间对酒店服务不周道的地方及时提出了诚恳的批评和指正，对部分员工的工作处事不当给您带来的入住不便和身心不悦，酒店深表歉意。酒店领导在第一时间获悉您的意见后，对当事人进行了批评和教育。酒店诚意邀请您能在下次来深期间再次光临本酒店，给我们以当面致歉的机会，同时酒店也希望通过自身的不断努力，能够得到您的再次认可。,"I lived here for the first time, I have lived in my colleagues before, so I think it should be okay.

0,本人在２月９日和２月１０日两天通过携程预定了三亚的寰岛海底世界酒店，通过这次的预定，终于开了眼界，领略到了三亚酒店啃人的高招．本来４００元的房间我预定要１９８０元一个晚上，９日从海口开了快四个钟的车在下午三点半到酒店，办好入住手续上到房间快四点，结果房间还没收拾好，足足等了将近一个钟才可以进房间休息，进到房间更呆住了，之前预定时看网上的点评全都写得不错，我看都是这个酒店找人上去写的用来骗人的，１９８０远一晚的房间居然跟民宿没两样，厕所是黑的，还有臭味，被单是黄的，这个也算了，新年嘛．第二天早上我们就准时到中餐厅打算享用我们花了９０元（每人３０元）的中式早餐．结果再次呆住，想知道我们的早餐的内容吗？一小锅白粥，一小碟没味道的榨菜，三个馒头三个菜肉包三个芝麻球，就这样，结果我们一口都没吃就走了，相信这个黑店会把这些早餐收起来留给下一位客人用吧．两天过去了，我们要退房了，最气人的事情也来了，结帐时硬实污了我们二十块，说我们其中一个房间用了两包清洁液，事实我们根本没用，我想就算了反正二十块，出门在外肯定要忍声吞气的，议论争辨后在我们正打算付钱的时候，走来一个身穿黄色衣服，面目可憎的臭女人，说我们吃了退房，要加收４００元，（这个酒店不是假期的时候也只是４００元一晚），我实在太气了，知道根本争不过她们，我想中国现在是个文明社会，应该会投诉有门吧，结果我还是失望了，先打到海南省的旅游投诉电话，对方询问一轮后告诉我们这不是他们的管辖范围，要我打到三亚的投诉的电话，（我真不晓得这群领纳税人的钱过日子的烂人的职责是什么），我又再打到三亚，足足打了快半个钟才打得通，我又再重复一次刚才的话，对方说马上派人来了解处理，挂断后，心理想这个假期总不算太坏，还有人为我们主持公道，结果又是我们想得美，等了足足两个钟一个人都没到过（这期间我们不断打电话，就再也打不通，可能是故意让电话不通吧），结果我们还是付了那４００块才可以离开酒店，离开是已经是下午三点多了，大家都还没吃饭．这就是我在三亚这个全国闻名的旅游胜地得到的待遇，竞请各位想要入住这个烂酒店的游客务必先阅读我这篇住后感再做决定，免得象我们一样本来好好的假期白白被糟蹋了宾馆反馈2008年3月11日：您好!您在春节期间的入住不尽人意，向您表达歉意!其次，有需要说明的几点：1、房间的被单有白色和淡黄色二种；洗手间内除大理石台面是黑色的之外，其他都是白色的。洗手间有自费品“浴之伴”洗液，配有非常明显的提示--“有偿使用10元/袋”。2、您说“还是付了那400块才可以离开酒店”，事实上您在2月11日中午12：18分退房，酒店方没有收您的半日租，如果要收半日租，那也应该是全日租1960元的一半即980元。酒店方非常重视客人的意见，也对提出意见的客人表示感谢!真诚地希望每一位客人都能够对我们提出宝贵的意见反馈，以帮助我们改进和提升服务质量。,"I booked Sanya's Underwater World Hotel through Ctrip on February 9th and February 10th. Through this reservation, I finally opened their horizons and appreciated the high tricks of Sanya Hotel.Originally 400 yuan of rooms I scheduled to be 1980 yuan a night. On the 9th, I drove a car from Haikou for almost four minutes to the hotel at 3:30 in the afternoon.After waiting for nearly an hour before you can enter the room to rest, enter the room even more, and the reviews on the Internet are all written well before. I think this hotel is all written by the hotel to cheat people.The room in 1980 was the same as the homestay. The toilet was black and smelly. It was yellow alone. This is also the case.The next morning we went to the Chinese restaurant to enjoy the Chinese breakfast of 90 yuan (30 yuan per person) on time.As a result, I stayed again, do you want to know the content of our breakfast?A small pot of white porridge, a small plate of flavorless mustard, three steamed buns, three vegetables, three sesame balls, and three sesame balls. In this way, we left without eating.Use the next guest.Two days have passed, we are going to check out, and the most irritating thing has come. At the checkout, we stained our twenty yuan hard and said that one of our rooms used two packs of cleaning solution. In fact, we are useless.Even if you think about twenty yuan anyway, you must have tolerate the voices when you go out. After the discussion, when we are intending to pay, we will walk with a yellow -clothes stinky woman wearing yellow clothes and abominable.The room should be charged 400 yuan. (This hotel is not only 400 yuan a night during the holidays). I am too angry and know that they can't fight them at all. I think China is now a civilized society and should complain to have a door.As a result, I was still disappointed. First, I went to the travel complaint phone number in Hainan Province. After asking the other party, the other party told us that this was not their jurisdiction. I asked me to call Sanya's complaints. (I really don’t know this group of taxpayersWhat is the responsibility of the bad people who live the money?), I hit Sanya again, and it took half an hour to get through. I repeated it again.After the break, the psychology thought that this holiday was not too bad, and there were people who presidered us to justice.If you can't make any time, you may be deliberately letting the phone pass). As a result, we still paid the 400 yuan to leave the hotel. It was already more than three o'clock in the afternoon, and everyone hadn't eaten yet.This is the treatment I got in Sanya, a well -known tourist destination in the country, and visitors who want to stay in this rotten hotel must read my decision after living.The hotel feedback on March 11, 2008: Hello! Your check -in during the Spring Festival is unsatisfactory and apologize to you! Second, there are some points that need to be explained: 1. There are two types of rooms in the room.Except for the black table in the toilet, the others are white.The toilet has its own ""bath companion"" washing solution, equipped with very obvious prompts- ""paid 10 yuan/bag"".2. You said, ""I still pay the 400 yuan before I can leave the hotel."" In fact, you check out at 12:18 noon on February 11th.It should be half a day rented 1960 yuan, which is 980 yuan.The hotel party attaches great importance to the opinions of the guests, and also thanks to the guests who put forward the opinions! Sincerely hoping that every guest can provide valuable feedback on us to help us improve and improve the quality of service."
0,每次中途休息都会住在这，不是因为这家酒店有多好，主要是上下高速比较方便。房间一般，餐厅饭菜比较差。,"Every time you rest, you will live here, not because of how good this hotel is, it is mainly convenient to go up and down at high speed.The room is average, and the restaurant's meals are poor."
0,很破的宾馆和招待所差不多，服务也有问题多找钱还给她连声谢谢都不说气死我拉，早饭跟本不是人吃的，房间送餐送完了就没人来拿餐具了晕倒，点了一个红烧牛肉牛肉上都是淋巴都不敢吃而且要48元一份。只有网速很快能到2M，不过建议不要入住太差拉。,"The very broken hotel is almost the same as the guest house, and there are more service questions to find more money and give her even thank you. I do n’t say that I ’m not eating.A braised beef and beef dare not eat lymphatic and it takes 48 yuan a copy.Only the Internet speed can reach 2M soon, but it is recommended not to stay too much."

0,住店后真实感受：根本没法睡觉，房间的隔音太差了，是我住过的隔音最差的酒店，隔壁2个人正常的对话我都能听得特别清楚，2个房间里的衣柜位置根本没有墙，就是衣柜的背板隔开的，早上服务员居然在我房间门口打手机，电话不听的响，听得特别清楚，总之，你跟本没法睡觉。,"True feelings after living in the shop: I can't sleep at all, the sound insulation in the room is too bad. It is the most sound insulation hotel I have lived. I can hear it very clearly about the normal dialogue next door.There is no wall at all, that is, the backboard of the wardrobe is separated. In the morning, the waiter actually called the phone at the door of my room. The phone didn't listen, and it was particularly clear. In short, you couldn't sleep with it."

0,这种酒店如果也算3星级酒店的话，我真的无话可说了。从入住开始就不舒服：因为没定到4星级的酒店，所以携程建议住这里，说是3星的，还可以。晚上12点多到的，checkin时，服务员登记完也不问你刷卡还是付现金，直接告诉你，交500压金，我说我就200元现金，刷卡行不？checkin完了，就看不到服务员了，自己找电梯。电梯是迷你型的，瞠死能站4个人就不能动弹了。房间一股难闻的怪味，闻着就反胃。桌子上不知道多久没擦过，用手摸了一下，漆黑的，那卫生纸擦了好几遍，凑合着先上网吧邮件发了。卫生间的门是破的，门框上全是大破洞，像是炮弹炸过的，房间没有暖气，半夜被冻醒了，找不到被子可以加的，只好把衣服压在身上，这才感觉身上不冷了。早餐加上小菜一起，不超过10样，不知道吃什么，没有水果，吃了碗稀饭就算了。checkout时，服务员打电话到楼层让查房，1分钟后，服务员气凶凶的跟我说，你有没有拿黄页，要赔偿的。晕！！！什么黄页呀。问了半天，说是一本放在抽屉里的什么书不见了。靠，那么脏的桌子，抽屉我连碰都没碰，卫生间我连毛巾都没敢用，拿你什么破书干什么。你放没有放，或者是你放在别的地方了，自己找去。MD，什么破地方呀。折腾半天，还不让我走。最后我也不知道他们是找到了还是没找到，或者是他们发现自己根本就没放什么黄页，没有任何人向我解释，也没有人给我道歉，可是总算是可以让我走了，还不主动给我发票。要求打印后，给我出了份收据。好在4星级的景德镇大酒店的房间已经出来了，可以住进去了。赶紧离开这个是非之地吧。后来想想，前台打电话上去，然后1分钟左右楼上就打电话下来说不见了书，这么快的速度，好像早就知道少了什么似的，让人不能不怀疑其目的性了。,"If such a hotel is also counted as a 3 -star hotel, I really have nothing to say.From the beginning of staying, I was uncomfortable: because it was not set to a 4 -star hotel, Ctrip suggested staying here and said that it was 3 stars, and it was okay.When it arrived at 12 o'clock in the evening, when checking, the waiter would not ask you to swipe the card or pay cash after registration, and tell you that paying 500 deposits. I said that I would be 200 yuan in cash. Can you swipe the card?After checkin, you can't see the waiter, find the elevator by yourself.The elevator is a mini -type, and 4 people who stagnate the dead can not move.A unpleasant smell in the room, nausea when he smelled.I do n’t know how long I have n’t wiped it on the table. I touched it with my hands. It was dark. The toilet paper was rubbed several times, and it was sent to the Internet cafe email first.The door of the bathroom is broken, and the door frame is full of large holes, like the shell bombed, the room has no heating, and it is frozen in the middle of the night.Not cold.Breakfast plus small dishes together, no more than 10, I do n’t know what to eat, there is no fruit, it ’s okay to eat a bowl of porridge.When checkout, the waiter called to the floor for the inspection. After 1 minute, the waiter told me fiercely, do you have a yellow pages and compensate.faint!IntersectionIntersectionWhat yellow pages.After asking for a long time, I said it was a book in the drawer.Damn, I did n’t even touch the dirty table, the drawer, and I did n’t even dare to use the towel in the bathroom.You do n’t put it, or you put it elsewhere and find it yourself.MD, what breaking the place.Tosses for a long time and don't let me go.In the end, I don't know if they found it or found, or they found that they didn't put any yellow pages at all.Take the initiative to invoice.After the printing was required, I gave me a receipt.Fortunately, the room of the 4 -star Jingdezhen Hotel has come out and can live in.Hurry up and leave this right and wrong place.Later, I thought about it, and the front desk called up, and then called upstairs about 1 minute to say that the book was gone. At such a fast speed, it seemed to have known what was missing, so that people must doubt their purpose."
0,我是早上近6点才到的，说是要算一天的房费。我说没问题酒店大都是这样的。第三天因为火车要晚上9点多才开，所以我延了半天到六点退房，结果到5点40就打电话催我说要来查房了，我说还没到6点你们催什么啊，而且我那天早上是6点到的，你再给我延半个小时或一个小时都是份内的事，赶客人赶什么一样的。以后不去了。,"I only arrived at nearly 6 in the morning, saying that it would count the one -day room fee.I said that there is no problem in hotels.On the third day, because the train was only driven at 9 o'clock in the evening, I was extended for a long time to 6 o'clock. As a result, I called me to urge me to come to the inspection. I said what you urged at 6 o'clockAh, and I arrived at 6 o'clock that morning. You gave me half an hour or an hour.I won't go in the future."
0,这是第三次入住森桦苑了，由于在9/17的定单（两个大床间）上酒店估计是超卖了，入住时被告知没有接到携程的定单，只好以178/间，入住2个务大床房。1、酒店以推委责任的方式来处理此事，让我对于森桦苑完全失去信心！，其实就算承认卖超，我也可以接受的，就算是要加钱。2、浴室的清洁情况实在让人不敢恭维！大家入住公寓酒店图的是价廉、要求的是方便、干净和舒适，在清洁上出问题，让我确定了未来将森桦苑完全排除在考虑范围之外。3、估计是生意太好！所以出现了这些状况！那么！建议大家让它生意淡一阵子，也许有助于酒店自行调整一下吧，相信对于酒店或者我们这些客户都不是坏事！,"This is the third time I stayed in Senhuayuan. Because the hotel was oversold in the order in the 9/17 (two large beds), I was told that I did not receive the order from Ctrip at the time of check -in.Check in two large bed rooms.1. The hotel handles the matter in a promotional responsibility, so that I have lost confidence in Sen Huayuan!In fact, even if it is admitted to selling super, I can accept it, even if you want to add money.2. The cleaning of the bathroom is really uninvited!Everyone stays in the apartment hotel. It is cheap, convenient, clean, and comfortable. If the problem is cleaned, I will determine that in the future, I will completely exclude Senhua Garden outside the scope of consideration.3. It is estimated that the business is too good!So these situations appear!So!It is recommended that everyone let it have a short period of time, maybe it will help the hotel to adjust itself. I believe that it is not a bad thing for hotels or our customers!"
0,我不知道这里的早餐餐具到底是否消毒，我看到服务生直接就拿收下来的餐具在水龙头上手洗以后又放回到了盘中供客人取用。想想真恶心,I don't know if the breakfast tableware here disinfected. I saw that the waiter took the tableware directly and washed it on the faucet and then put it back to the disk for guests to use it.Think about it

0,没有见过这么小的房间两人在房间走动的话需要让来让去的，酒店服务员态度都是冷冰冰的从来没见过他们笑过或主动和你打招呼，离地铁东涌线距离还可以。酒店周围环境不怎么样都是居民区（当然不是有钱人住的）下次去的话坚决不会再住这家了也不推荐,"If you have n’t seen such a small room, you need to let it go if you walk in the room. The hotel waiter has a cold attitude that he has never seen them laughing or greeted you with the initiative.The environment around the hotel is not very good, all of which are residential areas (of course, not rich people live), if you go to the next time, you will never live in this house and it is not recommended.

0,卫生条件比较差，真的很差！毛巾白里透着黑，马桶和地面已经分家，一碰就要倒。没有停车场，车放在马路边不是太安全,"The sanitary conditions are poor and really bad!The towel is white in white, the toilet and the ground are already separated, and it will fall.There is no parking lot, it is not too safe to put the car on the side of the road"

0,酒店太老旧了。走在地板上都有震动的感觉。厕所内的手纸就一点点。220的价格还不包早餐。最可气的是刷卡的话还要收2%的手续费，这也就算了。结帐的时候，服务员竟然说房费加手续费是224.4元，收你225元。我就觉得奇怪了，就算是四舍五入也不应该进位的。再说我们是刷卡消费，就算是1分钱我们也可以付的。在我们的争辩下她才说那好吧收你224.4元。太过分，随随便便就加收钱。对庐山宾馆的印象差差差。建议大家还是选择其他宾馆。反正上面有很多宾馆。价格比这个便宜的也多的是。,"The hotel is too old.Walking on the floor has a vibration feeling.The hand paper in the toilet is a little bit.The price of 220 does not include breakfast.The most annoying thing is to charge a 2%handling fee if you swipe your card, which is even if it is.At the checkout, the waiter even said that the house fee was 224.4 yuan, and you received 225 yuan.I feel strange, even if the four houses have entered, it should not be in place.Besides, we can pay for cards, and we can pay even for 1 point.Under our debate, she said that it was okay to collect you 224.4 yuan.Too too much, just collect money casually.The impression of Lushan Hotel is poor.It is recommended that you choose other hotels.There are many hotels on it anyway.The price is more cheaper than this."

0,该酒店实际是兰州铁路局的内部招待所，位于火车站出站口处，如果不怕火车吵，那么晚上可以睡得着。价格不算便宜，只能是一般。房间很旧，房内设备一般，卫生排气扇坏了，抽水马桶也坏了，维修人员脾气很暴，要很有礼貌的对待。前台服务人员素质比较差，早上退房时前台竟然找不到服务员，等了近半个小时，耽误宝贵的时间。入住酒店停车竟然要收费。建议不要将该酒店做为入住选择，除非你对火车有特殊的感情。,"The hotel is actually an internal guest house of the Lanzhou Railway Bureau.

0,前台小姐的态度不好，房间一开门走进去，一股发霉的味道，而且阳台的门的玻璃是坏的，cheakout的时候前台还让我们赔钱，说我们把门弄坏了。前台小姐兴冲冲的跑上来说隔壁的客人投诉我们太吵，要我们做房客登记，态度差的一塌糊涂，隔壁是客人，难道我们不是客人吗？而且我们一开门，隔壁比我们吵多了。反正就是一个字：差！,"The lady of the front desk is not good. As soon as the room opens the door, a moldy taste, and the glass of the door of the balcony is bad. When cheakout, the front desk also let us lose money, saying that we broke the door.The front desk lady ran up and said that the guests next door complained that we were too noisy.

0,出于对海航系统的好感，虽条件并不出众，早餐简陋，（同等价格可以选择宝华大酒店、康年皇冠大酒店等很多条件更好的酒店）但仍第二次入住，提前预订同样房型（豪华商务大床房），价格也一样；但入住时（较晚到酒店），房型并不一样（更简陋一些）。电话与前台交涉，称这些都算是豪华商务大床房，价格也一样。（不懂酒店如何自定义）要求与上次入住同样房型，告知已无房，遭拒。晕……另：携程预订此酒店房间价格偏贵，直接入住前台谈价只要340元，而携程价却要378元。不知携程如何确保网上公布的价格如所宣传的那样，是最实惠的价格？下次，应该不会再选择这儿了。,"Out of the favor of the HNA system, although the conditions are not outstanding and the breakfast is simple, (the same price can choose many hotels with better conditions such as Baohua Hotel, Kangnian Crown Hotel), but still staying for the second time.The room type (luxury business large bed room), the price is the same; but at the time of check -in (late to the hotel), the room type is not the same (more rude).The phone negotiated with the front desk, saying that these are all luxury business beds, and the price is the same.(I don't understand how the hotel is customized.)

In addition: Ctrip booking this hotel room is expensive, and it is only 340 yuan to check in at the front desk directly, while the Ctrip price costs 378 yuan.I wonder how to ensure that the price announced on the Internet is the most affordable price as promoted?Next time, you should not choose here anymore."
0,很普通的一间酒店，应该说不值这个价格。酒店老，房间小，早餐差。周围正在修路，乱得一塌糊涂。想找个好一点儿的饭店，很难！在酒店吃了一顿饭，居然连正规的餐牌都没有，蹊跷！不过服务还是不错的，这也是唯一值得称道的地方！,"A very ordinary hotel, it should be said that it is not worth the price.The hotel is old, the room is small, and the breakfast is poor.The road is around, and it is messy.It's difficult to find a better restaurant!After eating a meal in the hotel, I didn't even have a regular menu, I was strange!However, the service is still good, this is also the only place to be commendable!"

0,这是我通过携程所预定的最差的酒店。首先是走廊地毯很脏，进房后表面还可以，但质量很差：房间没有网线，电话两次打到服务台后，来了一个服务员，送来了一根网线后就走了，结果不好用，后又打电话，一个男服务员来后查了又查，最后确定房间的进线有问题，再要求下，换了一个房间，这个房间网络倒是好用，后又发现这个房间的热水器是坏的，打电话三次服务员才给换了一个。房间内两小袋茶叶是收费的，饮用水是收费的，没有不另收费的东西。什么都想收费。强烈建议携程取消此酒店在携程的预定，以便再害他人。,"This is the worst hotel I booked through Ctrip.The first is that the corridor carpet is very dirty, and the surface is okay after entering the room, but the quality is very poor: After the room has no network cable, after the phone calls to the service desk twice, a waiter came and sent a network cable and left. The result is notIt ’s easy to use, then called again. After a male waiter came, checked and checked, and finally determined that there was a problem with the line in the room.

The carpet in the room is relatively dirty, the speed of the network is very slow, and the operation of the TV is very inhuman.The floor drain of the shower is very slow, and if you are not carefulThe price of massage and foot therapy in the hotel is to let you go again and again, and will always encourage you to increase the consumer project!IntersectionThere are also advantages, that is, girls at the front desk check-in are really beautiful, haha."
0,这几乎是江阴最好的酒店了，有很多老外都住在这里。房间的大小还可以，装饰和设施感觉没有五星的标准，算四星还差不多。最让人受不了的是这家的停车场，我是在一个普通的日子去的，结果还是碰上有人在宾馆结婚。地下地上都停满了赴婚宴人的车，结果我们住店的人要把车停在马路对面的很远的地方。那天还下着中雨，我车上有一个法国人、一个菲律宾人和两个中国人不得不提着行李冒着雨躲过一个又一个的水坑去宾馆大厅。门口的保安好像对这种情况已经见怪不怪了，看着我们四个人在于里跳来跳去面无表情。真是烂透了。,"This is almost the best hotel in Jiangyin, and many foreigners live here.The size of the room is okay.

0,我是一周前预订的，但到酒店后，却被告知没有收到携程的通知，所有人在交涉了整个晚上后最终我们自己解决了住宿问题，我觉得是因为当时去的人比较多，这家酒店就在死赖不给我们房间，以便他们自己卖得太贵。整个过程携程的服务也特别慢。这个酒店的房间也很差。,"I booked a week ago, but after arriving at the hotel, I was informed that I did not receive the notice from Ctrip. After the negotiations were negotiated, we finally solved the problem of accommodation by ourselves. I think it was because there were more people going at the time.The hotel is not giving us a room, so that they can sell them too expensive.The entire process of Ctrip is also particularly slow.The room of this hotel is also poor."

0,我们一家厦门四日游的最后一天就是选择了这家酒店，简直后悔死了。先说交通，酒店有自己的码头，不过一小时只有一班船，错过就得苦等。而且码头也很简陋，我们一家有老有小，每次上下船都得小心翼翼。再说环境，我们订的是豪华房，跑进去一看：里面的设施陈旧，衣柜的门很难关上，地板没扫干净。最要命的是空调只能制冷，浴室没有浴霸。大冬天的，岛上还比市区要低1－2度。打开水龙头，水是黄的，热水也很小，不要说洗澡，洗个脸都勉强。拉开窗帘，外面是一片工地！住在酒店里，心比天气还要冷...喜欢清静的人大概会喜欢这里，因为除了总台有2个人，其他工作人员基本难得一见，所以要什么都得自己想办法。本来想打个市话，结果告诉我开通市话要10元／天，晕！我就打个问讯电话，还是用手机吧！,"The last day of our Xiamen four -day tour was chose this hotel, and I regretted death.Let's talk about traffic first. The hotel has its own pier, but there is only one group of ships in an hour. If you miss it, you have to suffer.And the pier is also very simple. Our family is old and small, and we have to be careful every time I get on and off.Besides the environment, we ordered a luxurious room. Run in and take a look: the facilities inside are old, the door of the wardrobe is difficult to close, and the floor is not cleaned.The most terrible thing is that the air conditioner can only cool down, and the bathroom has no bath.In the winter, the island is 1-2 degrees lower than the urban area.Open the faucet, the water is yellow, and the hot water is also very small. Don't say a bath, wash your face barely.Open the curtains, there is a construction site outside!Living in the hotel, the heart is colder than the weather ... Those who like quiet will probably like it here, because there are two people except the main station, other staff members are basically rare, so they have to find ways to find everything.I wanted to call a market, but I told me that the opening of the market for 10 yuan / day, dizzy!I just call a phone call, let's use the mobile phone!"

0,我是通过携程预订的巨川假日酒店，2008年3月17号晚上入住（因为第二天要见客户），我不是经常去塘沽出差，这是第二次，第一次和老总住的是巨川国际商务酒店还可以就不多说了，这次我带一个同事去，住的是巨川假日，下面就说说我的遭遇吧:晚上一到酒店大概9点多，前台手续办得很利索，可是我到了屋里401（同事住402情况差不多），打开房门一股让人想吐的味道扑面而来，我打电话找来服务员，说是空气清新剂的味道，可我从没闻到过这种类似烂红薯、腐烂、发霉味道的空气清新剂，天还很冷，无奈我打开窗户，味道久久不能散去，我只好整晚开着窗户，可是我太冷了就打开中央空调，可是这空调好像一个拖拉机在你耳边轰鸣。我彻底晕菜了，房子挨着马路，也不隔音整晚能听到过大型车的声音，与其这么臭噪音这么大，我为什么不直接睡在马路上呢？于是整晚我都在问自己这个愚蠢的问题，一直到天亮补充一点:卫生间提供的毛巾硬的可以当脚垫用唯一令人欣慰的是我找服务台投诉时，接电话的态度很不错，反复的说屋里都是这个味道我们也没办法，提示我开窗通风。既然别的屋也这么臭，我内心多少平衡一些，不过我下次绝对不会再来了发表上诉评论决不是我恶意污蔑，实属个人亲身经历，我是一名销售，经常各处跑，自认为对环境的要求不高，只要卫生干净方便就好，这里我要奉劝来塘沽出差办事的朋友千万不要住巨川假日。,"I am the Juchuan Holiday Hotel booked through Ctrip. I stayed in the evening of March 17, 2008 (because I saw the customer the next day). I did not go to Tanggu often. This is the second time.You can not say much about Juchuan International Business Hotel. This time I took a colleague and lived in Juchuan Holiday. Let ’s talk about my encounter.Very sharp, but I arrived at 401 in the house (the situation of living in 402 was almost the same), and opened the door of the door to make people want to vomit. I called the waiter and said it was the taste of fresh air.I haven't smelled this kind of air fresh agent similar to rotten sweet potato, rotten, and moldy taste. The sky is still cold. I helplessly open the window and the taste cannot be dispersed for a long time. I had to open the window all night, but I opened it when I was too cold.The central air conditioner, but this air conditioner seems to be a tractor roaring in your ear.I was completely faint. The house was next to the road, and I could hear the sound of large cars all night without sound separation. Instead of so stinky noise, why didn't I sleep directly on the road?So all night I was asking myself this stupid question, until dawn to add some: the towels provided by the bathroom can be hard. When the only gratifying foot pad is to use the only thing I am looking for a service desk, the attitude of answering the phone is very good.Repeatedly, we have no way in the house, reminding me to open the window to ventilate.Since other houses are so stinky, I am more balanced, but next time I will never come again to publish an appeal comments, it is not my malicious slander. It is a personal experience. I am a sales.I think the requirements for the environment are not high. As long as it is clean and convenient, I have to advise friends who come to Tanggu to do business."

0,住过的最差的之一１．房间极其闷，在高原本来就缺氧，闷在房间里极易加剧高原反应；２．简陋。窗上的床垫歪了，露出木头的床架；３．洗手间比几十块的招待所更脏，马桶盖子是用铁丝连在一起的，冲水装置需要提起来才能用；４．部分服务员态度恶劣。退房的时候我背了巨大的包，问服务员能不能稍微快点，被白了几眼。总之，如果不怕死，可以来住。,"One of the worst living 1.The room is extremely stuffy, and the altitude is already hypoxic.Minimal.The mattress on the window is crooked, and the wooden shelf exposes the wood;The toilet is dirty than tens of dollars.

0,去贵州省委办事情，由于不是很熟悉贵阳，通过携程在贵阳定了间武岳酒店房。我在5月11日住进武岳酒店5月26日离开。该酒店给我的感觉，就是房间太旧了，服务太差了，和我以前住过的4星酒店比差太多了，根本不能算是4星，不知道怎么评的。酒店的房间太小，早餐太差（有一天的早餐，绿豆粥竟然是酸的，一开始以为是贵州特色，后来多吃了几口发现绝对是食物变质了）。郁闷！！！每天晚上本来是要发报纸的，我住在该酒店的16天中竟然只发了6天！！最重要的是在携程上的酒店图片和实际中武岳酒店的外观和客房图片完全不同，而且差的太多了，太太太差！！！不知道携程是怎么调查的。武岳酒店的服务更是恶劣！！结帐的时候，非说我给他们的一个压缩毛巾用了，跟他们浪费了一个多小时，结果是不了了之，一句话没有服务意识和品质！！！！我住了16天花了4800元，怎么能拿你一个10元钱的东西呢？？而且是压缩毛巾这样没用的东西（他们天天换浴巾）我现在也没想清楚！！！从贵阳离开后我到了西安，没用携程，实在是携程上面的东西太难让人相信了！！！诚信是一个民族最宝贵的财富，为什么我们现在把这么宝贵的财富统统抛离了呢？？？我们最后还剩下些什么？？,"I went to the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee to work.

0,因为来不及上网查，只好电话定，结果携程拼命向我推荐。结果：标准大床房奇小，只有12平米，我住的530窗外就是一个平台，安全性非常不好；毛巾非常旧，又黑又硬，是我见过最差的；早餐还好，品种还有几个；大堂还行，总台的服务还有4星。宾馆反馈2008年5月5日：,"Because it was too late to check the Internet, I had to make a phone call, but Ctrip desperately recommended it to me.Results: The standard large bed room is small, only 12 square meters. The 530 window I live in is a platform.

0,我通过携程预定住的是400元一天的单人间大床房。性价比很差银川有香渔和柏悦好像看起来都不错为什么携程没有？？1：酒店设施过于陈旧。地毯也很脏一点都配不上四星和它的价钱。2：卫生间淋浴下水很慢洗慢了要被淹，我住的是2702房。房间中央空调关闭后轴流风机还有声音是不是有阀门内漏造成。我都知道那专业的维修工怎么不知道呢？哈哈3：卫生间抽水马桶按下去就弹不上来了还要自己修。给酒店说过只是修好一次下次用同样地问题！！！！！！无语！！！！！4：除了维修工服务人员还比较满意。IT部的MM很好，我的“小黑”有系统问题造成黑屏她一针见血帮我找出问题提供修复方案，提出表扬。还有西餐厅的GG帮我定去灵武的出租车很好再次提出表扬！,"I booked a big bed room of 400 yuan a day through Ctrip.The cost -effective Yinchuan has Xiangyu and Bai Yue.Intersection1: The hotel facilities are too old.The carpet is also very dirty at all.2: The bathroom shower is very slow to wash and get flooded.

0,1、没有暖气，有欺骗嫌疑。28日入住大床间。由于近日气温下降厉害，订房间前特意电话询问房间是否有暖气，得到的答复是有。28日checkin时，又再次确认是否有暖气，答曰：有进入房间后打开暖气，简单洗漱后，赶紧睡觉。结果半夜被冻醒，房间非常冷。试了一下排气口，发现都是冷风，晕倒。赶紧电话询问客服人员，客服人员态度很好，说立即到房间查看。客服人员发现是冷风后，说没有办法解决，建议我多盖被子。晕倒！看看时间，此时已经凌晨2点多。没有办法，只能乖乖拿出房间备用的被子。早上起来后，我冻得发烧兼感冒。恼火～～～～～，赶紧拎着行李换宾馆。早上和前台反应，前台的人员面无表情，不知道为什么？2、席梦思上面没有任何铺垫物，直接铺了一层床单，那个席梦思也不知道用了多少年了。超级不舒服；这么冷的天气，下面没有褥子，房间没有暖气，这个冷啊。以后再也不敢住这样的宾馆了。3、一把伞拉在房间了，可是checkout时候，没有人提醒。我后来过了很久才发现。虽然只是一把伞，但是为什么就不能提醒客人呢。难道这很难么？,"1. There is no heating, and there is suspicion of deception.Check in the big bed on the 28th.As the temperature decreased sharply recently, before ordering the room, I asked for a special phone in the room to ask if there was heating in the room.On the 28th, I confirmed whether there was heating again on the 28th. I answered: After entering the room, open the heating, and after simply washing, go to bed quickly.As a result, it was frozen in the middle of the night, and the room was very cold.Try the exhaust mouth, and found that it was cold wind and fainted.Hurry up and ask the customer service staff. The customer service staff has a good attitude and said that he went to the room to check immediately.The customer service staff found that it was cold wind, and said that there was no way to solve it, it was recommended that I cover the quilt.faint!Look at the time, it was more than 2 am at this time.There is no way, you can only take out the quilt of the room.After getting up in the morning, I was frozen to have a fever and a cold.Annoyed ~~~~~, hurry up and change your luggage to the hotel.In the morning, the front desk reacted. The staff at the front desk had no expression. I don't know why?2. There was no paving on Xi Mengshi, and a layer of sheets were directly paved. The Xi Mengsi didn't know how many years it took.Super uncomfortable; such cold weather, there is no mattress underneath, there is no heating in the room, this is cold.I dare not stay in such a hotel again in the future.3. A umbrella is pulled in the room, but when there is no one, no one reminds.I later discovered it after a long time.Although it is just an umbrella, why can't we remind guests?Is this difficult?"
0,头一天订的是标间（大床）房，结果大床不大，两个人太拥挤，房间也太小。最不能容忍的是马桶居然和淋浴在一起，高的湿乎乎的，很不方便。第二天换了一间双床标间，房间倒是宽敞了许多，没想到的是楼下歌厅唱歌没完，搞到12点睡不着觉，这样的宾馆谁还敢住？,"The first day was the standard room (large bed) room. As a result, the big bed was not big, the two were too crowded, and the room was too small.The most unbearable thing is that the toilet is actually with the shower.The next day I changed a double -bed standard room. The room was much spacious. I didn't expect that the singing hall was singing downstairs. I couldn't sleep at 12 o'clock. Who dares to stay in such a hotel?"
0,酒店特别提示[2008/02/29-2008/08/30]酒店对面立交桥改造。携程提供的提示不准确，不是对面立交桥改造，根本就是门口的马路改造，再加上昆明道路好多都禁左，再遇上堵车。。。。。。2008/05/04刚住过，堵死我了。晚上10点从机场走的，开了1个多小时。酒店设施已经老了，要是不修路，到周围转转还行，服务员态度一般，入住的时候都是我自己拿着大包小包，开了房间也没人理，自己上去的。酒店的中餐不好吃，早餐的米线还行，但是品种太少，住了两天，第二天就吃腻了。,"The hotel special tips [2008/02/29-2008/08/30] opposite the hotel's standing bridge reconstruction.The prompts provided by Ctrip are inaccurate, not the transformation of the crossing bridge across the opposite side.

0,"整个酒店一股羊肉的臊味,11月了还没暖气,有空调,居然没有暖风,挨冻.......找遍整个房间没找到酒店任何服务电话,只有一个按摩的......半夜被汽车喇叭惊醒,以为窗户没关好,后来发现关的很严......只有开着电视,昏昏沉沉的居然听到了火车声......","The taste of a lamb in the entire hotel, there is no heating in November, there is air conditioning, there is no heating wind, it is frozen ...

0,房间超烂，看上去很破很旧，而且房间内还有一股长时间不开窗子的那种霉味，被子也很不舒服，而且也有味道，烧水的壶超级脏，根本没法用，房间也不提供收费的矿泉水，只能叫服务台的人给送，可人家竟然说要先付款，然后给我出去买，这是什么酒店啊，总之一个字――烂！劝大家最好别去！,"The room is extremely bad, it looks very old, and there is a moldy smell that does not open the window for a long time in the room.The room does not provide a charging mineral water.

0,我河南之旅住过最差的酒店，酒店年代久远，非常残旧，房间光线也不好，洗手间有异味，除了离相国寺近以外，离其他景点都不是很近。可能开封这个城市本身到处都是灰尘，酒店也好像到处都灰蒙蒙。免费自助早餐没有什么吃的，不过还算吃得饱,"My trip to Henan has lived in the worst hotel. The hotel has a long time, very disabled, and the light of the room is not good. There is a odor in the bathroom. Except for the near Xiangguo Temple, it is not very close to other attractions.Maybe Kaifeng this city itself is dusty, and the hotel seems to be gray everywhere.There is nothing to eat for free buffet breakfast, but it's still full"
0,刚从那儿回来。的确离大相国寺很近，离鼓楼夜市更近。但酒店住宿环境极差，标准B间在四楼，没有电梯，拎着箱子爬层高很高的四楼可不是一件轻松的事。房间里极其浓郁的异味，通风条件极差，又不敢开窗，因为对面居民区养了几条喜欢狂吠的大狗。总之下次去开封不会选择了。补充点评2008年5月2日：还有热水开了很久也不热，浪费啊！不过，前台接待是热情的，笑脸相迎。,"Just come back there.Indeed, it is very close to Daxiangguo Temple, closer to Gulou Night Market.However, the hotel's accommodation environment is very poor. The standard B is on the fourth floor. There is no elevator. It is not a relaxed on the fourth floor with a high climbing floor.The extremely strong odor in the room, the ventilation conditions were extremely poor, and did not dare to open the window, because there were a few big dogs who liked barking in the residential area.In short, I won't choose to go to Kaifeng next time.Supplementary comment on May 2, 2008: There are still hot water for a long time and it is not hot, waste!However, the front desk reception is enthusiastic, and the smiley face meets."
0,只住了一个晚上，房间很小，不过考虑到只是一个三星级的宾馆，要求也不能太高，但是房间里的设施很陈旧，而且有些设施明显坏很久了，也没有修理。我的信用卡不是国有四大银行的卡，不能做预售也就罢了，居然直接刷卡也不行，前台小姐居然说我的卡不是信用卡，狂晕，就算不认识visa标志，也应该认识银联的标志吧，怎么的也不会说连当成储蓄卡一样刷卡都不行吧！,"I only stayed for one night, and the room was small, but considering that it was just a three -star hotel, the requirements could not be too high, but the facilities in the room were very old, and some facilities were obviously bad for a long time, and it was not repaired.My credit card is not a card for the four major state -owned banks. You can't do pre -sale. Actually, you can swipe the card directly. The lady at the front desk actually said that my card is not a credit card.Let's not say that even if you use it as a savings card!"
0,床很大，但房间靠大街，路灯通过卫生间的玻璃照到房间里，影响睡眠。空调装在写字台的正上方，对着头吹，无法工作。,"The bed is very large, but the room is on the street. The street lights are shown in the room through the glass of the bathroom, which affects sleep.The air conditioner is installed directly above the writing desk, blowing facing the head and unable to work."
0,在喀什，如果通过ctrip预定，这是仅有的2个选择之一。优点：在汉人区，附近有夜市，房间里有宽带。缺点：虽然在喀什算是还凑合的，但条件还是很差（没错，我住的已经是这里的“贵宾楼”了），感觉房间陈旧20年；根本无法刷卡（虽然他们门可罗雀还要求你用信用卡担保...）；宽带设置烦琐，需要设置用户名密码；早餐也比较差，一楼设置的旅行社报价比其他地方贵。建议后来者不要看到这里有宽带或者方便通过ctrip预定就随手预定这家了，可能会影响你的出游心情。喀什现在听说新建了一个四星级酒店，塔西南石油管理局开的，我猜比这个会好。,"In Kashgar, if you book through CTRIP, this is one of the only two options.Advantages: In the Hanren District, there is a night market nearby, and there is broadband in the room.Disadvantages: Although it is still made in Kashgar, the conditions are still poor (yes, I have lived here the ""VIP Tower"" here), I feel that the room is old for 20 years;Credit card guarantee ...); Broadband settings are cumbersome and need to set up user names and passwords; breakfast is also poor, and travel agencies set on the first floor are more expensive than other places.It is recommended that the latecomers do not see that there is a broadband or convenient to book this one with CTRIP, which may affect your mood.Kashgar was heard that a new four -star hotel was built. The Southwest Petroleum Administration was opened. I guess it would be better than this."
0,酒店介绍和实际不符，达不到3星级标准，房间不紧张，还要求信用卡担保。到达现场后，客人不满意，最后选择宁可酒店扣除了房费，也选择了喀什的其他的酒店，那就是携程也未推荐的中西亚国际大酒店，价格和其相仿，但是其为四星标准。而且，携程与酒店的沟通做得不好，明明是酒店的介绍与实际有较大的偏差，而且价格比起当地旅行社的价格要高出30%，可是酒店方面还是扣除了我们订房的全部房费，我同样要考虑是否还继续使用携程作为我的选择。,"The introduction of the hotel is inconsistent with the actual situation. It does not meet the 3 -star standard, the room is not tight, and the credit card guarantee is required.After arriving at the scene, the guests were dissatisfied. Finally, I chose to deduct the room fee of Ningke Hotel, and also chose other hotels in Kashgar, that is, Ctrip ’s uncomfortable Central and Western international hotels.EssenceMoreover, the communication between Ctrip and the hotel is not well done. It is obviously that the hotel's introduction has a large deviation from the actuality, and the price is 30%higher than the price of the local travel agency.Fees, I also have to consider whether to continue using Ctrip as my choice."

0,千万不要住！首先是走廊和房间都一股发霉的味道！而且早餐超级难吃！最受不了的就是招待所级别的服务！我与同事（共2男）在9月10日晚大约8点50分办理入住。到达前台时，有两名当班服务员，均在为另外两位住客办理手续。我在旁边等候，没有人跟我说“请稍候”之类的礼貌用语。等办理完那两个住客了，服务员也不理我，是我自己主动说订了房的。然后其中一位服务员一边丢给我一张登记表，一边和一个不明身份的人（在前台前，未穿着任何制服）聊天。在我办理入住手续期间，该名服务员一直和那个人聊天。服务员一直没有和我确认房,"Don't live!The first is a moldy taste in the corridor and room!And breakfast is super unpalatable!The most unbearable is the service of the guesthouse level!I and my colleagues (2 men in total) were checked at about 8:50 on the evening of September 10.When they arrived at the front desk, there were two servicemen in class, both of which were procedures for the other two residents.I waited next to me, and no one told me polite words such as ""please wait.""When the two residents were completed, the waiter ignored me, and I took the initiative to book a house.Then one of the waiters left me a registration form while chatting with an unknown person (before the front desk, not wearing any uniforms).During my check -in procedures, the waiter kept chatting with that person.The waiter has never confirmed the room with me"

The door lock is difficult to close the door.It is said that the IT people are resting and fainting ~~ The hygiene in the room is very sloppy. The two rooms in our room are medicine for a few days, and the windows can not be scattered; one has a smoke, but the window cannot be opened at all.There is an egg, and there is an item left by the previous guest in the drawer. The most exaggerated is the toilet. There is no compartment in the shower.So I can go in. I didn't want to say that breakfast at all. The supply time at 7-9 points is simply garbage. Later, I don't even want them to have breakfast vouchers. The receptionist at the front desk is polite, but Checkout is slow.Later, I learned that the people in the house must be given to us after checking the house.

0,酒店在装修，整体感觉特别不好，正门都走不了，车也不让停，服务人员也不协助找停车的地方，哪里像是五星的服务水准？房间卫生状况也不是很理想，备品也不像是五星级的，比如牙刷根本就是劣质产品。酒店整体的软性服务也需要提升，看得出是个管理很一般的饭店，服务有员整体素质一般。,"The hotel is decorated. The overall feeling is particularly not good. The main entrance cannot be left, the car does not stop, and the service staff will not help find a place where the parking is. Where is the service level of the five -star service?The hygiene of the room is not ideal, and the reserve is not like a five -star. For example, toothbrushes are inferior products.The overall soft service of the hotel also needs to be improved. It can be seen that it is a very ordinary restaurant, and the overall quality of the service staff."
0,春节前往香港度假，入住富豪东方酒店。该酒店价格不低，可条件却不高。交通不便，服务一般般（国内快捷酒店水平）房间内的硬件设施还不如快捷酒店，很旧很旧的家具。房间始终弥漫着一股潮、霉的味道。晚上楼道里空调机房的声音整晚都不停，就像轰炸机在头顶盘旋。服务员看见洋鬼子比他爹还亲，对祖国大陆客人完全两样。酒店的位置很蹩脚，很难叫到出租车，小巴很近的距离就6块，5个人出门就30块比的士还贵。不推荐大家入住.......,"Go to Hong Kong for vacation in the Spring Festival and stay at the rich oriental hotel.The hotel's price is not low, but the conditions are not high.The hardware facilities in the room (domestic express hotel level) in the room are not as good as the fast hotel.The room is always filled with a tide and moldy taste.At night, the sound of the air -conditioned machine room in the channel kept all night, just like the bombers hovered over the head.The waiter saw that foreign devils were more kissed than his father, and they were exactly the same as guests of the motherland.The hotel's location is very stunned, it is difficult to call taxis. The minibus is very close to 6 yuan. Five people go out to 30 yuan.Don't recommend everyone to stay ......."

0,酒店的设施和服务与描述及其不相符硬件最多2.5星水平，卫生状况一般，床单上有洗不掉的污渍，床上有沙粒（？？？！！！），房门不隔音...早餐只有泡饭和咸菜，而且每人只有1小碗，因为添加的话，后面来的客人就连泡饭也吃不到了。虽然是春节期间，但这样的服务也太匪夷所思了。我以前通过携程预定过全国各地的房间，发现有夸大星级的情况，但还不算离谱。携程网上酒店的描述和酒店实际质量差别如此之大，我是第一次遇到。德清的雅兰和荣盛山庄的硬件和服务要好几个档次。据我所了解的携程操作程序，网上酒店的说明和照片是酒店自己上传的。我建议携程适当做一些抽查和复核，类似卢球假日这样的情况，会极大影响用户对携程的信任，虽然信息资料是酒店提供的。,"The hotel's facilities and services and descriptions and they do not match the hardware up to 2.5 star levels. The sanitary conditions are average. There are stains that cannot be washed on the sheets.Breakfast only has rice and pickles, and each person has only 1 small bowl, because if you add it, the guests who come later will not even eat rice.Although it is during the Spring Festival, such services are too busty.I used to book rooms across the country through Ctrip, and I found that there was exaggeration to star, but it was not outrageous.The description of the Ctrip online hotel is so different from the actual quality of the hotel, I have encountered it for the first time.The hardware and services of Yalan and Rongsheng Villa in Deqing are several grades.According to the Ctrip operation procedures I know, the instructions and photos of the online hotel were uploaded by the hotel itself.I suggest that Ctrip do some random checks and reviews appropriately. Similar to Luqiu holidays will greatly affect users' trust in Ctrip, although the information is provided by the hotel."

The traffic is far from the subway but there are more buss.It is convenient to take a bus.You can take 26 (A22 as the airport line) to Tsim Sha Tsui, which is more convenient and faster than the subway, only 20 minutes"
0,服务态度很不好，除了免费的水，1瓶衣云收60，太黑了，那天去开什么外资企业洽谈会，全是些中国老表在哪里混，有鬼的外资企业。真烦！,"The service attitude is very bad. Except for free water, 1 bottle of clothing is 60, which is too dark. On that day, what foreign -funded enterprise negotiations were held.Really annoying!"
0,"借壳原来的天津乐园宾馆现在居然是“4”星级酒店，环境太乱,和演艺场在一起,像娱乐场所,不像宾馆,到处是穿着睡衣的人们在走动，特别是早餐，连2星的宾馆都不如；真不知道那些评论星级酒店的官员们在这里的洗浴中心享受过什么特别待遇。。。。","The original Tianjin Paradise Hotel is now a ""4"" star hotel.

0,酒店在沙田的河边，风景不错。但是似乎因为都是大陆人入住的原因，服务员的态度十分恶劣。我晚上问他们要求上网，有个服务员骗我到外面买上网卡，后来投诉也不理我。,"The hotel is by the river in Shatian. The scenery is good.However, it seems that because the mainlanders are staying in, the waiter's attitude is very bad.I asked them to ask for the Internet at night. A waiter lied to me to buy a network card outside, but later the complaint ignored me."

The air conditioner is extremely cold and the temperature is not regulated. It can only be turned off before going to bed, but it still has a cold.

0,这是我住过的最差的酒店了。我指的是管理。1前台对宾馆位置不熟悉，宁波过来的出租车问他是否在新区，就听到前台一边听电话，一边翻纸头的声音，估计是地图，汗。。。2问有否无烟房，答，房间里都有烟灰缸，一般不抽，可是客人要抽也没法控制。晕！需要培训无烟房的概念？3酒店结帐时有电话消费，我说不可能，我都是打手机的。前台再三说肯定不会弄错。我查了时间，突然想起那段时间我进房间有看到电工在自说自话修房间的灯（我没有报修过）。我就让他们查记录，总算查到是打前厅主管的手机，酒店自己人用客人房间电话打手机，还诬赖客人，真是闻所未闻。4让酒店洗衣时特地有分开水洗和干洗，傻瓜都明白干洗的肯定比较脏。结果送来时像没洗过样。质疑后说重洗，耽误了我的穿用切不说，第二天我就要退房，让送别的我即将住的酒店，满口答应。可是退房时却无人知道此事。如果我不是多个心眼问一句，恐怕衣服就石沉大海了。说好送来的，时间过了也没送，后来再打电话催促，总算送来了，可是让我更失望的是居然还是没洗干净，而且奇怪的是本来干净的地方也出现点点油斑，真不知道是在洗衣服还是在穿衣服。严重怀疑该酒店外包洗衣处的出身。5电工修灯也不跟客人打招呼，客房出入没有第二人在场。修完后墙灰都在被面上，没人打扫。6携程拿房靠近附近的夜总会，晚上吵到十二点钟才安歇。投诉后也没说可以换房。总之对此宾馆印象极差。宾馆反馈2007年11月9日：首先酒店对客人表示深深的歉意，也很感谢您提的这些意见。酒店已加强对员工的培训力度，让每位员工有更强的服务意识。我们会好好吸收各位客人的意见及批评，有则改之，无则加冕。希望各位客人是我们酒店的监督员，在你们的监督下让我们做的更好。谢谢！,"This is the worst hotel I have lived.I mean management.1 The front desk is not familiar with the location of the hotel. The taxi from Ningbo came to ask him if he was in the new district, so he heard the sound of the front desk listening to the phone. While turning the paper head, it was estimated that it was a map and sweat.EssenceEssence2 Ask if there are no smoke rooms. Answer, there are ashtray in the room. Generally, you do n’t smoke, but the guests cannot control it.faint!Need to train the concept of smokeless houses?3 The hotel has a telephone consumption when checking out. I said it is impossible.The front desk will never be wrong.I checked the time, and suddenly remembered that during that time I entered the room and saw that the electrician was talking about repairing the room (I haven't reported it).I asked them to check the records. Finally, I found that the mobile phone of the front hall was in charge. The hotel used the guest room to call the phone by the guest room. It was really unheard of.4 Let the hotel have special washing and dry cleaning when washing the hotel. Fools must understand that dry cleaning must be dirty.As a result, I did not wash the sample when they were sent.After questioning, I said heavy washing, delaying my dressing and cutting. The next day I was going to check out, and I asked the hotel I was about to stay, and agreed.But no one knew about it when checking out.If I do n’t ask multiple eyes, I am afraid the clothes will be sinking.It ’s good to send it, and the time did n’t send it. Later, I called and urged it. Finally, I was sent, but what made me even more disappointed was that I did n’t wash it.I really don't know if they are washing clothes or wearing clothes.Seriously doubt the origin of the hotel outsourcing and laundry.5 Electrician lamps do not say hello to guests. No second person is present in the guest rooms.After the repair of the wall, the wall ash was all surfaced, and no one was cleaned.6 Ctrip took the house near the nearby nightclub, and noisy at night until twelve o'clock in the evening.After the complaint, I didn't say that I could change the house.In short, the hotel is very impressive.Hotel feedback on November 9, 2007: First of all, the hotel expressed deep apology for the guests, and thank you for your opinion.The hotel has strengthened the training of employees to give each employee a stronger sense of service.We will absorb the opinions and criticisms of all guests.I hope that everyone is the supervisor of our hotel. Under your supervision, let us do better.Thanks!"

0,和山里的农庄比算是好的了吧。墙壁都开裂了，房间还算干净，离镇上有1公里吧，叫车只要2元。镇上有上海华联，还挺大的，买些吃的喝的用的都挺方便。,"It is better than the farm in the mountains.The walls are cracking, and the rooms are clean.

0,房间灯光很暗，地毯很脏，发现并踩死一只蟑螂！牙膏是假货，毛巾千万别用，相信您看了也不会用的，要自备。我在登记入住时，听到一名像是管理人员的人和另一名导游说：“这点小事，让他们投诉好了。”我顿时后悔定在这么个地方！如果携程的评分还有0分的话，我一定全部给他们打0分。建议您多花点钱，多开点车，选别处入住吧！,"The room lights are very dark, the carpet is dirty, and a cockroach is found and died!Toothpaste is a fake product. Do not use towels. I believe you wo n’t use it when you look at it.When I registered, I heard a person like a manager and another guide saying: ""This little thing makes them complain.""

0,对这家酒店感觉非常的不满意，酒店的服务和设施以及地点都非常非常的差，特别的硬件设施不是水管坏了，就是电视有问题。半夜居然爆水管，在住的几个晚上里没有睡到一个安稳觉，投诉同楼层的韩国客人太吵，在投诉其吵闹的时候不专业的接线人员竟然要求我在半夜时分去查看是哪一个房间的客人，简直是莫明奇秒，不知道香港的服务人员的专业素养跑到了哪里去了。。。。莫明。。。。酒店的地理位置也非常不理想如果想节省时间都需要打的到地铁站，如果你买了太多东西，相信我回酒店真的是一件非常痛苦的事，没有出租车，没有地铁。。。。。。,"It feels very dissatisfied with this hotel. The hotel's service, facilities and locations are very, very poor. The special hardware facilities are either a water pipe or a problem with television.In the middle of the night, the water pipe was burst. In the past few nights, I did n’t sleep to have a sense of peace. The Korean guests on the same floor were too noisy.

0,来长春之前，查阅了携程的很多酒店评分，感觉这个还算不错的，但是入住之后感觉很失望：1、房间门坏了；2、空调不好；3、房间陈旧；4、服务一般。。。。总之性价比很低，早餐还算可以。,"Before coming to Changchun, I checked a lot of hotel scores from Ctrip. I felt that this was pretty good, but I felt disappointed after check -in: 1. The door door was broken; 2. The air conditioner was not good; 3. The room was old; 4. The service was average.EssenceEssenceEssenceIn short, the cost performance is very low, and breakfast is okay."
0,房间设施陈旧，服务一般，由于中午到的酒店，网络调试需要帮助，居然说中午人都休息了，得等1点以后上班，靠。早餐还是很丰富的，下次不会住了，性价比不高。,"The room facilities are old and the service is average. Due to the hotel at noon, online debugging needs to help. It is said that people have rest at noon.Breakfast is still very rich. I won't live next time, and the price is not high."
0,在预定时间到前台进行登记时，服务人员告诉我们：XC没有进行预定，后来通过多次电话......，另外，预定价格和门市价格只有4元价差......,"When registering at the front desk at the predetermined time, the service staff told us: XC did not make a reservation, and later passed multiple calls ... In addition, the predetermined price and the store price were only 4 yuan."
0,这个酒店的所有设施是在是太陈旧了。早餐简直没法下咽。洗澡水小得没法洗澡。房间里尽然没有写字台，害我要座在自己的行李箱上，趴在行李架上上网。本来我想算了就住两天，将就一下吧。可是晚上看电视的时候尽然有一只大老鼠在我面前跑过，吓死我了。没办法第二天一早换酒店。,"All the facilities of this hotel are too old.Breakfast couldn't swallow.Bathing water is too small to take a bath.I did not write in the room, and I was going to sit on my suitcase and lay on the Internet on the luggage rack.I wanted to forget it for two days, and I would just take it.But when I watched TV at night, a big mouse ran past me and scared me.There is no way to change the hotel early the next morning."
0,刚从九洲环宇换到这个酒店，感觉差距太大了，这里号称在市中心，但周围除了天宁寺，没别的。房间有点旧了，老式格局，洗澡水很小。价钱比九洲环宇要高30%多，觉得非常非常不值。再也不会选择这里了，除非价钱降到200以下。,"I just changed from Jiuzhou Huanyu to this hotel. I feel that the gap is too large. It is called in the city center, but there is nothing else except Tianning Temple.The room is a bit old, the old format, the bath water is small.The price is more than 30%higher than Jiuzhou Huanyu, and it feels very, very bad.I will never choose here, unless the price drops to less than 200."
0,从去年开始就在装修，说是要升4星，房间还是老样子。晚上8点半开始酒店扩建的施工地钻机和挖土机开始嘶叫了，我朦胧睡着时应该是10点多了～还在工作，本来想拍照下来的，但是施工地没有开大灯，只有机器上的小灯没法拍摄。洗澡，竟然碰到莲蓬头没法出水，只能下面水龙头出水。因为已经‘衣衫不整’人也太累就没找客房了，混一夜再说。第二天中午携程来电话问我是否入住，大概意思说酒店没有说我入住，太不负责任了。也请携程以后签约酒店时能实地去看看到底什么情况，龙游大酒店这种情况真的不如龙游那些小宾馆！！！我住的是403可以去核实！！！,"Since last year, I have been renovating, saying that I want to rise 4 stars, and the room is still the same.Starting at 8:30 in the evening, the hotel's expanded construction rig and excavator began to scream. When I fell asleep, I should be more than 10 o'clock ~ I was still working.Only small lights on the machine cannot be shot.When I took a bath, I couldn't get out of the shower head. I could only go out of the water.Because people who have been ‘unpretentious’ are too tired, they do n’t find the guest room, and say it overnight.At noon the next day, Ctrip asked me if I was checked. I probably said that the hotel did not say that I was checked, and it was too irresponsible.Also please see what the situation can be seen on the spot when signing the hotel in the future.

0,对于这家酒店，我非常愤怒！我是前天入住，前台服务员热情的告诉我，只要我签协议，酒店能给我比携程更低的价格！酒店的设施及其脏乱，而且没有服务员，房间地毯让人恶心，满墙的死蚊子的印迹。最可怕的是昨天竟然中午时分停电，之后听说是酒店失火，很严重，所有的电源设备全停了（包括网络、电话），之后的酒店乱成一团，听说要最快地二天下午来电，所有的客人都苍忙退房。由于入住时是用的信用卡预授权，结果没电无法使用，只有现金结账（四星级酒店竟然没有两条电路！），服务员说来电后会马上向银行发传真，3天后到账，并承诺传真后立刻电话通知我。结果，今天下午三点多我电话询问酒店，说今天上午就来电，但是还没有发传真（忘了），酒店说马上发传真，并肯定说3天后到账。之后，我四点电话询问银行，说刚收到传真，但是明确告诉我，到账需要19天之后（程序所致）！对于这家酒店，我只能打1分！,"I am very angry about this hotel!I stayed in the day before yesterday, and the front desk waiter told me enthusiastically that as long as I signed the agreement, the hotel can give me a lower price than Ctrip!The hotel's facilities are dirty, and there are no waiters. The carpets are disgusting, and the marks of dead mosquitoes on the wall.The most terrible thing is that the power outage was stopped at noon yesterday. After that, I heard that the hotel was caught fire. It was very serious. All the power supply equipment stopped (including the Internet, telephone). After that, the hotel was chaotic.All guests are busy checking out.Because the credit card is pre -authorized during the check -in, there is no power to be used. Only the cash checkout (there are no two circuits in the four -star hotel!), The waiter will send a fax to the bank immediately after call, arrive after 3 days later, and promise to promiseI immediately called me after faxing.As a result, I asked the hotel at three o'clock this afternoon and said that the call came from this morning, but I did not send a fax (forgot). The hotel said that the fax was issued immediately, and it must be said after 3 days.After that, I asked the bank at four o'clock and said that I had just received the fax, but I clearly told me that it would take 19 days after the account (the program)!For this hotel, I can only score 1 point!"
0,这是我有生以来住过的最差的酒店，竟然早上六点多会有个疯女人来砸门，而酒店的保安无动于衷，我去投诉竟然说是敲错了门。酒店的监控形同虚设，以后绝不会再住了。服务质量绝对需要提高，不配挂准四星的牌。,"This is the worst hotel I have lived in my lifetime. There will be a crazy woman to smash the door at 6 o'clock in the morning, and the hotel's security is indifferent. I went to complain that it was knocked on the wrong door.The monitoring of the hotel is virtual, and it will never live anymore in the future.The quality of service needs to be improved, and it is not equipped with a four -star card."

It is not a ""advanced business hotel"" at all. It should be the same ""artillery shop"" as Motai 168. The entire room is decorated with red tone, which is similar to the brothel. The bed is indeed round. There are cockroaches at night.When checking out, the front desk could not figure out how to convert pre -authorization into consumption. It tossed for a long time.

0,本以为三星级的宾馆还过得去，订了四个单间，总台服务员见我们是外地的，给我们的单间最小的竟然只有6个平方米，另一间霉味特重，条件显然不符合三星级单间标准，我们要求退房，不行。住6平方的是个驾驶员，不敢说，以为我给他安排的就是这么大。后来得知与总台交涉，才勉强给我们换了两个房间。我们同行的一致认为，这家酒店太差劲了。评价：服务态度差、房间差、没停车场……反正一切都糟糕透顶，第二天立马换地方。本会员评价绝无假话，建议不要选此家酒店。,"I thought that the three -star hotel was still able to pass. I ordered four single rooms. The waiter of the main station saw that we were in the field.

0,第一天去办入住手续时，前台的大姐一直掉着个脸，直到办完手续，眼皮也没抬一下，订的大床房给的却是双人房，只好又回前台去换，那位大姐始终也没抬眼皮。房间里竟然没有衣柜，没有袋泡茶，让人有些不习惯，但房间打扫得到是很干净，还有免费宽带。卫生间没有浴缸，早餐品种极少，酒店也只有一部电梯，很不方便，所以本来预订五天的，住了两天就退房了。,"When I went to check in on the first day, the elder sister in the front desk kept falling off. Until the procedure was completed, the eyelids were not lifted.The eldest sister never raised her eyelids.There is no wardrobe in the room and no bags of tea, which is a bit unaccustomed, but the room cleaning is clean and free of broadband.There are no bathtubs in the bathroom, there are very few breakfast varieties, and there are only one elevator in the hotel, which is very inconvenient, so those who have been booking for five days were originally booked. After staying for two days, they went out to check out."
0,"先生在8/29入住时,收银台人员竟然可以将入住刷卡时的预授权800元当做消费来给客人刷信用卡,还打算撕走一张凭证,当时没注意到,但幸好三张凭证都要回来了.9/5,发现问题后,先生给酒店的收银台打了电话,在现在9/7号,都没人回复.真是素质与服务都不是一般的差!幸好另外找了信用卡银行在跟进了,真不知这800元最后会怎么样呢.补充点评2007年9月7日：在离开酒店结帐时,又说原来预授权(实际是消费)的卡用不了,要提供另一张信用卡,先生也不知就里,就用了另一张卡结帐离开了,仔细想想,这会不会是个局啊?稍不小心,800元就不知贡献给谁了?","When the sir stays in 8/29, the cashier staff can even use the pre -authorized 800 yuan when the check -in card is used as a consumption to use the credit card for the guests.

It was really bad quality and service! Fortunately, I found a credit card bank in another way.Follow up, I really do n’t know how this 800 yuan will be in the end. Supplementary comment on September 7, 2007: When leaving the hotel to check out, it is said that the original pre -authorized (actually consumption) card cannot be used. You need to provide another anotherZhang's credit card, Mr., did not know, and used another card to check out. Think about it, will this be a game? Slightly careless, I do n’t know who contributed to 800 yuan?"

0,我在9月19日入住的，本来在携程网上预定了3天，但是酒店的前台在我入住的时候，都没有问我要住几天就开了一个一天的票给我。当时真是非常的生气。也没有计较，就住进去了，22日离开的。结果回来携程通知我我只完成了1天的入住，只给我1天的积分。郁闷！入住当晚，酒店就进了一个团队，打麻将打倒3点多钟，吵得难以入睡。而且酒店的位置在张家界森林公园，游览武陵源风景区不是很方便。,"I stayed on September 19th and had been scheduled for 3 days on Ctrip.com, but when the hotel's front desk was in my stay, I didn't ask me to leave a day for a day for a few days.It was really angry at the time.There was no care, so I lived in and left on the 22nd.As a result, Ctrip inform me that I only completed the check -in for one day, and only gave me 1 day's points.depressed!On the night of staying, the hotel entered a team, playing mahjong down for more than 3 o'clock, and it was difficult to sleep.In addition, the hotel is located in Zhangjiajie Forest Park. It is not very convenient to visit the Wulingyuan Scenic Area."
0,2月2日，我在这里住了一晚。由于有事情需要处理，我到下午4点才退房。根据酒店前台告示牌的说明：12点后退房的，每超过一小时需收费20元，最多收取50%房费（下午6点前退的）。这样，我应该另外再付80元。当付款时，服务人员（经理也在）则坚持要收我半天的房费（全天是178元）。我就根据他们告示写的据理力争，后来，他们表面认可我的观点。然后让我刷卡结帐，由于他的终端机器上没有显示具体金额的数字，我输入了密码，确认了。结果等打印出来的签单一看，数字是89元，而非80元。我拒绝在签单上签字。（后来问招商银行，银行说只要打印出来就有效，不管签字与否！我就奇怪，那签单上的签字有什么用？）服务人员包括那个经理，见他们小把戏得逞，在一边暗自高兴。我觉得很气愤，为这样没有信誉的员工，以及他们的落后意识。也不想想，因为自己的不道德，导致消费者对他们公司也产生不信任，这种后果是区区9元钱能比较的吗？后来我投诉到总店，过了一小时左右接到这个店经理的电话。基本意思是，有两种方案，1、我去店里拿下9元钱（而我这时候已经在武昌候车厅等待上车了！）2、下次还住这家店，给我补，并且按照比写成优惠很多的价格和我结算。我心想，真是无聊的很。我去拿？可能吗？我叫出租来回还要40多呢，且不说我时间。下次住？可能吗？别说你这个店，整个扬子江我都不会选择了。这种小聪明，欺骗消费者，最终决定了扬子江将是一家没有什么前景的企业。大家在入住前也仔细考虑下，别因为自己良好的愿望而向我一样遭遇到没必要的烦恼。,"On February 2, I lived here for one night.Because something needs to be handled, I will not check out until 4 pm.According to the instructions of the hotel's front desktop signboard: If you check out after 12 o'clock, you need to charge 20 yuan for each more than an hour, and charge up to 50%of the house fee (retired before 6 pm).In this way, I should pay another 80 yuan.When paying, the service staff (the manager is also there) insists on collecting my half -day room fee (178 yuan throughout the day).I was based on the reason they wrote, and later, they apparently recognized my point of view.Then let me check out the card. Since the number of the specific amount was not displayed on his terminal machine, I entered the password and confirmed.As a result, the printing list was printed, and the number was 89 yuan instead of 80 yuan.I refused to sign on the sign.(Later, I asked China Merchants Bank that the bank said that as long as it was printed, it would be valid, regardless of the signature! I am strange, what is the use of signing on the signing form?) The service staff includes the manager who sees them a small drama and secretly be happy.I feel very angry, for such employees who have no reputation and their backward consciousness.I don't want to think about it, because their own immorality has caused consumers to have no trust in their companies. Can this consequence be compared with 9 yuan?Later, I complained to the head store and received a call from this store manager in about an hour.The basic meaning is that there are two solutions, 1. I went to the store to get 9 yuan (and I have already waited for the car in the Wushang waiting hall at this time!) 2. I will return to this store next time and make up for me.And settle a lot of discounts with me as well as me.I thought to myself, it's really boring.I'll get it?is it possible?My name is more than 40 to rent back and forth, and don't say my time.Next time?is it possible?Don't say you, I won't choose the whole Yangtze River.This little clever, deceiving consumers, finally decided that Yangtze River will be a company with no prospects.Before you stay, you also consider it carefully, don't encounter unnecessary troubles like me because of their good wishes."
0,前几日山西旅游到大同，通过电话定了这个酒店。总体感觉非常不爽。房间刚刚够上三星标准，偏偏报了一个四星；入住后感觉就是一个洗浴中心，房间不隔音也比较乱。第二天结帐又是内部结算又是房间内的物品损坏，上去一看又说查错了，真的不知道搞什么。下回请携程推荐时注意一下酒店品味。不要砸招牌。,"A few days ago, Shanxi Traveling to Datong, the hotel was determined by phone.The overall feels very uncomfortable.The room has just been enough for the Samsung standard, and a four -star is reported; after check -in, it feels like a bathing center, and the room is not sound insulation.The next day was the internal settlement and the items in the room were damaged.

0,我们总共住了3晚。我在预定前已清楚地注明希望高层房间，当天达到时才4点多，酒店就以房间已开完了为理由给我们安排了一个没有窗的一楼房间，当时是一位男前台办理的，而且完全不理会我的预定要求。我的家人由于是老人家，没有窗觉得非常憋气，而且蚊子多得像开飞机。过了半小时，我来到前台要求换房，另一位男前台二话没说就换了一间房，但还是在一楼，好在可以透气。但蚊子还是一抓一把，酒店解释：厦门这个季节就是以蚊子多著名的。接下来我打电话给携程要求协调，但也没有成功。我心想换一家酒店，但老人家又不想折腾，因此在第3天才换了一间二楼的房给我们。我觉得携程应该重视客户的预定需求，要求酒店满足，如不能满足要告知客人，否则去到酒店还要生一场闷气，什么旅游的兴致都没有了。,"We lived for 3 nights.I have clearly stated that I hope the high -rise rooms have been clearly stated before the booking. It was only 4 o'clock on the same day. The hotel had arranged a room without a window for the reason for the room.And ignore my scheduled requirements at all.Because my family is an old man, there is no window and feels very stingy, and mosquitoes are like flying planes.After half an hour, I came to the front desk for a house to change the house. I changed a room without saying a word at the front desk, but it was still on the first floor. Fortunately, it was breathable.But the mosquito is still grabbing, the hotel explains: Xiamen is famous for this season with more mosquitoes.Next I called Ctrip to ask for coordination, but it was not successful.I want to change a hotel, but the old man does not want to toss, so I changed the room on the second floor on the third day to us.I think Ctrip should pay attention to the needs of customers, asking the hotel to meet.

Basically, it does not belong to those who can't laugh or are more than playing NB. According to the theory of the other party, who lets us be a foreigner?It ’s good to live for us.

0,对天津这个城市，对天津的老饭店，是很有感情的，但这一次确实让我失望了。曾经住过利顺德，就对老饭店有一种美好的憧憬，但是这一家的确有太多要改进的！！要不然怎么能让顾客再次登门呢？第一饭店的地理位置很好，晚上很安静，房间很高，但是走廊里就有很浓的烟味，换了两个房间，依然如此，从晚上9点进房一直开窗开门换气到夜里12点，关上门窗睡觉，依然觉得难受，可能我不抽烟，对烟味非常反感的缘故吧，俺只好把随身带的香水放在枕边，这样才睡着。气味不好，让我对这家饭店的洁净程度的印象大打折扣。服务员，一点都不服务，换房时，让俺自己拖着行李跑上跑下，跟我说，前台没人了，是在走不开，我下去一看，三个姐姐呢，咋说“没人”？我说房间有味，她跟我说“不可能！”难道我自己折腾自己不成？早餐呢，的确实很贵，太对不住它的价钱。总之，很失望，是不会再去住了。,"It is very emotional to the city of Tianjin and the old restaurant in Tianjin, but this time it really disappointed me.I once lived in Lishunde, and I had a beautiful longing for the old restaurant, but there are indeed too much to improve this family!IntersectionOtherwise, how can we let customers come to the door again?The geographical location of the first hotel is very good. It is quiet at night and the room is very high, but there is a strong smoke flavor in the corridor. After changing two rooms, this is still the case.At 12 o'clock in the night, when I closed the doors and windows to sleep, I still felt uncomfortable. Maybe I didn't smoke, and I was very disgusted with the smell of smoke. I had to put the perfume with my back on the pillow so that I fell asleep.The smell was not good, and the impression of the cleanliness of this restaurant was greatly reduced.The waiter, not served at all. When changing the room, let me dragged my luggage and ran up and told me that there is no one at the front desk.no one""?I said that the room was tasteful, and she said to me, ""Impossible!"" Can I toss myself?Breakfast is indeed very expensive, and it is too expensive.In short, I am disappointed and I won't go to live again."
0,酒店位置很偏，大厅很漂亮，可是房间里有刚装修的味道，房间偏暗，床也偏低，给人压抑的感觉。退房后酒店反馈给携程说客人没有如期入住，也让客人很不舒服。,"The hotel location is very biased, the hall is very beautiful, but the room has the taste of just renovation. The room is darker and the bed is low, giving people a feeling of depression.After checking out the hotel, the hotel feedback to Ctrip said that the guests did not move in as scheduled, which also made the guests uncomfortable."
0,说是9层在装修！但是住5层还是吵得睡不着。怀疑6层也在装修，声音就在头顶。电钻6、7点就开始吵。头痛欲裂。地点很不好找。不临街。宾馆反馈2008年6月2日：尊敬的客人：您好！您在入住期间未能享受到安静的环境，我们深感不安，并向您表示深切的歉意。为了创造酒店优美环境，使广大宾客居住环境更加舒适，我店正在进行客房硬件的装修改造工作，施工时间为8：00－20：00，非常抱歉施工单位未在规定时间内施工，还打扰了您的休息，为此，我们已经与施工方再次接洽，要求他们遵守工作时间，杜绝此类事件的再次发生。酒店楼顶正装修并安装本市最具特色的标志建筑：“金葫芦”，相信您再次光临本店时会给您焕然一新的感觉，更会让您感受到我们更热诚的服务。再次谢谢您的忠肯评价，并真诚地向您表示歉意，恳请您能再次下榻并提出宝贵意见！祝您身体健康，工作顺利、万事如意！,"Said to be renovated in the 9th floor!But staying on the 5th floor still can't sleep.Suspecting the 6th floor is also decorating, and the sound is above the head.Electric diamonds started to make noisy at 6 or 7.Headache cracks.The location is very difficult to find.Do not go to the street.Hotel feedback on June 2, 2008: Dear guest: Hello!You failed to enjoy a quiet environment during your stay, we felt deeply disturbed and expressed deep apologies to you.In order to create a beautiful environment in the hotel and make the living environment more comfortable in the living environment, our store is being renovated and renovated in the hardware of the guest rooms.

0,"服务非常差,环境不好~建议别去~提前一个星期就定好了,并且定了加床,到了前台告诉我们能加闯的房间没了,现在不能加床~~后来打了携程电话帮忙沟通,才得到解决,解决的办法就是把房间里的椅子和桌子都搬出去了,才加进一张床,我们几乎没有活动空间.~~~~~~总之跟服务台说什么他们都不答应,都不能得到解决.非常不开心.后来我们发现分明有能加床的大房间空着,就是不给我们开,真是太不愉快的记忆了","The service is very poor, the environment is not good ~ It is recommended not to go ~ it will be fixed a week in advance, and the bed is set.

Later, we found that there is a large room that can be added to bed, but it is not given us. It is really unpleasant to remember it."
0,群众的眼睛是雪亮的，这个店的服务确实奇差，可能随着溪口旅游的迅速发展，这些宾馆有些暴发户的心态吧，不知道什么是服务。早餐时，一大群服务员在入口处，就是没有一个人理你，没有餐具，非要用很大的声音，才会有一点反应，过来就要餐券，一看也没有什么吃的，干脆把餐券撕了不吃。对于我这样小时候生活在山里的人来说，溪口没什么值得来的特别价值，交通不便，从机场只能打的而且等了30分钟才有出租车，在溪口本地多半都是震耳欲聋的火三轮作为基本交通工具，稍晚一点从蒋介石母亲墓道回来就没有车（下午5点过）。我不是来旅游的，我看那些来旅游的好像以官员居多（不晓得是共产党还是国民党的），来这里可能是想向介石学习怎样两面三刀摆平军阀的本事。这个宾馆确实没什么优点，倒是出门左边的新豪门酒店吃饭不错，干净清爽，本地人也很多在这里吃饭。千万不要到溪边的饭店去吃啊，同一个菜，在一个菜谱上有两个或三个价格，你点的时候如油焖笋（18元），结帐时就是红烧笋（25元）了，你点芋艿排骨（25元），结帐时就使芋艿排骨煲（35元）了。领教了，这些溪口邻居除了把老蒋的阴险狡诈传承了下来，好像没别的了。补充点评2007年4月8日：我选的服务1分，怎么成了2分？,"The eyes of the masses are clear. The service of this store is indeed poor. It may be that with the rapid development of Xikou tourism. Some of these hotels have some upstarts' mentality. I don't know what service is.During breakfast, a large group of waiters are at the entrance, but no one cares about you, no tableware, and there must be a big voice to react. If you come hereThe meal coupon tears or not eat.For those who live in the mountains when I was a child, Xikou was not worthy of special value. The traffic was inconvenient. It could only be played from the airport and waited for 30 minutes to have a taxi. Most of the locals in Xikou were deafening fires.As a basic transportation, three rounds of transportation, a little later from the tomb of Chiang Kai -shek's mother, there was no car (at 5 pm).I am not here to travel. I think those who come to travel seem to be the most of the officials (do not know it is the Communist Party or the Kuomintang). When I come here, I may want to learn how to settle the warlords on both sides and three knives.There is really no advantage of this hotel, but the new wealthy hotel on the left is good, clean and refreshing, and many locals also eat here.Do not eat at the restaurant by the stream. The same dish has two or three prices on a recipe. When you order it, it is like oil bamboo shoots (18 yuan).), You ordered taro pork ribs (25 yuan), and the taro pork ribs were made (35 yuan) at checkout.I have taught, these Xikou neighbors have nothing else except for the insidious and cunning of Lao Jiang.Supplementary comment on April 8, 2007: I choose 1 point, how can I get 2 points?"
0,该酒店是携程所介绍的最差的，早饭很差，一大群服务员坐在一旁的挖鼻屎、化妆、大声说话，恶心！补充点评2006年11月6日：大房间里没有小床，设施简单。,"The hotel is the worst introduced by Ctrip. Breakfast is very poor. A large group of waiters sit on the side to dig, make up, make makeup, speak loudly, and disgust!Supplementary comment on November 6, 2006: There are no small beds in the big room, and the facilities are simple."

0,首先感谢携程网的协助，对携程网此次服务感到满意。入住经贸宾馆，首先感觉房间空间太小，双人商务标准间达不到应有标准，倒像单间面积；房间内卫生状况不佳，地面有明显得泥灰等，卫生间门前脚踏垫脏污；室内座椅感觉特脏，不愿落座。,"First of all, thanks to Ctrip.com for his assistance to be satisfied with Ctrip.com's service.Attacking to the Economic and Trade Hotel, first feel that the room space is too small, and the two -person business standard room does not meet the standards, like a single room area; the sanitary condition in the room is not good, the ground is obviously muddy and gray, etc.; Indoor seats feel dirty and do not want to sit."

0,这是我住过的最差的酒店。入住的时候房卡搞错，明明只要440（这个价格我也就不说了，根本不值）的房费，居然要3倍的押金。做了预授权然后居然结帐的时候说没做，要我付现，后来才翻出单据说没看到。结帐用了20分钟，而且就我一个在结帐。索要发票说只有整数（和餐馆的一样，而没有机打的）而不给小额。最后很不情愿地多给了些（也不是我想要的）房间就更一无是处，没网络，小姐电话每半小时响一次，根本不让你睡觉（后来我拔了电话线），暖气烧到29度，而且没法调节，在外面－22度的情况下开了窗还是热。真想不通携程怎么能推荐这样的酒店，满洲里酒店其实不少。我是携程的钻石会员，但是下次去满洲里我再也不会订携程的酒店了！千万别住！！！！！！！！！！,"This is the worst hotel I have lived.When checking in, the room card is wrong.

The room was even more useless. There was no network. The lady's phone rang every half an hour and did not let you sleep (later I unplugged the phone line), the heating was burned until the heating was burned to29 degrees, and it cannot be adjusted. It is still hot when it is opened at -22 degrees outside.I really can't figure out how to recommend such a hotel.

0,很旧的酒店，房间里又脏又旧，不过床铺的干净程度还算可以接受。电视遥控器也不好用，窗户完全不可以打开，外面贴着不知道什么广告。到晚上11点回来，已经不知道前台服务员去了哪里？无奈找到其他服务员，对前台告诉早上6：00叫早，前台也已经确认，结果是幸亏自己的手机有闹钟功能，不然一定赶不上飞机。早上结账时，告诉入住2位客人，需要另外交2元的城市建设费（好像是这个费用，甘肃省要求的）。在甘肃的其他酒店入住时，其他的酒店都自己承担的，钱虽然不多，不过可以反映酒店的服务水平。唯一的好处就是这个酒店可以提供免费接机服务，不过来接的车子也应该不是酒店的车子，一路上一直询问可否自己租他的车子。不过师傅倒是态度挺憨厚的。这样小的城市，这样的服务水平也就不足为奇了！！,"The old hotel is dirty and old in the room, but the cleanliness of the bed is acceptable.The TV remote control is not easy to use, the windows cannot be opened at all, and the advertisement is not known to the outside.Back at 11 pm, I don't know where the front desk waiter has gone?I helplessly find other waiters.

0,订的一般标准间￥228的，在前台等了十来分钟开好了房间，刚进了房间就被告知开错了，说开成了￥228的（其实就比￥228的多两瓶水，两小袋饼干），紧接着就被服务员赶（是赶，没错）出了房间，问新开的房间呢，服务员一脸的不快，说在开等会送来，又过了十来分钟服务员才又拿了房卡，房间设施吧感觉一般，达不到三星的标准吧，不及我在观音桥住得一些商务酒店，价格还能便宜一些。,"The general standard room is ￥ 228. After waiting for ten minutes in the front desk, the room was opened. As soon as I entered the room, I was told that I was wrong., Two small bag biscuits), then was driven by the waiter (rushing, yes) out of the room, asking the newly opened room, the waiter was unhappy, saying that he would send it to ten minutes.The waiter took the room card again. The room facilities felt average. It could not meet the standards of Samsung. It was not as good as I lived in some business hotels at Guanyinqiao. The price was cheaper."
0,"酒店服务人员态度不是很好,卫生一般,也因为价格不贵,所以如果下次有机会可能还会入住.","The hotel service staff is not very good, hygienic, and because the price is not expensive, if there is a chance next time, they may still stay."
0,高级大床房没看到一点高级的地方。床垫弹簧很明显的能感觉到，房间没有大顶灯只靠2个昏暗的床头灯照明，饮水壶和茶杯都放在卫生间里很是让人不舒服，茶杯里的茶垢也不知道是哪天留下的，浴巾很旧颜色看上去都不忍目睹，第二天退房时告诉我房间3个枕套及床单上有污物，和服务员一起重回房间他们拉开了房间的窗帘，这才看到枕套和床单上那些黑色的斑斑点点将我恶心到死。竟然说是我们弄的，晚上入住的时候没有顶灯根本看不清楚房间状况，白天这一看全是起鸡皮疙瘩，还说是我们弄脏的要赔偿，我反问他们你们收拾房间也看到了，我在房间里留下的垃圾中是否有能够造成这种污染的物品，他们也没法回答了。最后虽然是没有让我赔偿，但是还是说是我们弄脏的让人气愤不已。以后不会选择汉庭入住了。宾馆反馈2008年5月30日：首先非常感谢客人的入住，对于在我店不愉快的经历，我深表歉意！说明一下：一根弹簧的床垫一直是我们汉庭酒店的特色，已得到很多客人的肯定，但是每位客人的需求不一样，希望客人能理解。房间的灯光我们也是特别设计的，为的是能给客人提供一个温馨的睡眠环境，这个不用再做说明了。至于客人反映的三个枕套和床单是有污渍，经我酒店查实污渍是很明显的头发挑染的红色掉色。在这里我也不想多做解释是谁的责任。考虑到客人的心理，在礼貌提出赔偿未果的情况下，我店做了报废处理。我们的宗旨：服务第一！希望客人做出客观评价，也希望更多地客人对我店监督指导。谢谢！,"I didn't see a high -end place in the high -end large bed room.The mattress spring is clearly felt that there is no big roof light in the room only relying on 2 dim bed head lights. The drinking kettles and tea cups are uncomfortable in the bathroom.Somedies left, the bath towels can't bear to see the old colors. When I check out the room the next day, I told me that there were dirt on the three pillowcases and sheets in the room, and they returned to the room with the waiter.I saw the black spots on the pillowcase and the sheets who were disgusting to death.It was said that we did it. When we stayed at night, I could n’t see the situation of the room at all. During the day, it was a goosebump. It was said that we had to compensate for it. I asked them that you can clean up the room.Whether there is an item that can cause such pollution in the garbage I left in the room, they can't answer it.In the end, although I did not make me compensation, it was very angry that we were so angry.In the future, you won't choose to stay in Han Ting.Hotel feedback on May 30, 2008: First of all, thank you for your stay. I apologize for my unpleasant experience in my store!Explain: The mattress of a spring has always been the characteristic of our Hanting Hotel. It has been affirmed by many guests, but the needs of each guest are different. I hope the guests can understand.We are also specially designed in the lights of the room to provide guests with a warm sleep environment.As for the three pillowcases and sheets reflected by the guests are stains, the stains that the stains that have been found out by our hotel are obvious red red color loss.Here I don't want to explain more about who is the responsibility.Considering the psychology of the guests, in the case of politely put forward compensation, my store was scrapped.Our purpose: service first!It is hoped that guests will make objective evaluations, and more guests also hope that more guests will supervise and guide our store.Thanks!"
0,很破的酒店，根本不陪挂牌四星的标准，顶多就是一个2星还勉强。酒店就是一个巨大的娱乐场所，里面夜总会，桑拿应用尽有，晚上骚扰电话一个接一个。房间装修很老，电视竟然不看了。更搞笑的是，桌子上虽然有网线，但是没有插座，感情大家的笔记本都不需要充电了么。,"A very broken hotel, the standard of not staying with the four -star, at most is a 2 -star and barely.The hotel is a huge entertainment venue. The nightclub inside, the sauna is available, and the harassment calls at night.The room decoration is very old, and the TV is not watched.What's even more funny is that although there are network cables on the table, there are no sockets, and the emotional everyone's notebook does not need to be charged."
0,"就值5元的浴盐瓶要赔40元,这不是主要的,最主要的是质量差的东西能伤人,我打开没用力就破,我可不是什么大力士",The bath salt bottle with 5 yuan is to pay 40 yuan. This is not the main thing. The main thing is that the poor quality things can hurt people. I will break it if I open it. I am not a great power.
0,"给朋友定了该酒店,价格比以前高出了很多.这且不说.转天朋友结帐,前台因为染了一块毛巾和床单的说法要求赔偿110元.朋友很不开心,说就是喝你们冰箱可乐时候喷出来一些.而且110买你5套也够了.结果我要求前台把经理找来,一个小伙子说他就是.朋友说你们四星这么做有点过火.后来我要求那个小伙子带我去房间看一下有没有污染,到什么程度.于是他就一起去了,床单的一大片我表示怀疑是否是朋友染的.于是在我拉掉床单的一刹那,令人惊讶的事情发生了,在下面棉单上面,竟然有一女人例假的血迹.当然就想吐,那血还好象是近期的.朋友一看就急了,在这床上睡一晚是多么让人恶心.我相信酒店也完全能检查出来有,根本没有换,或者简单洗完就铺上了.所以,请大家今后住这个酒店一定好好检查检查.(酒店最终解决是半价,但是远远无法消除这种失望,决心不再入住).补充点评2007年2月3日：如果床单上发现有血迹,这在国外,甚至国内的4,5星酒店绝对是无法容忍的事情.酒店不是简单的打着折就能摆平的事情.","I set the hotel for my friends, and the price is much higher than before. This is not to say. Turn to the sky to check out. The front desk is required to compensate for 110 yuan because of a towel and sheets.It was sprayed out of the refrigerator. And 110 bought you 5 sets is enough. As a result, I asked the front desk to find the manager at the front desk. A young man said that he was. Friends said that you four stars were a bit too hot. LaterSee if there is pollution, to what extent. So he went together, and I doubted whether I was dyed with a friend. So at the moment when I pulled the sheets, the surprising thing happened, below below, below below.On the cotton list, there was a woman's blood stains. Of course, I wanted to vomit, the blood seemed to be recently. My friend was anxious at a glance, how disgusting it was to sleep in this bed.Check it out, do n’t change it at all, or it will be paved after simply washing. So, please stay in this hotel in the future.) Supplementary reviews February 3, 2007: If there are blood on the sheets, this is definitely inconvenient to tolerate the 4,5 -star hotels abroad."
0,这个饭店比较老旧、像20年前的饭店，实在不是一个好的住宿选择。服务人员也没有饭店服务观念。（问什么都不知道）唯一好处就是步行街在旁边，方便逛街。另一个不知是不是优点或内部管理不良？携程预订，入住时不用收押金、也不用信用卡预授权，退房再付钱，对客人的信用程度很高，饭店界少见！,"This restaurant is older and like a restaurant like 20 years ago. It is really not a good accommodation choice.The service staff does not have the concept of hotel service.(I don't know anything.) The only advantage is that the pedestrian street is beside it, which is convenient for shopping.I wonder if it is advantage or internal management?Ctrip booking does not need to collect deposits or credit cards during check -in, paying out for check -up, paying out the home, high degree of credit to guests, rare in the hotel industry!"
0,这家如家实在是太差了，定了两个房间，一个还没有窗户，一个所谓的商务大床房，结果小的不能再小。希望大家入住以前一定要好好看看我们住过的人的评价，真的觉得很差，我也是因为打电话预定，没看到以前住过的朋友的评价才住进来的，入住的时候已经10点多了，结果还等了20分钟才办好checkin，勉强住了一天，第二天一早就退房了。建议大家不要住。,"This family is too bad. I set up two rooms, one without a window, a so -called large business bed room, but the result cannot be small.I hope that before you stay in, you must take a good look at the evaluation of the people we have lived. I really feel bad. I also lived because I called the evaluation of friends who had lived before.After more, I waited for 20 minutes before I finished Checkin. I barely lived for a day.It is recommended that you do not live."
0,真算不上四星级酒店！不过在什邡没有什么象样的酒店了，没得选择！郁闷！,"It's really not a four -star hotel!But there is no hotel in Shifang, no choice!depressed!"
0,经不住携程这么多好评的诱惑，本来不打算再来住的，决定再体验一次，以决定取舍，果然这次基本没再让我失望。上次住的358元精致客房，这次住的456元的行政套房，唉！一分钱一分货啊。卫生还可以做得再好一些－－床单上有多处黑迹。细节还可以再注意一下－－餐券上怎么没有时间？还得再打电话去问；卫生间排气扇噪音太大了，感觉跟在飞机上一样；装修用了太多玻璃，有点眼花缭乱，卫生间应该用不透明的门。2007年11月15日点评的时候曾经提到“君临天下”，后来还真去住过一次，感觉就仨字－－“很失望”，浪费了这么高的大楼和这个好名了，装修太业余，没档次，服务太差，11.18去住，居然没有取暖措施，也不告知客人，害得我空开了一宿空调，直接冻感冒了，在前台结账的时候，发现服务员也感冒了，症状很明显了，还“带病坚持工作”－－不想想对面的客户什么感受？正赶上发票用完了，站那儿干等着服务员用了五分多钟才换上新发票，自始至终就没一句表示歉意的话。补充点评2008年2月29日：不好意思，2分点评是给“君临天下”的，给宏裕4.2分吧。,"I ca n’t stand the temptation of Ctrip so much praise. I did n’t plan to live again, and decided to experience it again to decide to choose. Sure enough, I did not disappoint me this time.The 358 yuan exquisite room I lived last time, the administrative suite of 456 yuan this time, oh!One penny and one penny.Hygiene can be done better -there are many black traces on the sheets.You can also pay attention to the details -why don't you have time on the meal coupon?I have to call again; the bathroom exhaust fan is too noisy, and it feels the same as on the plane; too many glass is used in the decoration, which is a bit dazzling. The bathroom should use opaque doors.When the review on November 15, 2007, I mentioned ""Junjun to the World"". Later, I really lived once, and I felt like ""very disappointed"".I am amateur, no grade, the service is too bad, live at 11.18, there is no heating measures, and I do n’t tell the guests. It hurts me to open an air conditioner and freeze a cold. When I checked at the front desk, I found that the waiter had a cold.The symptoms are obvious, and they are ""persistent work with the disease"" -the don't want to think about what the customer feels on the opposite side?It was finishing the invoice, and the station was waiting for the waiter for five minutes to replace the new invoice. From beginning to end, there was no apology.Supplementary comment on February 29, 2008: Sorry, 2 points comments are given to ""Junjun World"", and Hongyu is 4.2 points."
0,1、隔音很差！走廊外面有任何动静都一清二楚，问题是你就不用休息了！2、所有的毛巾都有一股烟味！不知道为什么？这是第三次住了，每次都是如此。而且毛巾还硬得出奇。宾馆反馈2008年4月12日：感谢您的点评，酒店的隔音通过您的点评已经改善，毛巾的洗剂方式已经进行调整，在清洗时通过增加柔软剂，已改变毛巾的柔软程度.,"1. The sound insulation is poor!There is any movement outside the corridor, and the problem is that you don't need to rest!2. All towels have a smell of smoke!do not know why?This is the third time, and this is the case every time.And the towels are still surprising.Hotel feedback on April 12, 2008: Thank you for your review. The sound insulation of the hotel has been improved through your reviews, and the method of washing agent of the towel has been adjusted. When cleaning, the soft agent has changed the softness of the towel."
0,很小的一个酒店，在小区里，去马路大约要走2-3分钟，酒店淋浴水比较小，特别不满意的是竟然不能延迟至2点退房，只能到12点半，否则要加收半天房费，在外吃饭或中午要小休一会的朋友要注意了。现在的酒店不延迟退房的还没遇到，这是我遇到的第一家。,"A very small hotel, in the community, it takes about 2-3 minutes to go to the road. The hotel's shower water is relatively small. It is particularly unsatisfactory that it cannot be delayed to 2 o'clock.Receive friends for a half -day room, and friends who eat or take a break at noon should pay attention.The hotel has not been delayed, I haven't encountered it yet, this is the first one I encountered."
0,对了，前面的说插钥匙的那东西要拍一下才起作用不新鲜，我每次都是这么做的，最搞笑的是我把卡拔下来了，电还是没有断。楼后面正在施工，推土机，打桩机，汽车，还有工人喊叫声，现场感太强了！夜里也不休息。前台的小组的确是一个个哭丧着脸，跟人家欠她八百吊一样给大堂副理在不同时段打了Ｎ次电话，从来就没人接过．,"By the way, the previous thing to insert the key should be taken to play a role. I do this every time. The most funny thing is that I pump out the card and the electricity is still not broken.Behind the building is under construction, bulldozer, pile driver, car, and workers shouted. The sense of scene is too strong!No rest at night.The group in the front desk was indeed crying one by one. Like the people owed her 800 hanging, the deputy manager of the lobby made a N -call at different times, and no one has ever received it."
0,"简直太差了,劝大家千万别去上这个当！！！我住的是豪华标间5503和6603都住过，主要是为了能上网，奇了怪了，商务酒店上网还要10块钱/天，交了10块钱，那网速快得简直像拔号，太刺激了！房间里不是中央空调，挂了一个海尔的空调，一口凉气根本没作用，还不停的发出怪怪动静。洗手间是那种独立的淋浴房，可居然在两块玻璃中间没有一个隔的东西，一洗澡就水漫金山，整个卫生间地上到处是水（好像招待所都是这样的）。我发现手纸用完了，给客房中心找了N个电话让他们送，他们说很快就给送来，送了一晚上也没送来。他们好像从不给客人房卡外面的欢迎卡，只给一张IC卡，可能很多客人记不清自已的房间号，另外房间号排得也很弱智，有503房间，还有5503房间，导致我的房间每天都被别人用IC卡捅N次，不管你是早中晚还是你睡得迷迷糊糊。最可怕的是我离开前的那天晚上，有客人用IC卡捅我的门捅不开，就敲门，用脚踹。服务员在半夜三点钟的时候挨着门的开，居然打开了我的门，我大喝：干什么！才说了一句：对不起先生，打搅了！","It's so bad, I advise everyone not to go to this!IntersectionIntersectionI live in the luxury standard room 5503 and 6603, mainly to be able to access the Internet. It is strange. The business hotel will cost 10 yuan/day to pay 10 yuan.No., too exciting!The room was not a central air conditioner. A Haier's air conditioner was hung. A bite of cooling was no effect at all, and he kept making strange movements.The toilet is the kind of independent shower room, but there is nothing separated between the two pieces of glass. When you take a bath, the water is golden mountains.I found that the hand paper was used up, and I found n calls to the guest room center for them to send them. They said that they would be sent soon, and they were not delivered for one night.They seem to never give the guest room card outside the welcome card, only give one IC card. Maybe many guests can not remember their room number. In addition, the room number is also very mentally handicapped.My room is pinnated by others with an IC card every day. Whether you sleep in the morning, middle or evening or you sleep confused.The most terrible thing is that the night before I left, some guests knocked on the door and kicked with my feet with the IC card.The waiter opened next to the door at three o'clock in the middle of the night, and I opened my door. I drank: What do you do!I said: Sorry, sorry, disturb!"
0,这家酒店简直就是招待所，房间一股霉味，洗澡热水要先开10分钟，浴缸小的可怜，房间的设施简陋，洗澡水从浴缸直接流出，经过地面到下水道，卫生间满地都是水，马桶的盖板比马桶小一圈。不知道为什么携程网会和这种垃圾酒店签协议。打死我都不会去住第二次了，总结：差!差!差!,"This hotel is simply a guest house. The room has a moldy smell. Bathing hot water should be opened for 10 minutes first. The bathtub is small and poor. The facilities in the room are simple.The cover of the toilet is a lap than the toilet.I don't know why Ctrip signed an agreement with this garbage hotel.I will not live for the second time, summary: Poor! Poor! Poor!"
0,房间设施相当差，马桶圈居然小了一大圈，浴缸的水直接排到卫生间的下水道，洗个澡弄的卫生间里全是水，门卡居然也没有，说是给交警大队队长了，进出得要服务员开门。对面就是火车站，以后绝对不能找火车站附近的酒店，太坑了！,"The room facilities are quite poor. The toilet ring is actually a large circle. The water of the bathtub is directly discharged to the sewer in the toilet. The bathrooms that have been taken are full of water, and the door card is not.The waiter has to open the door.The opposite is the railway station. You must not find a hotel near the railway station in the future."
0,第一：从预订看酒店和携程。作为携程的钻石客户，一直以来对预订效率和正确率都比较满意，但本次预订上海世茂皇家艾美酒店感到非常气愤、烦人！由于酒店方出台新的房价政策（连住4晚以上房价），否认本人已确认的订单（连住2晚以上房价），前后和携程交涉不下20次才重新恢复原订单的有效性。虽然此事已得到解决，但反映两个重要问题：一是上海世茂皇家艾美酒店经营不诚信，在携程客服一再确认之下才承认修改过房价政策和同意按照原订单标准收费；二是携程处理客户问题的机制反映迟钝，并有不负责任的表现。第二：从入住感受看酒店。1、酒店地理位置相当优越，出门就是南京路步行街，周边都是中、西式餐饮店，这是我看到的唯一优势。2、酒店坐落的大楼设计很独特，成三角形，酒店大堂位于11楼，以下都是商场，电梯很多却都有指定的起始和到达楼层，从1楼（首层）上有直达电梯，但对于要办登记入住的客人都须先到（L层）办理好手续再转乘，下楼更麻烦，所有都得先到（L层）再转乘。反正住这几酒店三天就是在电梯里转来转去，绝对浪费时间！商务客人勿住！2、15楼行政楼层室内结构和布局很别扭，洗脸台在卫生间外使用时难免有水溅在地上很滑，没有悬挂毛巾的地方，这些都能忍受，但床头的位置正对着门，中间只有一个屏风，晚上象躺在门口睡，床垫更是难受！太高太软，睡了第二天起来全身痛！更让人难以忍受的是这个酒店的被子竟然没套被单，而是有一条床单隔着被子，睡到半夜全部弄得乱七八糟！！3、房间有很多瓦数很高的灯，研究了很久才知道很多灯都串联在一起，只能同时开启和关闭，绝对浪费能源！这就是我住过的房价两千七百多的所谓的皇家行政房，实在是一家性价比极端差的酒店，这样的酒店以后就是免费也不会再住，因为从预订到入住只有很受气、超麻烦、不舒服、不值得的感觉。望后来者三思！,"First: Look at the hotel and Ctrip from booking.As Ctrip's diamond customers, they have always been satisfied with the efficiency and accuracy of booking, but this time I booked the Royal Hotel in Shanghai Shimao, I feel very angry and annoying!As the hotel party issued a new housing price policy (more than 4 nights of housing prices), he denied the order that I had confirmed (more than 2 nights of housing prices), and re -recovered the effectiveness of the original order with the previous negotiations for less than 20 times.Although this incident has been resolved, it reflects two important issues: First, the Royal Emmi Hotel in Shimao is uncomfortable in business. Under the Ctrip customer service repeatedly confirmed, he admits to the amendment of the house price policy and agree to charge in accordance with the original order standard; the second is Ctrip.The mechanism of dealing with customer issues is slow and irresponsible.Second: Look at the hotel from the experience of staying.1. The hotel's geographical location is quite superior. Going out is Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street, and the surroundings are all Chinese and Western -style restaurants. This is the only advantage I saw.2. The building of the hotel is very unique. It is a triangle. The hotel lobby is located on the 11th floor. The following are shopping malls. Many elevators have designated starts and reached the floor.For customers who want to register, they must go to (L layer) to go through the procedures before transferring, and it is more troublesome to go downstairs.Anyway, staying in these hotels for three days, turning around in the elevator, absolutely waste of time!Do not live in business guests!2. The indoor structure and layout of the administrative floor on the 15th floor are very awkward. When the face washing table was used outside the bathroom, it was inevitable that water splashed on the ground and there was no place to hang towels.There is only one screen in the middle. At night, I was lying at the door and sleeping, and the mattress was even more uncomfortable!It's too high and soft, and the whole body hurts the next day!What is even more unbearable is that the quilt of this hotel did not have a quilt, but a sheets were separated by the quilt, and they were all messy until the middle of the night!Intersection3. There are many tall lights in the room. After studying for a long time, I know that many lights are connected in series. It can only be turned on and closed at the same time, absolutely waste of energy!This is the so -called royal administrative house with more than 2,700 houses I have lived in. It is really a hotel with extremely poor cost -effectiveness. Such a hotel will not live for free in the future, because from booking to check -in.Trouble, uncomfortable, not worthwhile.Hope the latecomers think twice!"

0,因为去长寿路办事，于是订了这个酒店，但却是我在上海住过的最差劲的酒店！酒店是单栋建筑，周边没有绿化等任何美化的环境。门口叫车超级难，因为上海的司机不知为什么在这个酒店附近都不停车，只有当有乘客正好在这个位置下车时才能叫到，在门口吹风真是冷死冻死！大堂在六楼，楼下没有停车场，地下室停车场很小，高级大床间很小又不方正，是个三角形的结构，床对着门，躺在床上有一种很不安全的感觉，因为一开门就看到人，难道携程预订的就只能排这种房间？！房间的设施设备勉强三星，将近六百块一晚真的很划不来，下次绝对不会再踏入这个酒店，也会和朋友说到上海千万不要住这个酒店，性价比太低了！！！,"Because I went to Changshou Road, I booked this hotel, but it was the worst hotel I have lived in Shanghai!The hotel is a single building, and there is no beautification environment such as greening around.It is super difficult to call a car at the door, because the driver of Shanghai does not know why there is no parking near this hotel. Only when a passenger just gets off at this location, it can be called. The blowing off at the door is really frozen to death!The lobby is on the sixth floor. There is no parking lot downstairs. The basement parking lot is very small. The high -end large bed is small and unconventional. It is a triangular structure.

0,三亚我去过几次了，前几次是公司组织的，这次和老婆、老妈一起去大东海，一来度假，二来拍婚纱照。我们选择是三亚明珠海景酒店，大东海的分光不如亚龙湾，明珠海景酒店的设施服务更加让人失望，甚至令人气愤。我们入住的是3218、3219两个房间，房间很小，很旧。白天逛了逛海滩，吃了海鲜，晚上回来睡觉，关上门窗听到一些似乎是海浪的声音，就没太注意，到了晚上12点多，声音越来越大，就像飞机的轰鸣声，让人无法入眠。第二天老妈说声音吵的她脑袋疼，我发现是酒店的大锅炉在作怪，这时候我做了一个错误的决定――忍耐！结果连续三晚都是如此，半夜吵得人抓狂，第四天晚上实在睡不着，凌晨5点多的时候，让他们值班经理来看，他们临时关了锅炉，可是早上8点多又开了，实在让人气愤，我就找他们大堂副理，一个姓李的女士交涉，她反复推托，一直拖到12点多，最后我愤怒了，她让他们经历一个姓周的女士跟我谈，结果一点补偿措施都没有，态度相当蛮恨，我只好投诉12315，结果12315的人沆瀣一气，让我去投诉环保部门，并且说好40分钟到现场，也一拖再拖，由于时间限制，我只好非常失望的离开了这家酒店。这次痛苦的旅行，让我记住了这家垃圾酒店――三亚明珠酒店！特别是那个林女士、周女士的店大欺客的嘴脸！补充点评2008年1月3日：广大驴友如果一定要入住该酒店，最好实地考察一下房间的噪音，应该不会低于60分贝。,"I have been to Sanya a few times. I was organized by the company a few times. This time, I went to the Dadonghai with my wife and mother.We chose to be the Zhuhai Scenic Hotel in Sanya. The spanning of the Dadonghai is not as good as the Yalong Bay. The facilities and services of the Pearl Sea View Hotel are even more disappointing and even angry.We stayed in the two rooms of 3218 and 3219. The rooms were small and old.I wandered around the beach during the day, ate seafood, returned to sleep at night, closed the door and window to hear some sounds that seemed to be a waves, so I didn't pay much attention. At 12 o'clock in the evening, the sound became louder.People cannot fall asleep.The next day, my mother said that she was noisy in her head. I found that the big boiler of the hotel was making a strange. At this time, I made a wrong decision -patience!As a result, it was the case for three consecutive nights. It was crazy in the middle of the night. The fourth night could not sleep. At more than 5 am, let them watch the manager on duty.It was really angry, so I asked their deputy manager of the lobby. A lady named Li negotiated. She repeatedly pushed and dragged to more than 12 o'clock. In the end, I was angry. She asked them to go through a lady named Zhou.As a result, there was no compensation measures at all, and the attitude was quite hate. I had to complain 12315. As a result, the people of 12315 were angry. Let me complain to the environmental protection department, and said that it was 40 minutes to the scene and dragged it again.I had to leave the hotel very disappointed.This painful trip made me remember this garbage hotel -Sanya Bingsu Hotel!Especially the face of Ms. Lin and Ms. Zhou's shop!Supplementary comment on January 3, 2008: If the majority of donkey friends must stay in the hotel, it is best to check the noise of the room on the spot. It should not be less than 60 decibels."
0,我们要了两间标准大床房在9楼，每间418元，入住时发现房间设施极差，家具桌椅好像学校里学生用旧了换下来的，破烂不堪，类似90年代的招待所，想想反正只住一晚，忍了吧，晚饭后我们去了另一间房间串门，发现房间装修完全是另外一个级别，感觉房间标准有3星半，一下子气就涌上来了，向总台交涉，更让人气愤的是总台对我们提出换房或打折的要求蛮横拒绝，反而出口伤人，还要我们在这半夜近12点的时候退房，把我们扫地出门，让我们住马路去！在21世纪能碰到这种服务态度，也不知哪根香烧错了。斗争了近1个小时，最后我们只好以投诉旅游局相胁，10分钟后，对方请我们住进了以4星标准装修的4楼房间。第二天早上，发现车胎上被扎了3个钉子，轮胎全瘪了，除了宾馆报复外，不晓得在这人生地不熟的地方我会有什么仇家？！建议：5楼以上是加层建筑，里面有大半房间都是简单装修，尽量要求给你下面楼层的房间。,"We asked for two standard large bed rooms on the 9th floor, 418 yuan each. When I stayed, I found that the room facilities were very poor. The furniture tables and chairs seemed to be used in the school to replace them.I want to live only one night anyway, I can bear it. After dinner, we went to another room for the door and found that the room decoration was completely another level. I felt that the room standard was 3 stars and a half stars.What is even more angry is that the main station refused to change the house or discount on us, but exported to hurt people. We also had to check out at the night of 12 o'clock in the middle of the night, sweep us out of the ground, and let us live on the road!In the 21st century, I could encounter this attitude of service, and I do n’t know which incense was wrong.After nearly an hour, we had to threaten the Tourism Bureau in the end. After 10 minutes, the other party asked us to live in the 4th floor room renovated at 4 stars.The next morning, I found that there were three nails on the tires, and the tires were all stunned. Except for the hotel's retaliation, I don't know what the enemy would I have in the place where I was unfamiliar?IntersectionSuggestion: above the 5th floor is an additional building. Most of the rooms are simple decoration. Try to give you the room on the floor below."
0,海口的酒店特别便宜，这家也不例外。不过实际情况应该和价钱成正比，酒店设施比较旧，游泳池是户外的，特别小。下次不会再住了,"The hotel in Haikou is particularly cheap, and this one is no exception.However, the actual situation should be directly proportional to the price. The hotel facilities are relatively old. The swimming pool is outdoors and particularly small.I won't live again next time"
0,差劲，并没有特殊的，我订了2天的房，到第三天续房要换房，结果忘了拿抽屉里的DV机，第二天，下午电话给客房中心，说给回复情况，结果未给回复；打给大堂值班经理投诉并要求协助；投诉理由：1.不知四还是五星的宾馆换房怎么无人及时发现客人遗留物品，及及时通知客人。她的理由是换房与退房不同，房间第二天早上才有服务员进去打扫的。。。。总之，什么凯莱，其实也是很差的，不要对他寄望什么。,"I was bad, there was no special. I had a room for 2 days. On the third day, I had to change the room to the room. As a result, I forgot to take the DV machine in the drawer. The next day, the phone to the room center for the afternoon, and the reply to the situation.The results were not given to the reply; the manager of the lobby duty complained and asked for assistance; the reason for the complaint: 1. I do n’t know how the four or five -star hotel changes how no one finds the items left by the guests in time, and the guests inform the guests in time.Her reason is that the room is different from the check -out. The room did not go in the room the next morning to clean it.EssenceEssenceEssenceIn short, what Kaile is actually very bad, don't expect anything to him."
0,"服务很差,房间供暖不足。换啦两次房间才行。态度恶劣。新房间床上有别人的毛发。叫服务员换还很不高兴。",The service is poor and the room heating is insufficient.Change the room twice.have a bad attitude.There are other people's hair on the new room bed.The waiter was very unhappy.

0,这次住的丽晶，实在是令人气愤。酒店浴室没有防滑垫，铺了个毛巾在地上冲凉。怎奈毛巾太小，还是摔倒。3个牙齿摔没了。包括两个门牙，其中一个要拔掉。之后发生的事情更是让我对这个所谓在当地的四星级酒店太失望了。酒店没有任何一个人在事情发生到现在有个道歉的意思。反而说你自己不小心，拒不做任何有诚意的合理赔偿。携程的沟通也是令人失望。一句“没有办法”，仅此而已。希望准备入住这个酒店的朋友要注意。自己的平安还是很重要的。,"Li Jing, who lives this time, is really angry.There was no non -slip pad in the hotel bathroom, and a towel was spread on the ground.Why is the towel too small and fall.3 teeth fell.Including two front teeth, one of them is unplugged.What happened later made me too disappointed with this so -called local four -star hotel.No one in the hotel has an apology to an apology now.Instead, you are not careful and refuse to make any sincere and reasonable compensation.Ctrip's communication is also disappointing.""No way"", that's all.I hope friends who are ready to stay at this hotel should pay attention.It is still important for your own peace."
0,"酒店服务态度还不错，就是感觉地点比较偏，周围没有什么吃饭的地方。早餐感觉也没有以前好了。宾馆反馈2008年4月5日：酒店离市中心,只有三分钟车程,周围有很多吃饭的地方,欢迎到总台咨询.早餐的品种已调整","The hotel's service attitude is not bad, that is, I feel that the location is relatively biased, and there is no place to eat around.Breakfast feels not as good as before.Hotel feedback on April 5, 2008: The hotel is left in the city center, there are only three minutes drive, and there are many places to eat around. Welcome to consult the main station. The breed of breakfast has been adjusted"
0,"我在网站上预定的是一间大床房,到CHECKIN的时候变成了双人房,虽然后来给我调换了.酒店地理位置不错,门口时高速和轻轨.但酒店的房间整理装修时非常的差,非常的陈旧,完全对不住这个房价!!!!!以后也不会住这个酒店了!","I booked a large bed room on the website. When I checkin, I became a double room. Although I changed me later. The hotel has a good geographical location, high -speed and light rail at the door.Poor, very old, I can't hold this house price at all !!!!! I won't live in this hotel in the future!"
0,酒店设备很陈旧，浴室设备也坏掉，服务也很差。因为到的比较晚，入住已经差不多11点钟了，家里人打电话来酒店，酒店总机也是特别没礼貌的挂电话。因为经常出差，这基本上是住过最差的酒店了。,"The hotel equipment is very old, the bathroom equipment is broken, and the service is poor.Because it was late, it was almost 11 o'clock in check -in. The family called the hotel, and the hotel chief aircraft was also very rudely hung up.Because often traveling, this is basically the worst hotel."
0,这破饭店还敢说是2007年新装修，除了墙纸、窗帘换过了，开关、家具、浴缸、马桶都是旧的，房间里那灯和电视机不知是哪个朝代的，携程该给大家好好把把关。,"This breaking hotel dares to say that it was newly renovated in 2007. Except for wallpaper and curtains, switching, furniture, bathtub, and toilet are old. I do n’t know which dynasty in the room and the TV in the room.Get off."
0,这个酒店可真是太差了~我住的还是行政房呢，空调漏水，声音非常大，地毯很脏，家具很旧然后有蚊子，管客房部要蚊香，告知没有~,"This hotel is so bad ~ I still live in the administrative house. The air conditioner is leaking, the sound is very loud, the carpet is dirty, the furniture is very old and then there are mosquitoes."
0,服务太不好了，晚上房间的蚊子太多了，人性的关怀不好,"The service is too bad, there are too many mosquitoes in the room at night, and the care of human nature is not good."
0,"1、该酒店房间小,我住的标准间很小,很舒服;2、这个酒店是三星级，我认为最多能够上两颗星，属于好一点的招待所；3、价钱贵，周遍环境不好；4、服务员服务质量极次，建议协程取缔该酒店的会员资格，我去有上当的感觉。","1. The hotel room is small, and the standard room I live in is very small and comfortable; 2. This hotel is a three -star level. I think it can be up to two stars, which belongs to a better guest house;Not good; 4. The waiter's service quality is extremely important. It is recommended that the corporate babbles ban the membership qualification of the hotel."
0,位置太难找了，房间设施少，功能单一，作为商务间，没有配备电脑，有点遗憾～！,"The location is too difficult to find, there are few room facilities and single functions. As a business room, there is no computer, it is a bit regrettable ~!"
0,总之一句话，感觉比半年前住的时候糟糕很多，住的豪华商务单间，首先是酒店没收到携程的定单，在前台扯了半天，然后房间的墙壁有裂缝的，门锁是坏的（打到房务中心还没人管），床凳是脏的，去餐厅吃饭介绍的特色菜（如千张包）都是没有的，买单签个房帐要等20分钟的，唉怎么说的，真不知道怎么差别那么大！,"In short, it feels much worse than when I live in half a year ago. The luxury business single room is first, first of all, the hotel did not receive the order of Ctrip, and it was pulled for a long time on the front desk.No one is in charge of the housing center), the bed stool is dirty, and there are no special dishes (such as thousands of bags) introduced to the restaurant to eat. Buying a list of houses should be waited for 20 minutes.I don't know how the difference is so big!"
0,酒店设施不差，只不过由于前身是一家烂尾楼改造的，整体太空旷，而且很多房间没有窗口，预订的时候需要特别注意。所谓的行政房绝对不能够去住，厕所和冲凉房是在一间房子内用玻璃隔开的，洗手盆居然就在床边，匪夷所思的布局，还居然是行政房。服务员素质极差，我通过携程预定，写明两个男人入住，居然只保留了一间单人床的房子，还坚称“携程没有说明要两张床”,"The hotel facilities are not bad, but because the predecessor was transformed by a rotten tail building, the overall space was clever, and many rooms had no windows. You need to pay special attention when reservation.The so -called administrative houses must not be able to live. The toilet and shower house are separated from glass in a house. The washbasin is actually on the bed. The incredible layout is actually an administrative house.The quality of the waiter was extremely poor. I made a storage of the two men through Ctrip, and I only retained a single -person bed house. I insisted that ""Ctrip did not explain two beds"""
0,酒店的房间装修得飞常好，空间也很大，可是我非常不能理解的是，300多一晚的酒店居然房间不提供免费上网。另外，枕巾洗得不干净，说实话下次不考虑住了。,"The hotel's room is well -decorated and the space is very large, but what I can't understand is that the hotel in more than 300 nights does not provide free access to the Internet.In addition, the pillow towel is not cleaned, to be honest, I will not consider living next time."
0,我真的建议所有到成都出差的朋友千万不要入住这家酒店，首先这个酒店的位置实在不好，附近基本上没有什么娱乐，而且因为附近的出租车是属于郊区的，管理非常不严格，如果发现不是本地人就会绕很远的路，我为了离客户的近才住的这家酒店，结果10元的路程，出租车竟然给我绕了30元。最重要的是这个酒店的服务很差，行政房没有行政待遇，checkout时候竟然把免费的服务都算钱了。而且我是洲际的金卡会员，一向比较重视积分的和住宿天数的累计，因为我是携程定的酒店，这家酒店竟然不给我积分，甚至连一个标准的会员入住天数也没有给我累积。同样的在成都总府路附近的洲际下属的总府皇冠酒店，服务和地理环境非常的好，而且明确告诉我虽然是携成订的，但是优悦会的会员卡照样积分，这里说明一下，因为第一天住的不满意，我第二天就搬到那边了。我真心的建议所有有优悦会会员卡的朋友一定不要住这个酒店，要住就去总府皇冠，而且成都很小，高新开发区离市中心也不是很远，住在总府也方便的。,"I really recommend that all friends who go to Chengdu on a business trip do not stay in this hotel. First of all, the location of this hotel is really not good. There is basically no entertainment nearby. Because the nearby taxis belong to the suburbs, the management is very strict.If you find that it is not a local person, you will go far away. In order to stay close to the client's hotel, the room was 10 yuan, and the taxi even gave me 30 yuan.The most important thing is that the service of this hotel is very poor. The administrative house has no administrative treatment. When checkout, the free services are counted as money.And I am a member of the Golden Card in Intercontinental, and I have always attached great importance to the accumulation of points and the number of accommodation days, because I am a hotel in Ctrip. This hotel does not give me points.EssenceSimilarly, the Crown Hotel, the Crown Hotel under the Intercontinental Road near Chengdu, has a very good service and geographical environment, and clearly tells me that although it is made, the membership card of the Youyue Society is scored. HereBecause I was dissatisfied on the first day, I moved there the next day.I sincerely suggest that all friends who have Youyue Club membership cards must not stay in this hotel. If you want to live, you will go to the Crown of the General Palace, and Chengdu is very small. The high -tech development zone is not far from the city center.Essence"
0,"符合美国Motel的风格，严格控制成本。但所有设施过于简陋，且房间霉暗晦涩、睡床糟糕、床单不洁。下次决不再尝试。宾馆反馈2008年7月25日：尊敬的宾客：感谢您入住本酒店，同时也感谢您对我们酒点提出的意见。因为前段时间是苏城的梅雨季节，所以感觉房间有点霉暗晦涩，为客人提供一张舒适干净的床是我们的责任！您的激励会让我们做的更好！酒店将于2008年7月28日更名为星程酒店,并按照星程连锁酒店标准进行了新的装修,对客房及服务进行了全面升级.我们将努力以全新的面貌,赢得您最大的满意,希望您再次入住时会有不一样的体会.","It is in line with the style of American MOTEL and strictly controls costs.However, all facilities are too simple, the room is dark and obscure, the bed is bad, and the sheets are not clean.Never try next time.Hotel feedback on July 25, 2008: Dear guest: Thank you for staying in the hotel, and also thank you for your opinion on our wine.Because some time ago is the rainy season of Sucheng, it feels a bit moldy and obscure, and it is our responsibility to provide guests with a comfortable and clean bed!Your incentive will make us do better!The hotel will be renamed the Star Hotel on July 28, 2008, and a new decoration is made in accordance with the Starbar Chain Hotel Standard.I hope you will have a different experience when you stay again."
0,酒店真的不怎么样，不知道怎么评上四星的。房间又小又旧，早餐也没什么吃的，服务也不好，而且会有骚扰电话,"The hotel is really not very good. I don't know how to comment on the four stars.The room is small and old, the breakfast is not eaten, the service is not good, and there will be harassing calls"

0,该酒店装修比较成旧。我房间的浴室出水很小，洗澡很不方便。,"The hotel's decoration is relatively old.The bathroom in my room is very small, and bathing is very inconvenient."

0,本来想订的不是这家。找酒店时看到这家每条点评都有回馈，觉得服务不错，就订了。但是对于我们自驾又不熟悉苏州的人来说，这个酒店不太好找，我们花了一个多小时打了几次电话才找到。到的时候在下雨，服务生主动拿了2把伞出来接，给我们的第一印象不错。进了房间，才发现房间小的惊人！连衣橱+卫生间+走廊都不知道有没有携程上说的20平方，象我这等还尚算苗条的人转个身都会碰到点东西，可想而知房间小成啥样。房间虽然按我们的要求给了比较安静的，但是窗外就是美食街小饭店的后门，其脏乱差尽收眼底，难怪我母亲怎么也不愿意在那条街吃饭。电视机很小，频道很少，才10几个。有凤凰卫视却没有国内的有线，几乎没啥选择。房间的布置和用品确实还不错，也就这些值这点房价吧。但是第二天却发生让人不愉快的事。我们8点多去餐厅吃早餐，当时连我们一家在内也就7-8个人，早餐的品种本来就不多，倒有5、6个是空的，除了面包、馒头其它的几乎都没了，请服务生加，没有太大反应，很久才加1-2个，继续保持一半品种没有的状况。开始以为是厨房来不及，后来看到倒光的牛奶和橙汁，拿去厨房，拿回来只加了1/4的量，大概只够倒3-4杯的，就觉得这个酒店有点小家子气，因为当时已经有10多人在用餐，而且时间只是他们承诺供应时间的一半！结帐时，检查房间的阿姨跟总台说我们房间有条毛巾搞脏了，洗不掉，总台的意思就要我们赔，开价75。我们房间的毛巾确实在前一天带孩子去苏州乐园玩时掉在地上弄脏了，洗起来麻烦些但绝不是洗不掉。我就问是否已洗过确定洗不掉，回说是；又问，拿什么洗的，回说清水。真是不知道该气还是笑！问那个清洁阿姨为什么不用洗衣粉，居然理直气状地说洗衣房说的，又说洗衣房不在这里，所以没有任何洗涤用品！实在不想和这样脑筋不太清楚的人多说，直接请主管出来拿些厨房的洗洁精，她只随便选了一个脏的地方，加洗洁精搓搓，原来的白色就出来了。就是这样那个主管还说和正常的白色有色差，要报废了，又说洗衣房要加钱等等，看看时间已经耽误了半个多小时，一家人都在等，不想再和他们搞了，就说我们承担洗涤费，那主管居然开出30元的高价，大约等同于5星酒店水洗毛巾的价。想着离开，也不去计较价格了，谁知那主管居然用所谓大度的态度跟总台说，算了就让他们赔30块吧！实在听得人很撮火，一天的好心情就被破坏！看来现在价廉物美这个词是没什么用了。,"This is not this one who wanted to order.When I was looking for a hotel, I saw that each review was given back, and I felt that the service was good, so I booked it.But for our self -driving and not familiar with Suzhou, this hotel is not easy to find. We spent more than an hour and made a phone call to find it.When it was raining, the waiter took the initiative to take two umbrellas to pick it up, which gave us the first impression.After entering the room, I found that the room was amazing!The wardrobe+bathroom+corridor does not know if there are 20 square meters mentioned on Ctrip. People like me who are still slim and turn around will touch something. I can imagine what the room is like.Although the room was quieter according to our requirements, the window was the back door of the food street. It was dirty. No wonder my mother was unwilling to eat on that street.The TV is very small, and the channel is very small, only 10.There are Phoenix Satellite TV but there is no domestic wired, and there is almost no choice.The layout and supplies of the room are really good, just this value of these values.But the next day was unpleasant.We went to the restaurant for breakfast at 8 o'clock at 8 o'clock. At that time, even our family was 7-8 people. There were not many breeds of breakfast. There were 5 or 6 empty ones.Please add the waiter. There is no great response. It is only 1-2 for a long time, and continue to maintain the situation where the variety is not available.I thought it was too late to be in the kitchen. Later, I saw the pouring milk and orange juice. I took it to the kitchen and took it back and added only 1/4 of the amount. It was only 3-4 cups.More than 10 people are dining, and the time is only half of their promised supply time!At the checkout, the aunt who checked the room told the head station that there was a towel in our room dirty, and we couldn't wash it. The meaning of the main station would have to pay, and the price was 75.The towels in our room did drop their children to Suzhou Paradise the day before, and fell to the ground and dirty. It was troublesome to wash but it was by no means ca n’t be washed away.I asked if I had been washed and I could n’t wash it, and I asked; I asked, ask, what was washed, and the water.I don't know if I should be angry or laugh!Asked why the cleaning aunt didn't need to be laundry powder, he said straightforwardly what the laundry room said, and also said that the laundry room was not here, so there was no washing item!I really do n’t want to say more with such people who are not very clear, and ask the supervisor to get out of the kitchen's detergent. She only chose a dirty place, and rubbed it. The original white came out.That's how the supervisor also said that it was different from the normal white color difference. It was scrapped, and said that the laundry room had to be added to money, etc. It has been delayed for more than half an hour. The family is waiting.To say that we bear the washing fee, the supervisor actually paid a high price of 30 yuan, which was about the price of washing towels at the 5 -star hotel.Thinking about leaving, I don't care about the price. Who knows that the supervisor actually told the head station with the so -called generous attitude, and let them pay 30 yuan!It is really very angry, and the good mood of a day is destroyed!It seems that the word is cheap now. This is useless."

A staff member named Yang Zhiwu at the front desk was very bad. He shouted at me and said that I was out of time. I also said that the computer system was automatic.long time.I told him about 3 minutes, and the tenants next to him couldn't see, saying, ""It's okay after 3 minutes.""But his attitude is still as tough and bad. I have never seen the hotel's service attitude at the front desk. Then I immediately called 12315 complaints. After registering the matter, 12315 asked him to answer the phone and say a few words, ""He was not 3 minutes late, it was 5 minutes late. Now their clock shows that it is 12:08.

0,知道酒店房间小，但没想到这么小，转身都困难；知道酒店房间吵，但没想到这么吵，除了自己的呼噜声，什么声音都能听到；知道酒店服务差，但没想到这么差，服务员说话的感觉和吵架没啥区别；总之，相同价格的酒店还有很多，其他同类酒店的设备和服务比汉普顿好的多了，以后实在不会选择这汉普顿了。。。。。。国内的很多招待所的质量估计都要比它好很多。。。。。。,"Knowing that the hotel room is small, but I didn't expect it to be so small, it was difficult to turn around; I knew the hotel room was noisy, but I didn't expect so noisy. I could hear any sound except my own snoring sound.There is no difference between the waiter's talking and quarrel; in short, there are many hotels at the same price.

0,环境不怎样，住了一天就换了！性价比不高，服务有待改进！,"The environment is not good, I will change it for a day!The cost performance is not high, and the service needs to be improved!"
0,宾馆的周边环境比较好，只是隔墙有个大型公交停车场，有点吵。可能这宾馆有很多长租的客人，很多房间的门上都粘了纸信箱，感觉有点怪怪的。房间的装修很旧，没有连锁宾馆的干净。卫生间洗澡房地上的去水堵的很严重。总的来说对这宾馆的印象不太好。,"The surrounding environment of the hotel is better, but there is a large bus parking lot on the partition wall, which is a bit noisy.Maybe there are many long -term rental guests in this hotel, and many rooms are sticking to the door of the door, which feels a bit weird.The decoration of the room is very old, and there is no cleanliness of the chain hotel.The water removal of the bathroom in the bathroom is very serious.In general, the impression of this hotel is not very good."
0,比起其它的汉庭这家的房间特别小，内部物品的摆放因而很勉强很别扭，住起来不太方便。但据服务人员说由于这家的地理位置好价格还比别家高了近100块钱。地理位置方面其实也没有觉得特别好，在陕西南路下地铁以后还要步行15分钟的样子，如果行李多这段距离其实真的不短！总体来说性价比不太让人满意。,"Compared with other Hanting's room, the room is very small, so the placement of internal items is barely awkward, and it is not convenient to live.However, according to the service staff, the price of this family is nearly 100 yuan higher than that of other homes.In terms of geographical location, I didn't feel particularly good. After the subway under the southbound of Shaanxi, it would have to walk for 15 minutes. If the distance between the luggage is really not short!Generally speaking, the price / performance ratio is not very satisfactory."
0,酒店性价比很差！住过无数的酒店，这个算是非常差的！服务差，设施差，房间小，骚扰电话！卫生间淋浴竟然没有门，创意啊！不知道为什么，老毛子住得多，估计是喜欢骚扰电话！建议大家选择其他酒店！,"The cost performance of the hotel is very bad!I have lived in countless hotels, this is very bad!Poor service, poor facilities, small rooms, harassing calls!The bathroom shower has no door, creativity!I don't know why, Lao Maozi lived a lot, and it is estimated that he likes harassing calls!I suggest you choose other hotels!"
0,我们是5月1日通过携程网入住的，条件是太差了，根本达不到四星级的标准，所有的东西都很陈旧，卫生间水龙头用完竟关不上，浴缸的漆面都掉了，估计是十年前的四星级吧，总之下次是不会入住了。宾馆反馈2008年6月1日：我们酒店于94正式挂牌为四星级酒店，06年和08年逐步装修了四个楼层，客房档次不同，设备新旧程度也不同，欢迎用户下次入住选择我们新装修的房间。,"We stayed through Ctrip.com on May 1st, and the conditions were too bad. The four -star standards were not met at all. Everything was very old. The bathroom faucet could not be closed.It is estimated that it is a four -star level ten years ago.Hotel feedback on June 1, 2008: Our hotel was officially listed in a four -star hotel in 94.

0,酒店设施陈旧，卫生条件很差，电视不清楚，去酒店的道路特难找，携程说该酒店近劝业场，我打的去１０元钱，大家说近不近．不过酒店的保安服务很好而且热情．定了２个房间，晚上问前台要根网线上网，告知上网不是免费的，要收１０元钱，靠，网吧多钱啊，真黑．劝大家一定别定这个酒店，后悔死你．,"The hotel facilities are outdated and the hygiene conditions are poor. The TV is unclear. It is difficult to find the road to the hotel. Ctrip said that the hotel is nearly persuading the industry. I went to 10 yuan.However, the hotel's security services are very good and enthusiastic.After setting 2 rooms, ask the front desk to go online to the Internet at night, and inform the Internet that the Internet is not free. You need to collect 10 yuan.I advise everyone to not be sure of this hotel, and regret you to die."
0,该酒店位置较为偏僻，实在不是好找。酒店的设施与想象的商务酒店有相当的差距，卫生、干净程度比起莫泰、如家等差的较远，房间里烟味极重！而且宽带上网速度极慢！本计划住两天的房间，第二天我就退了房。,"The hotel's location is relatively remote, and it is not easy to find.There is a considerable gap between the hotel's facilities and the imagination of business hotels. The degree of hygiene and cleanliness is far worse than Motai and Rujia, and the smell of smoke in the room is extremely heavy!And the broadband Internet speed is extremely slow!This plan has two days of rooms, and I leave the room the next day."
0,"感觉环境,服务方面还不够位,房间里面的洗浴设施有点发黄,需要改善!!","Feeling the environment, the service is not enough, the bathing facilities in the room are a bit yellow and need to be improved !!"
0,对这家酒店如果做评比的话是我目前入住所有如家中最差的一个！差！很差！！非常差！！！我于11/12日入住这个酒店，住的所谓的商务大床房，房间面积比较小，洗手间没有洗浴门，只有一个简单的浴帘，毛巾……这些都是些硬件设施无法改变的，最令我气愤的是下面的两件事情：1）入住房间后发现网线接头不好，打电话后前台说马上送来，我事先告诉过他们有急事要出去让他们赶快来，结果近半个小时一个人影没有来（中间打过电话人家说已经上去了……真晕……不知道的人以为他们楼层很高呢？）吃晚饭回来在此打电话才有人上来。2）因为第二天要赶早上八点的飞机，所以头天晚上要要了个morningcall早上6点的，结果第二天醒来一看已经是6：30了（幸亏我一般平时6：30起床，要是8点……真不敢想象）下去结帐时问服务员（一男生）为什么没有叫早？人家一脸茫然什么话都没有说……显得特别无辜。真是把我气个半死……因为要赶飞机也就没有跟他们过多计较，急匆匆地去拦车赶飞机了……我想在此提醒大家，无论是个人旅游还是商务出差都不要选择这家店！！服务质量太差！！真的丢燕莎店的面子.跟燕莎一店根本不是一个档次！！,"If this hotel is evaluated, it is the worst one in my current dwelling!Difference!Very bad!Intersectionvery bad!IntersectionIntersectionI stayed at this hotel on the 11/12.

I called the front desk and said it was delivered immediately. I told them that they had an urgent matter to let them go quickly.A figure hasn't come (the man in the middle said that people have been going up ... really dizzy ... do you think they think they are high?)

Friends, please refer to 6 reasons 1. The main building and the East Tower are separated.

0,非常失望！我定的是豪华单人间，想想238的价格应该是不错了吧，实际一看太失望了。房型差，大门一开就是大床，洗手间设在里面。床子极小。朝北。还有个不伦不类的便携衣橱。最难以忍受的是，晚上中央空调的外机在窗外响个不休。实在难以入睡，打电话抱怨。第一次没有予以理会。第二次再抱怨，实在让空调声音折腾的无法入眠，他们先说没有其他房间可以换。后来终于答应给我换成豪华商务房。豪华商务房与豪华单人间简直天地差别。没话说的。所以除非你定的是豪华商务房，这个宾馆是再也不考虑了！！补充点评2008年3月6日：床子极小，应为窗子极小。,"Very disappointed!I'm setting a luxury single room. Think about the price of 238 should be good. Actually it is too disappointed.The room type is poor, as soon as the door opens is a large bed, and the toilet is located inside.The bed is very small.Be north.There is also a unique portable wardrobe.The most unbearable thing is that the central air -conditioning machine in the evening rang from the window.It's really hard to fall asleep and call to complain.No reason for the first time.The second time I complained, the air -conditioning sound was really unable to fall asleep. They first said that there were no other rooms to change.Later, I finally agreed to replace me with luxury business houses.Luxury business houses are different from the world.Nothing to say.So unless you set a luxury business house, this hotel will never consider it!IntersectionSupplementary comment on March 6, 2008: The bed is very small, and the window should be very small."
0,离泰山较远，实际环境与价格不符，漂亮的外观，陈旧破烂的内里，隔音极差,"Far away from Taishan, the actual environment does not match the price, the beautiful appearance, the inside of the old and rotten inside, the sound insulation is extremely poor"
0,"晚上10点钟到达宾馆,前台一名女服务员告诉没有接到携程的传真订单,并且态度恶劣,说已经没有标准间了,只能住套间,我们与携程取得联系后,前台翻了翻管理极为混乱的订单后,告诉我们说我们已经入住过了,简直可笑至极.后这名服务员给我们的房间还是标准间,(之前说没标准间),但都是靠楼边的,房间很小,每间房内高高耸立着一个大柱子.客房服务员也是冷冰冰的,客人要求送物品到房间后向其表达写意时,服务员都是板着脸扭头而去,建议酒店应加强单据的管理及服务员业务的培训.","When I arrived at the hotel at 10 o'clock in the evening, a female waiter in the front desk told that she did not receive a fax order from Ctrip, and the attitude was harsh. I said that there was no standard room. We could only live in the suite. After we got in touch with Ctrip.After chaotic orders, I told us that we had been in, and it was very ridiculous. Later, the waiter gave our room or a standard room; (there was no standard room before), but they were all on the side of the building. The room was small.There is a large pillar in each room. The waiter is also cold. When the guest asked to send items to the room, when they express their freehands, the waiters turned their heads with their heads.Business training."

0,夜里没有空调，房间又没有窗户，热的不得了，早上来空调以后又冷，害得两个人都感冒。问酒店怎么回事酒店说是威海市酒店都这样，电力局晚上给关的。但是本人强烈怀疑他们的解释，要停电都停电怎么可能只有空调没有呢?而且，我们后来搬到国际海景城酒店公寓就没发生停空调现象。另外酒店离海边很远，走路最少20分钟。,"There is no air conditioner at night, and there are no windows in the room.Asked what happened to the hotel, the hotel said that it was the hotel in Weihai. The Electric Power Bureau gave it at night.However, I strongly doubt their explanation, how can only the air conditioning be available for power outages? Moreover, we later moved to the International Sea View City Hotel apartment without air -conditioning.In addition, the hotel is far from the seaside, walking at least 20 minutes."
0,1、自助餐：自助方式很经济，但是每个菜都要刷卡，麻烦！酒店员工不知道礼让客人？首次遇见啊！各位如果想知道被服务员拥挤的感觉，请入住该“汉爵”。,"1.

0,住的是二层的大床房，没有暖气只有空调房间超小不说，墙壁脱落，卫生间问题多多（灯的噪音很大），是我住的所有经济酒店最差的，大概是临近长安街延长线的缘故，交通较方便时唯一的卖点！！大床房内用具一律是一个人的，如果是两个人入住须要再通知前台申请。网线要特别通知前台送来，可是服务台说，我们宾馆是八点上班，所有的用具八点以后您再打电话吧，天呐岂有此理！！！在说一句我住的二层，大概由于一层是餐厅的缘故，你在房间里可以闻到窜入的油烟味。各位一定三思呀，再下的经验供各位参考。,"I live in a large bed room on the second floor. There is no heating, but the air -conditioned room is super small.Because of the extension line, the only selling point when traffic is more convenient!IntersectionThe utensils in the large bed room are all one person.The network cable should be sent specially to the front desk, but the service desk said that our hotel is at 8 o'clock.

You can smell the smell of oil fume in the room.Everyone must think twice, and then the experience for you for reference."
0,空调温度不足，很冷。因为宾馆在纳爱斯傍边，一早起来一股洗衣粉的味道，虽在丽水，空气质量却极差，纳爱斯要负责任的。宾馆管理不到位，8点多一点，客人还在吃早餐，却把电灯都关了，虽说节能，但感觉太小家子气了。,"The temperature of the air conditioner is insufficient and cold.Because the hotel was beside Naisi, the smell of laundry powder was up early in the morning. Although in Lishui, the air quality was very poor, and Naisi was responsible.The hotel's management was not in place. At more than 8 o'clock, the guests were still eating breakfast, but turned off the electric lights. Although energy saving, it felt too young."

0,请不要相信携程上的照片，三张照片中第三张房间内的与事实还比较相近，第一张不知是什么地方，度假村环境虽然尚可，但绝对没有照片中那么美；第二张，相信是国际会议中心贵宾楼而不是度假村。,"Please don't believe the photos on Ctrip. The third room in the three photos is similar to the facts.

0,"本次的预定是帮我同事的,据他们在酒店的感受.....总的来说很不满意!第一,该酒店说是2006年开业,实际上是2006年从别人手中接转过来的,不知道具体是哪一年的酒店,酒店设施很旧;第二,入住的当天,因预定同前台没有沟通,差点导致客人没有房间(结果通过携程的协助才得到解决:通过携程预定成功,但酒店没有留房),后来好象是抽调出的两个房间;第三,入住酒店1015房间情况:流出的水比较脏,风筒也是坏的,报修了很久都没有结果,最后还是通过携程协助才搞定那个风筒;第四,酒店服务员对客人的态度比较不好,1015房洗手间内没有浴缸,客人问是否带浴缸的房间,服务人员说没有,结果客人第二天早上路过1011房间时,通过开着的门看到该房间恰有浴缸,不明白服务员为什么要欺骗客人;第五,早餐时,餐厅服务人员竟然替客人签早餐账单(据后来通过携程调查后,由该酒店前台服务人员电话说是这样的,因当时怀疑属前台设置了相同房间的两张房卡,但其销售部经理说不可能会发生这样的事---感受非常不安全),虽说只有30元钱,但对待客人的态度恶劣---不相信客人有支付能力,怕客人逃单;员工培训不到位,不知道如何服务;最后,我们以后去北京一定不会再去住这家酒店了,也不会再推荐朋友或是同事入住这家酒店的.补充点评2007年10月23日：入住及退房都因为上述情况而耽误了很多的时间!不会考虑帮客人节约时间!","The reservation of this time is to help my colleagues. According to their feelings in the hotel ..... Generally speaking, I am very dissatisfied! First, the hotel said that it opened in 2006. In fact, it was actually transferred from others in 2006.Come here, I don't know which year's hotel, the hotel facilities are very old; second, on the day of staying, there was no communication with the front desk, which almost caused guests to have no room (as a result, it was resolved through the assistance of Ctrip: Ctrip is reserved through Ctrip's reservation.Success, but the hotel did not stay in the house), and then it seemed to be two rooms that were tuned; third, the situation of room 1015 in the hotel: The flowing water was dirty, and the air cylinder was bad.Only through the assistance of Ctrip to get the fans; fourth, the hotel waiter's attitude towards the guests is not good. There is no bathtub in the handroom of the 1015 room. The guest asked if the room with a bathtub.In the room, I saw that the room had a bathtub through the open door, and did not understand why the waiter deceived the guests; fifth, during breakfast, the restaurant service staff even signed a breakfast bill for the guests (according to the Ctrip surveyThe front desk service staff said that this was like this, because at that time, there were two room cards that were set up in the same room at the time, but the sales manager said that it was impossible to happen-the feeling was very unsafe), although it was only 30 yuanMoney, but the attitude towards guests is bad --- do not believe that guests have the ability to pay, afraid that the guests will escape the bill; employee training will not be in place, and we will not know how to serve; in the end, we will not stay in Beijing in the future.I will not recommend friends or colleagues to stay in this hotel.

0,前台服务太慢，前台男生的态度极差，极差；电梯本来只有两部，却始终都有一个在维修，上下电梯，每层都停留，有时甚至等两次才坐得上；房间卫生不好，地面好像不做清洁，卫生间不干净，毛巾好像抹布一样，还有怪味；水杯都是塑料的；打电话要吹风机和插座，竟然让客人自己去前台拿；淋浴喷头漏水严重，打电话告知前台，竟然派保安充当维修工上来房间察看。锦江之星，再也不想住啦！,"The front desk service is too slow. The attitude of the boys at the front desk is extremely poor; there are only two elevators in the elevator, but there are always one in maintenance, upper and lower elevators, and each floor stays.Okay, the ground does not seem to be clean, the bathroom is not clean, the towels seem to be like a rag, and there are strange flavors; the water cup is plastic; calling the hair dryer and socket, and the guests go to the front desk to take it;The front desk was informed that the security guard was sent as a maintenance worker to go to the room for inspection.Jinjiang Star, never want to live anymore!"

0,几年来，锦江之星在我心目中的位置已经从经济酒店中从第一位跌到了第四五位。而这一次，更是导致我从此以后再也不会住这一品牌的酒店。千里之堤，可能会崩于蚁穴。而蚁穴之不察，则非偶然。这次入住，因为行程原因。需要在最后一天早晨退房，下午再回来领取行李。这件非常简单的事情，可是一个胖职员却说由于奥运会和警方要求，因此退房时行李必须带走。但是我问酒店其他职员时，却都说下午六点前提取行李均可。为了核实，我打了服务电话，电话中也说可以到六点前回来提取。因此，我再次咨询了该胖职员，他也改口说届时可以为我安排。但是，早上退房时，那胖职员却坚决要我们把行李带走。还说其他职员的说法是他们“没有领会到精神”！无奈之下只有将行李带走。结果那天上午参加的三个会议穿插在了繁重的行李搬运之中，实在苦不堪言。在此之前，我在杭州另一个品牌经济酒店住宿，旅客的行李可以寄存数日，方便旅客在周边城市游玩；昨天晚上，我入住了上海的另一家酒店，行李照样可以在晚上12点前提取。锦江之星要求在六点前提走的规定本来就已经是比较苛刻的了，而这一个胖职员的所作所为，更是太过分了！我要问问这位胖职员：是不是全中国的酒店，全上海的酒店，包括他的所有同事，都“没有领会到精神”？模式化的礼貌表面下，完全没有一颗为顾客考虑的心，这可能就是锦江之星开始僵化的表现！作为一个普通顾客，我们也没有权力要求锦江之星怎么做。我们唯一能做的，就只是用脚投票：永远不再入住锦江之星！,"Over the past few years, Jinjiang Star's position in my mind has fallen from the first place in the economic hotel to fourth fifth.This time, it has caused me to never stay in this brand of hotels.The embankment of thousands of miles may collapse in the ant hole.The anthrontal is not accidental.This time, due to the itinerary.You need to check out on the last morning, and come back to pick up your luggage in the afternoon.This very simple thing, but a fat staff said that due to the Olympic Games and the police request, the luggage must be taken away during check -up.However, when I asked other staff members of the hotel, they all said that they can be taken at 6 o'clock in the afternoon.In order to verify, I made a service call, and I also said that I could come back to extract until six o'clock.Therefore, I consulted the fat staff again, and he also said that he could arrange for me at that time.However, when checking out in the morning, the fat staff resolutely asked us to take our luggage away.He also said that other staff said that they ""did not understand the spirit""!In desperation, only take the luggage away.As a result, the three meetings I attended that morning were interspersed with heavy luggage transportation, which was really miserable.Prior to this, I stayed in another brand economy hotel in Hangzhou. Passengers' luggage can be stored for several days to facilitate passengers to play in the surrounding cities. Last night, I stayed in another hotel in Shanghai.EssenceJinjiang Star's requirement that the provisions of the premise of six o'clock are already relatively harsh, and what this fat staff does is too much!I want to ask this fat staff: Is it a hotel in China? Hotels in Shanghai, including all his colleagues, ""not understanding the spirit""?On the surface of the modular politeness, there is no heart that is considered by customers at all. This may be the performance of Jinjiang Star's starting rigidity!As an ordinary customer, we have no power to ask the Jinjiang Star what to do.The only thing we can do is to vote with your feet: never stay in Jinjiang Star!"

0,是第二次入住，因为离客户很近，图个方便。先说第一次的入住，空调不冷搞得房间像桑拿房一样，我把它归类为运气问题，略过不计，可是网络速度慢到只能用不可思议来形容。中国电信的宽频服务在这个酒店居然速度比拨号上网还慢，我算是开了眼界。再说第二次，从checkin开始，就让我决定了不会再来这个酒店住第三次，前台那个男员工，吊儿郎当不说，再加上一副爱理不理的腔调，问三句话还只勉强回了几个字，我想，那搞不好是老板的儿子，要不然我还真想不出酒店用这种员工的原因何在。早餐烹饪区的厨师也是不知道怎么教育的，老是躲来躲去，想下一碗面，站了半天硬是见不到人，后面服务台的小姐索性也装作没看到我，估计是希望多一事不如少一事吧。房间设备这次倒是正常了。想赶走一个客人就是这么轻而易举的事。没办法发现或管理好不适用的员工，那是酒店管理的问题了。我只能说，如果贵酒店觉得自己根本就不想做个四星级酒店，那我为了我的吹毛求疵道歉。也对绝大多数兢兢业业的员工表示歉意。,"It was the second time to stay, because it was very close to the customer, the picture was convenient.Let's talk about the first check -in. The air conditioner is not cold like a sauna room. I classify it as a problem of luck.China Telecom's broadband service is actually slower than dial -up online. I have opened my eyes.Besides, from Checkin, I decided that I would not come to this hotel for the third time. The male employee at the front desk, Ding Erlang should not say it, plus a reasonable tone, ask the three sentences.I only barely returned a few words. I think it ’s the son of the boss, otherwise I really ca n’t think of the reason why the hotel uses such employees.The chefs in the breakfast cooking area do not know how to educate. I always hide and hide. I want to take the next bowl of noodles. After standing for a long time, I can’t see anyone.Hope more than one thing is not as less.The room equipment is normal this time.It's so easy to drive away a guest.There is no way to find or manage employees who are not applicable. That is a problem with hotel management.I can only say that if you don't want to be a four -star hotel at all, I apologize for my fault.He also apologized for most of the dedicated employees."
0,交通不方便，没什么车，隔音很差，虽然是新开的，但是同价位还是选择汉庭和莫泰吧，房间感觉就像是纸糊的，浴室太差了,"The transportation is inconvenient, there is no car, and the sound insulation is very poor. Although it is newly opened, the same price still chooses Han Ting and Motai. The room feels like a paper. The bathroom is too bad."
0,位置偏，周围黑漆漆的。本地人开车都找了好久才找到。房间装修很是一般，可以说是有点差，就10几年的老装修。还是住潭江半岛酒店吧，虽然潭江半岛酒店也不是很让我满意。但是为了出行安全考虑，建议各位还是不要去住该假日酒店。此假日酒店和鼎鼎有名的假日酒店真是非洲和欧洲的区别啊。,"The position is biased, the surrounding black paint.The locals have been found for a long time after driving.The decoration of the room is very average. It can be said that it is a bit bad, just over 10 years of old decoration.Still staying at the Tanjiang Peninsula Hotel, although the Tanjiang Peninsula Hotel is not very satisfied with me.But for the sake of travel safety, it is recommended that you do not stay in the holiday hotel.This holiday hotel and famous holiday hotels are really the differences between Africa and Europe."
0,交通方便，这是唯一的入住理由。当然，晚上比较吵，可能的话尽量别选择面对火车站的房间。房间一般，尤其是相对这个价位来说，卫生间很小，而且昏暗。我到的时候是凌晨，酒店有半价房间120－140，比携程的198便宜不少。酒店服务的态度还行，但是我早餐的时候朝我要了8块钱才让进餐厅，明明入住的时候说是包括早餐的，因为要赶火车，懒得理论了，而且早餐相当差劲，大家住的时候千万别吃啊。,"Convenient transportation is the only reason for check -in.Of course, it is more noisy at night. If possible, try not to face the room of the railway station.The room is average, especially for this price, the bathroom is small and dim.When I arrived, it was early in the morning. The hotel had a half -price room of 120-140, which was much cheaper than Ctrip's 198.The attitude of the hotel service is okay, but I asked me 8 yuan to let me enter the restaurant when I was breakfast. When I was staying in, I said that it included breakfast, because I had to catch the train, I was too lazy to theory, and the breakfast was quite bad. Everyone lived in.Don't eat it."
0,"总体来说还比较满意,但主要的是临街,窗户的隔音效果不好.酒店价格单间在200--220元,比较合适也比较接近酒店的装修档次.","Generally speaking, it is relatively satisfactory, but the main thing is the street, the sound insulation effect of the window is not good.

0,到达后前台说刷卡需要直接消费，因此采用现金押金，最后用信用卡结账（因为异地取现金要支付手续费用，所以，不愿多用现金支付房费）刚进入房间，拉开桌子抽屉就发现两个蟑螂，立刻电话通知客房中心，久等不来，连续三次电话，来了一个服务员，满不在乎的拿了一个药在喷。而且说他们天天喷药。晚上，进入洗手间，发现蟑螂，行李箱下面也是蟑螂，就把服务员留下的药拼命的喷。第二天早晨，起来穿鞋，还是蟑螂。清晨，电话到前台要求换房，前台解释说，可能楼层太低，所以，蟑螂从餐厅跑到了客房，我要求由服务员直接送另外房间房卡，可是前台说必须本人来。无奈下楼办手续，却告知必须先结账，再入住。无奈，结账，重新办理入住。换至最高楼层，感觉稍好。下午，发现刚买的食物上又是蟑螂。顿时恶心不止。再次通知客房中心。还是药喷。忍了两天，退房走人。结果退房时，说第一天费用已经入账，不能再退还第一天房费的现金押金。跟酒店前台拍着桌子发了一通火，又同意刷卡结付所有费用，退还现金了。发誓再也不会到此酒店。,"When you arrive at the front desk, you need to spend directly from swiping cards, so cash deposits are used, and finally the credit card will check out (because you need to pay the procedure for cash in different places, so you are unwilling to pay more with cash) just entered the room.Cockroaches, immediately called the guest room center. I couldn't wait for a long time. I couldn't wait for a long time. I called three times in a row. A waiter came.And say they spray medicine every day.In the evening, when I entered the bathroom, I found cockroaches and cockroaches under the luggage.The next morning, I wore shoes, or cockroaches.In the early morning, the phone went to the front desk to change the house. The front desk explained that the floor may be too low. Therefore, cockroaches run from the restaurant to the guest room. I ask the waiter to send the other room card directly, but the front desk said that I must come.Helplessly went downstairs to go through the formalities, but informed that they must check out first.Helpless, checkout, re -check -in.It feels a little better to change to the highest floor.In the afternoon, I found that the food I just bought was cockroaches again.Suddenly nausea.Notify the guest room center again.Still medicine spray.After two days of ending, check out.As a result, when checking out, it was said that the first day of the fee had been paid, and the cash deposit of the first day's house fee could not be returned.I patted the table with a table at the front desk of the hotel, and agreed to swipe the card to pay all the fees and refund the cash.You will never get to the hotel again."

0,看了上个朋友的帖子，订的这个酒店，但是情况有的地方却不一样，对比如下：原来定的是标间，没有了，免费升的豪华标准间，房间不错。就是楼下的汽车噪音很大，感觉兰州人素质还不行，没事按喇叭，早晨很吵。更可气的是，早上7点，对面单位的大喇叭开始广播，非常吵。门口几个服务生的服务一般，好像他们的任务就是站在那儿。酒店的位置很偏，出租很难叫，一般要等10分钟，我拿着大包站在那儿，从来没人帮我打车啊。服务很差，入住时明明说好住两天，还押了1000押金，第二天中午回来，门打不开，找客房中心，不理，告知必须到前台处理。我很生气，跑到前台，质问前台，为什么这样，前台的小姐白眼一翻，根本不理。刷卡，往我面前一扔。我问，早餐券呢？答曰：下午四点送到房间。我说，入住时间你们都搞错了，早餐券怎么能保证呢？答曰：我说的，肯定可以。把我气的够呛，回房间投诉，给我转到商务中心，真不明白商务中心还有这功能呢。一通胡扯，什么酒店的门禁系统出故障了等等，反正他们没有错，都是我的错....。第二天，下午6电回房间，找早餐券，没有，找前台，告知每人答应要送到房间，送券是服务员，不是前台。再投诉，才把早餐券送过来，同样的理由是工作忙等等，反正是没有错....，气的你没话说。早餐非常一般，如果你8点去，只剩下菜汤啦。总结：1、房间还可以。2、环境很差，不是绿化的不好，而是太偏，非常难打车。3、服务太差，70年代的水平吧。还象还不想改进。4、宽带网很慢。补充点评2007年8月27日：对了，周围很荒凉，如果要吃饭啥的，得打车出去很远。更可气的是，出租车非常难打。,"After reading the post of a friend, the hotel is booked, but there are different places in the situation. The comparison is as follows: the original is the standard room, no, the free rising luxury standard room, the room is good.It is the noise of the car downstairs. It feels that the quality of the people in Lanzhou is not good. It is okay to press the horn.What's even more angry is that at 7 am, the big horn of the opposite unit started broadcasting, which was very noisy.Several waiters at the door are services, as if their task is standing there.The location of the hotel is very biased, and it is difficult to call for rent. Generally, it takes 10 minutes. I stand there with a big bag and never help me take a taxi.The service was very poor. During the check -in, I said that I lived up for two days. I also borrowed 1,000 deposits. I returned at noon the next day.I was very angry and ran to the front desk and questioned the front desk. Why did this, the lady in the front desk turned her eyes and ignored it at all.Swipe the card and throw it in front of me.I asked, what about breakfast coupons?Answer: Send to the room at four in the afternoon.I said, you have made a mistake in check -in time. How can the breakfast coupon be guaranteed?Answer: What I said, it is okay.I really don't understand the business center and this function to return me to the business center.A nonsense, any hotel's access control system failed, etc. Anyway, they are not wrong, it's all my fault ...The next day, 6 electricity returned to the room in the afternoon, looking for breakfast coupons, no, find the front desk, and inform everyone that everyone promised to send it to the room. The delivery was a waiter, not the front desk.Then complained that the breakfast coupons were sent over. The same reason was busy at work, etc. Anyway, there was nothing wrong with ..., you have nothing to say.Breakfast is very average. If you go 8 o'clock, only vegetable soup is left.Summary: 1. The room is okay.2. The environment is poor, not green, but too biased, very difficult to take a taxi.3. The service is too poor, the level of the 1970s.It still doesn't want to improve.4. Broadband network is very slow.Supplementary comment on August 27, 2007: By the way, it is very desolate. If you want to eat or something, you have to take a taxi very far.What's even more angry is that taxis are very difficult to fight."
0,服务实在差！临退房时，如家前台非说我们的毛巾不干净，洗不掉，要高额罚款。没办法，我们又退回房间，当着如家清洁人员的面帮他们将毛巾洗得非常干净！如家的工作人员见状，马上说“我们的工作人员没有义务洗毛巾，都是洗衣房洗”。我们找经理，经理说“如家没有洗衣粉，没有义务洗，所有如果有不干净的迹象，我们只能要求客户赔！”我晕死了！难道客户相比如家，更有义务洗毛巾么？！其实，包头有很多酒店非常便宜，如家并不算便宜的，服务又差！下次去，不住那儿了！,"The service is really bad!When you retreat, the front platform of the home does not say that our towels are not clean and cannot be washed away.No way, we returned to the room and helped them wash their towels very clean in front of Rujia cleaning staff!When the staff of the family saw this, they immediately said, ""Our staff members are not obliged to wash towels, they are washing rooms.""We were looking for the manager. The manager said, ""If you do n’t have a laundry powder, there is no obligation to wash. If you have signs of unclean, we can only ask customers to pay!"" I fainted!Is it more obliged to wash towels for customers?IntersectionIn fact, there are many hotels in Baotou very cheap. If home is not cheap, the service is poor!Go next time, can't live there anymore!"
0,这次的感觉一点也不好，定了一天房，因为有事情，下午四点退了房间，居然收了一天房钱，前台服务十分不好，那个男服务生没有水平，希望如家可以过问一下。,"The feeling this time is not good at all. I set a day of room, because there was something, I retired at 4 pm, and I took a day of room money. The front desk service was very bad. The male waiter had no level. I hope that if you are a home, you can ask as a home.Essence"
0,我本人办的有锦江之星的会员卡，相对来说锦江住的比较多，石家庄的锦江我只住过平安大街店，感觉非常不错，这次是因为平安大街的锦江之星没有商务房了，所以才选择了从未住过的如家。如家，外人的评价一直挺不错的，我就亲身去感受了一下，感觉非常失望。这是我第一次入住如家，不知道是不是这家酒店的使用率太高了，设施都比较陈旧。浴巾的边沿部分都磨烂了，被子也感觉洗了很多次旧旧的。周六外出游玩回来的时候竟然发现浴室的梳子没有更换、香皂没有更换，黄色牙刷的刷头与握柄中间竟然有黑黑的东西，看起来好脏。一般酒店的隔音都不会很好，可是我没想到如家国大店的隔音竟然差到门口塑料袋的摩擦声都可以听得到。而且浴室特别小，唯一比较满意的地方大概就是工作人员的服务了，还不错，总之，我不会再去第二次如家了，太差了，让我很失望，对不起这个价格。补充点评2008年7月28日：以上评价只代表我和我老公的意见，只把我们入住时遇到的情况写了出来，可能我们遇到的只是个案，不过让我感到失望是真的。另外再补充一点，如家的前台工作人员，穿的花衬衫确实有热带风情，只是感觉很花哨，不喜欢。,"I have a member card with Jinjiang Star. Relatively speaking, Jinjiang lives a lot. Jinjiang in Shijiazhuang has only lived in Ping An Street Store. It feels very good., So I chose Rujia who has never lived.Such as home, the evaluation of outsiders has always been pretty good, I went to feel it in person, and I felt very disappointed.This is the first time I stayed at home. I don't know if the usage rate of this hotel is too high, and the facilities are relatively old.The edge of the bath towel was rotten, and the quilt felt the old ones many times.When I came back on Saturday, I found that the comb in the bathroom was not replaced, soap was not replaced, and there were dark things in the middle of the brush head and handle of the yellow toothbrush, which looked so dirty.Generally, the sound insulation of the hotel will not be very good, but I did not expect that the sound insulation of Rujia Guodian store can be heard by the friction of the plastic bag at the door.And the bathroom is particularly small. The only thing that is more satisfied is probably the service of the staff. It is not bad. In short, I will not go to the second time again. It is too bad to disappoint me. Sorry for this price.Supplementary comment on July 28, 2008: The above evaluation only represents the opinions of me and my husband. I only wrote the situation we encountered when we moved in. Maybe what we encountered was just a case, but it was true that I was disappointed.In addition, a little more supplemented, such as the front desk staff of the family, the flower shirts they wear do have tropical style, but they just feel fancy and don't like it."
0,"位置一般,门口还在修路,沙尘滚滚,附近没有像样的食店,不建议入住","The location is average, the door is still building roads, sand and dust are rolling, there are no decent restaurants nearby. It is not recommended to check in"
0,记得是3月18日入住，通过携程预定一个3－4楼的商务大床，结果给的1楼，我要求的洗澡设施良好也没有达到，喷头根本固定不住。因为这次是1天也就没有要求更换房间，比起第一次在这里的预定（不是携程），这次非常不满意，终于体验到预定要求无法达到是什么感觉了！！！,"I remember staying on March 18th, and I scheduled a large -scale business bed on the 3-4th floor through Ctrip. As a result, the 1st floor was given, and the bathing facilities I asked for were not reached. The nozzle could not be fixed at all.Because this time, there is no request to change the room. Compared with the first scheduled (not Ctrip) here, this time I was very dissatisfied. Finally, I experienced what the scheduled request could not meet!IntersectionIntersection"
0,这个酒店那是相当的差，民宅改建的，里面的设备和家具多数不全，刷牙的杯子也是破的，电器有的是坏的，晚上前台开着门睡觉，基本保证不了安全，早餐就是花生米＋油条＋包子+稀饭一般，位置在高架下面，不过还算安静，就是周围吃饭和买东西不是特别方便，唯一的特点就是曲径通幽了,"This hotel is quite poor. The house is converted. Most of the equipment and furniture inside are incomplete.+Bun+porridge is average, and the location is under elevated, but it is quiet, that is, eating and buying things around are not particularly convenient. The only feature is that the curvature is faint."
0,是我家住过的最差的酒店！居然还是携程的推荐！理由：工作人员素质差。房间设备质量差。早餐环境像闹市。因为是自驾游，考虑到停车方便，选择了离市区较远的凯悦。下午五点到的宾馆，由于携程网页上提供的信息有误，前台既没有解决问题的诚意（前台经理居然在途中人间蒸发，不见踪影），又不肯主动和携程取得联系。只能由我们自己联系携程。而携程工作人员什么要去调查啦、需要时间协调啦等等，结果到我们妥协（还是没能入住预定的房间）已经是晚上七点半。因为我们实在是又冷又饿，没有精力坚持下去了。大堂居然没有空调，在春节的寒冬里真是考验毅力的：（一般我家都是在宾馆用晚餐，考虑到刚才受到的待遇，决定出去吃。周围一无所有，还好隔壁就有迪欧咖啡，这顿晚餐还是不错。回到房间晚上九点，刚打算洗澡，发现淋浴的水龙头是坏的，一打开，水流会有上下左右n个方向，往上的水流打到吊顶上，再从吊顶反射回来，越过玻璃隔层，弄得卫生间一塌糊涂。打电话保修，隔了很久再来，来了后，一会儿说没有替换零件，一会儿说修不好，我们一度要求换房（已经将近11点），但酒店方强调只能提供低一档次的房间。到了11点半总算修好，打电话要求客房清扫（修理工说不能直接通知客房部，因为不是一个部门。），客房部说中班人员已经下班，要打扫只能到明天早上！打电话到大堂经理投诉（宾馆指南里写明24小时值班），被告知大堂经理下班了。再打电话到前台，好话坏话说尽，总算来了位小姐，马马虎虎弄了一下。因为带个孩子，要求加床，没有！那么要求加一床被子，也没有！这是什么地方呀。洗好睡下，已经是第二天的凌晨了。：（那个累呀，无法形容。早餐说明是到早上九点。八点半下去吃饭，“强”就一个字！整个大厅人头济济，乱哄哄的像闹市。这个盆子空的，那个盆子仅剩下铺垫的菜叶，每个人都在争先恐后地拿着仅有的一些食品，地上脏乱不堪。杯子、小碗已经没有，抢着那几个一次性纸杯。六个小窝窝头，刮的最后一点点粥，三个茶叶蛋，三段玉米棒，这就是我家大年初四早餐的全部。checkout时，虽然昨天的几位前台，包括那位经理都在，没有一个人向我们表示一下慰问，哪怕是礼仪上的一个招呼。宾馆反馈2008年4月9日：尊敬的客户，针对您的入住当天出现的问题所产生的投诉，本酒店虽高度重视而且采取了最大限度的弥补也未能平复您的不满，酒店方再次向您表示歉意，春节期间客情虽然异常繁忙，但满足于每一位顾客的需求是我们的职责所在，事后酒店针对您的投诉对相关责任人进行了行政处理，非常感谢您对我们提出的宝贵意见，这也成为我们日后管理中典型的案例来促使我们的服务更趋完善，酒店方也殷切期盼您的再次光临，让您感受到我们的服务，体现出您的尊贵。,"It is the worst hotel I have lived in my family!Actually, Ctrip's recommendation!Reason: Poor quality staff.The quality of the room equipment is poor.The breakfast environment is like a downtown.Because it is a self -driving tour, considering the convenient parking, Hyatt, which is far from the urban area.At 5 o'clock in the afternoon, because the information provided by the Ctrip web page was wrong, the front desk had no sincerity to solve the problem (the front desk manager actually evaporated on the way, no trace), and refused to take the initiative to get in touch with Ctrip.We can only contact Ctrip by ourselves.And Ctrip's staff should investigate, take time to coordinate, etc. As a result, we have compromised (still failed to stay in a predetermined room). It is 7:30 in the evening.Because we are really cold and hungry, I have no energy to persist.There is no air conditioner in the lobby. In the cold winter of the Spring Festival, I really test perseverance: (Generally, my family has dinner at the hotel. Considering the treatment I just received, I decided to go out to eat. There is nothing around me, but fortunately there is Dio coffee next door.Dinner is still good. Back to the room at 9 o'clock in the evening, I just planned to take a bath and found that the faucet of the shower was bad. As soon as it was opened, the water flow would have n directions up, down, left and right.Crossing the glass partition, the bathroom was messy. Call the warranty, and after a long time, after coming, I said that there was no replacement parts.It is emphasized that only one -grade rooms can be provided. At 11:30, it is finally repaired. Calling the guest room to clean (repair worker said that the room department cannot be notified directly because it is not a department.), The guest room department saidCan be tomorrow morning! Call the lobby manager to complain (the hotel guideline states 24 hours a duty), and the lobby manager is told to get off work. Then call to the front desk.. Because bringing a child, asking for bed, no! So request to add a quilt, no! Where is this? Wash and sleep, it is already the early morning of the next day.. Breakfast description is 9 o'clock in the morning. After 8:30, ""Strong"" is just one word!After scrambling to hold the only food, the ground is dirty. The cups and small bowls are no longer, and those disposable paper cups are grabbed. Six small nest heads, the last little porridge, three tea eggs, three tea eggs, three tea eggs, three tea eggs.The three -stage corn stick, this is all the four breakfasts of my family on the first year of the New Year. When Checkout, although the front desks of yesterday, including the manager, no one expressed condolences to us, even if it was a greeting in etiquette.Hotel feedback on April 9, 2008: Dear customers, complaints about the problems that occur on the day of your check -in, although the hotel attaches great importance to it and adopts the maximum to make up for it.You apologize, although the guest conditions during the Spring Festival are extremely busy, but the needs of each customer are our responsibilities. Afterwards, the hotel has conducted administrative treatment of the relevant responsible persons for your complaints.Opinions, this has also become a typical case in our future management to promote our services to improve. The hotel side also earnestly looks forward to your visit again, letting you feel our services and reflect your honor."
0,住了2天，受不了，好像地毯很不干净，床也不干净。后来搬到圣地（比香港酒店还新点），也就凑合吧。反正在济宁也别指望有什么酒店了，最后一天终于受不了，半夜赶到济南住CROWNEPLAZA了。,"After staying for 2 days, I couldn't stand it. It seemed that the carpet was not clean and the bed was not clean.Later, I moved to the Holy Land (more new than the Hong Kong Hotel).Anyway, don't expect any hotels in Jining anyway. On the last day, I can't stand it. I rushed to Jinan to live in Crowneplaza in the middle of the night."
0,房间的隔音效果太差，中午入住时还能听到同一楼层的赶活声音。另外，208的价格还没有早餐。,"The sound insulation effect of the room is too poor. When you enter at noon, you can still hear the sound of the same floor.In addition, the price of 208 has no breakfast."
0,有蟑螂！具可怕。解决问题的方法是想送个果盘完事。态度恶劣，只能拎包走人。,"There are cockroaches!It is terrible.The method of solving the problem is to send a fruit plate.The attitude is bad, and you can only go away."
0,"房间的墙壁与房顶因曾经严重漏水而发霉,起泡,脱落.位置不太好,门口就是消防队和南北高架路,非常吵.进住时,与其它的连锁酒店一样,全力向客人推荐成为酒店的会员,其会员价与公司协议价都明显低于携程价.结账时,速度慢,比我晚到前台的都一个个的走了,平均只需3分钟,我交了房卡后,等了足足10分钟才算结束.酒店不主动出具发票,要问服务员要,他才会开,而且开到一半,居然停下来和别的服务员对前面的几个客户的账单进行对账,又被拖了些时间.结合在全国其它城市入住的莫泰酒店的情况,对这一连锁酒店比较失望.","The walls and roofs of the room have been moldy because of severe leakage, foaming, falling off. The location is not very good. The door is the fire brigade and the north and south elevated roads. It is very noisy. Like other chain hotels, it is recommended to the guests.The membership price of the hotel is significantly lower than the Ctrip price and the company's agreement price. When the checkout, the speed is slow. It is only 3 minutes on average than those who arrive at the front desk later.After waiting for 10 minutes before the end, the hotel does not take the initiative to issue an invoice. If you want to ask the waiter, he will open it, and it will be half.It was dragged for some time. Combined with the situation of Motai Hotel in other cities across the country, it was more disappointed with this chain hotel."

0,这是我入住这么多酒店以来最不满意的一次经历，入住的第二天早上股市开市时宽带坏了，请网管来修理，结果看了看以后说是光纤坏了，要上网的话自己带电脑到大堂吧上无线，为此股票晚抛半小时，盈利严重缩水。然后想到室内游泳池游泳，又被告知游泳池在维修不开放，无奈之下只能顶着烈日外出游览，中午回酒店因太热实在没胃口，到中餐厅想要一碗面吃，结果被告知点心师傅下班了，只能吃炒菜，但这家的炒菜我前一天晚上已经领教过了，味道极差，海鲜里还满是泥沙，前一晚就为海鲜里的泥沙换了菜。回到房间宽带仍未修好，一怒之下找大堂经理投诉。结果4个小时仍未修好的宽带在10分钟内修好了。我只想问几个问题：可以做炒菜的饭店居然会下不出一碗面，你找理由让客人吃炒菜可以直接说面卖完了，又何必说点心师傅下班了，难道你们的面都是现擀出来的？宽带那么长时间修不好，投诉了就在那么短时间修好了，这不是忽悠住客是什么？表面的微笑底下是如此冷漠的服务，这和五星级的要求是不是差距太大了。,"This is the most dissatisfied experience since I stayed in so many hotels. The broadband of the stock market was broken on the stock market the next morning when I stayed in the market. As a result, I would like to see it.The computer arrived at the lobby. To this end, the stock was thrown for half an hour late, and the profit was severely shrinking.Then I thought of the indoor swimming pool swimming, and was told that the swimming pool was not open in maintenance. In desperation, I could only go out to visit with the scorching sun. I returned to the hotel at noon because I was too hot and had no appetite.When the master was off work, I could only eat cooking, but I have taught the night before the stir -fry. The taste was very poor. The seafood was full of sediment. I changed the dishes for sediment in seafood the night before.Back to the room's broadband was still not repaired, and he was looking for a lobby manager to complain.As a result, the broadband that has not been repaired for 4 hours was repaired in 10 minutes.I just want to ask a few questions: restaurants that can be made from cooking will not have a bowl of noodles. You can find a reason for the guests to say that the noodles can be sold directly.Roll out now?Broadband is not well repaired for so long, and the complaint is repaired in such a short time. Isn't this a flicker?The surface smile is such a indifferent service, is there a gap between the requirements of the five -star?"
0,客户反映此家酒店的服务和房间也就是2星级标准。尤其服务及人员素质都不尽人意，令人失望。但在网上却排在推荐第一位置，请你们要按照实际情况来向客人推荐。是一家很差的酒店。宾馆反馈2008年5月30日：我酒店一直非常重视携程网客人给我们的评价，对于客人提出的意见我们会及时的进行改正和完善。今天我们发现点评中有一位客人对我们的评价很差，于是及时联系了实际住宿客人潘先生，潘先生反映在酒店住宿期间对客房、服务都很满意，点评是其朋友填写的。华庭时尚商务酒店真诚欢迎各界朋友来我酒店入住，也希望潘先生的朋友有机会来亲身体验！我们将努力为您提供热情优质的服务。,"Customers report that the service and room of this hotel are the 2 -star standard.Especially the service and personnel quality are not satisfactory and disappointing.But on the Internet, it is ranked first. Please recommend to guests according to the actual situation.It is a poor hotel.Hotel feedback on May 30, 2008: My hotel has always attached great importance to the evaluation of Ctrip guests. We will make corrections and improvement in time for the opinions made by the guests.Today, we found that a guest in the review was very bad for us, so I contacted the actual accommodation guest, Mr. Pan in time. Mr. Pan was reported to the guest rooms and services during the hotel accommodation. The review was filled in by his friends.Huating Fashion Business Hotel sincerely welcomes friends from all walks of life to come to my hotel. I also hope that Mr. Pan's friends will have the opportunity to experience it in person!We will strive to provide you with enthusiastic and high -quality services."
0,我们预定了四个房间，下午2点十分后入住，但被告知，只有两间房，还有两件要等待。当即，我们便提出异议。当我们表示要投诉后，给出四间房。酒店门口的停车位起先有两次不让我们停车，说是有预定，保安还脱帽，解领带要和我们打架，至此，酒店方面没有一个负责人出面。直至我们向酒店提出投诉，才有人向我们表示歉意。免费的早餐其实真不值所说的要58元一位。缺少食物并不能及时添加。，服务员的服务很初级。早餐听内地服务员不少，但领位，桌面清洁很迟缓，几乎感受不到四星酒店服务。电梯应叫管理几乎没有，真不明白这家酒店是怎么评上四个星的。,"We booked four rooms and stayed at 2:00 pm, but were told that there were only two rooms and two more.Immediately, we raised objections.When we expressed their complaints, four rooms were given.The parking space at the entrance of the hotel first did not let us park twice. It was said that there was a reservation. The security guard also took off the hat. At this point, none of the person in charge of the hotel came forward.It wasn't until we made a complaint to the hotel that someone apologized to us.The free breakfast is actually not worth one for 58 yuan.Lack of food cannot be added in time.The serviceman's service is very elementary.There are a lot of mainland waiters for breakfast, but the leadership is very slow, and the four -star hotel service is almost not felt.The elevator should have little management. I really don't understand how this hotel commented on four stars."
0,其实这种酒店么，如果不是因为要赶浦东机场大早的航班肯定是没有机会住的。所以要求不能太高。晚上不会被飞机的声音吵醒，因为空调的声音完全可以盖住，不过总体上不影响休息。非常搞笑的是，冰箱是上锁的，这是我住过的最搞笑的酒店，如果没有能力查房或者对客人没有最基本的信任的话，又何必花钱装冰箱呢？每半小时有班车去候机楼，总算还是方便。,"In fact, this kind of hotel, if it wasn't for the early flight of the Pudong Airport, there would be no chance to live in.So the request should not be too high.It will not be awakened by the sound of the plane at night, because the sound of the air conditioner can be completely covered, but it does not affect the rest overall.What is very funny is that the refrigerator is locked. This is the most funny hotel I have lived. If you do n’t have the ability to check the house or do n’t have the most basic trust in the guests, why pay for the refrigerator?It is convenient to go to the waiting building every half an hour."
0,又要对他进行点评了，呜呜。。。说什么好呢,"You have to comment again, oh.EssenceEssenceWhat do you say?"

0,住了一次民国楼，说实话感觉很一般。服务可以说算差的。早餐单早，另一份居然要45，9：30早餐就结束了，9：15去居然也收45，而且没有吃两口宾馆就开始收东西了，398的房价，45的早餐啊，说时候，198的房间，免费的早餐也不会出现这样的服务。民国楼的大床房不能住，房间也特小，下次不会再选择。,"After living in the Republic of China, it feels average.The service can be said to be poor.Breakfast list is early, and the other part is actually 45, 9:30 breakfast is over, and 45 will be collected at 9:15, and it starts to collect things without eating two hotels, 398 house prices, 45 breakfast.In the 198 room, free breakfast does not appear such a service.The large bed rooms in the Republic of China cannot live, and the room is also small, and will not choose again next time."

0,酒店实际的情况比网上要差，也许是因为太远了。而且前台价比协程还便宜了十几块。真实山高皇帝远了阿,"The actual situation of the hotel is worse than the Internet, maybe because it is too far.And the front desktop price is more than a dozen yuan cheaper.Real Mountain Gao Emperor is far away"

0,凌晨近二点到店，就我一个客人在前台办手续，办了十分钟才办好，更郁闷的是酒店竟然开了一个没有打扫过的房间给我，房号463，住了这么多年的酒店还是第一次发生此类事件，凌晨二点拉着行李在酒店里至少走100米的走廊跑个来回，再下来换一个房间，酒店值班经理为此送了一份早餐。希望下次不要再次发生此类事件。第二天早上8点多退房，前台6个服务员，竟然没有一个人接待，最后还是发火了才有人理我们，如家现在真的是越来越差了，基本快放弃入住如家连锁。房间是木板隔开的，隔音超差，2点到2点半，隔壁嘿咻嘿咻，早上5点钟又开始，这次沈阳入住总共才6个小时，十分不愉快。,"When I arrived at the store at 2 o'clock in the morning, I had done the formalities in the front desk for ten minutes. It was more depressed that the hotel actually opened a room that had not been cleaned for me. The room number was 463.The hotel was the first time that such incidents happened. At 2 o'clock in the morning, I took my luggage to run back and forth at least 100 meters in the hotel, and then came down to change a room. The hotel duty manager gave a breakfast for this.I hope this kind of incident will not happen again next time.At 8 o'clock in the next morning, there were no one who received the front desk. None of the front desk was received. In the end, it was still ignited to ignore us. If the home is really getting worse and worse now, basically give up to stay in the Rujia chain.The room was separated by wooden boards, and the sound insulation was super worse. It was 2 to 2:30. The next door, hey hey, and started at 5 o'clock in the morning. This time, Shenyang was only 6 hours in total, which was very unpleasant."
0,酒店很脏，到处都是发霉的味道。在我结帐的时候，发生了一个小意外，服务员说我喝了房间的矿泉水（姑且认为她是在搞笑吧)，我让服务员把我喝过的矿泉水瓶拿下来。结果服务员（当天的值班经理）拿了一瓶农夫山泉，说是我将瓶盖打开了一半。我当场回绝。结果这个值班经理把水往前台一扔，走了。前台小姐问我说怎么办？我说你凭什么说是我将瓶子盖打开的，也许一开始就是这样的，前台说，那你进去的时候为什么不检查一下。我无语：难道要让我检查一下所有的东西，小姐，我是住店的，不是什么检查团的。请你搞清楚。于是我说了一个谎，我觉得对于这些无聊的人这是最省事的。我说我检查过，当时没有打开，现在为什么开了。一定是你们的员工干的。后来前台没办法，开了个客人拒付的单子。总之，觉得很郁闷，住了这么多携程推荐的酒店，这一家是最差的经历。,"The hotel is very dirty and moldy everywhere.When I checked out, a small accident happened. The waiter said that I drank the mineral water in the room (let's think she was funny), and I asked the waiter to take off the mineral water bottle I had drank.As a result, the waiter (on the duty manager of the day) took a bottle of farmer mountain spring, saying that I opened half of the bottle cap.I rejected on the spot.As a result, the manager on duty threw the water to the front platform and left.The lady at the front desk asked me what to do?I said why you said that I opened the bottle to open it. Maybe it was the case from the beginning. The front desk said, then why not check when you go in.I am speechless: Let me check everything. Miss, I am in the store, not a checkup.Please make it clear.So I said a lie, and I think this is the most troublesome for these boring people.I said that I checked that I didn't open it at the time, why is it now.It must be your employees.Later, there was no way at the front desk, and a list of guests refused to pay.In short, I feel very depressed. I have lived in so many hotels recommended by Ctrip. This one is the worst experience."
0,曾经住过一次经济型酒店，是宜兴的锦江之星，房间又大又干净，颇感惊喜，以为经济型酒店都是这样的。这次去成都，因为第二天一早就要赶往青城山，反正就住一晚，就选了这家离汽车站很近的如家，结果是噩梦一场。一出电梯一股异味扑面而来，打开房间，里面一片狼藉，床上、地上到处散落着...唉，不说也罢，里面的气味远超过走廊上的。赶紧打开窗，叫来正在隔壁打扫的管房，让她一定要好好打扫干净，然后赶紧走人外出吃饭。回来后房间当然是打扫了，可那异味依旧。推开卫生间门去冲澡，哇，一股浓烈的恶臭扑面而来，终于明白房间里的味道来源了，洗完澡人差不多已熏晕过去了，LG做了明智的决定：今天不洗澡了！可这房间和卫生间是联通的，这恶臭不停释放出来。我拿了条浴巾盖在地漏上，以确保房间离的恶臭浓度不再上升。睡觉时我只能开着窗，面向窗侧着睡，气味稍微淡些。这一夜难熬啊，伴着窗外建筑工地的隆隆声、汽车喇叭声、还有房间里极度的恶臭味，我迷迷糊糊估计顶多睡了3个小时。好不容易熬到天亮，赶紧收拾东西走人。第二天住在青城山的豪生国际酒店，相比之下感觉宛如天堂一般了。,"I once lived in an economical hotel, which is the star of Yixing's Jinjiang. The room is large and clean, and I am surprised that it is like this.I went to Chengdu this time because I was going to Qingcheng Mountain in the morning the next morning. Anyway, I lived for one night, and I chose the home that was very close to the bus station. The result was a nightmare.As soon as the elevator came out of the smell, opened the room, a wolf borrowed, and the bed and the ground were scattered everywhere ... Well, let's not say, the smell inside is far more than the corridor.Hurry to open the window and call the pipe house that is cleaning next door, so that she must clean it well, and then quickly walk out to eat.After returning, of course, the room was cleaned, but the odor was still.Pushing the bathroom door to take a shower, wow, a strong stink of stench came, and finally understood the source of the smell in the room.IntersectionBut this room and bathroom are connected by Unicom, which is constantly released.I took a bath towel and covered it on the floor drain to ensure that the foul odor concentration of the room was no longer rising.When I sleep, I can only open the window, sleep facing the window side, and the smell is slightly lighter.This night is difficult. With the rumbling sounds, car horn sounds, and the extremely bad odor in the room, I am obsessed with at least 3 hours.After all, I was so bright that I quickly packed up and walked away.The second day of Hao Sheng International Hotel, who lives in Qingcheng Mountain, feels like heaven."
0,"本人也是看了某些会员的评价才过来住的，真的很失望，第二天马上换地方了1、确实是够经济的,但经济的不是价钱,而是硬件和环境;2、房间小不说，连卫生间也实在够小气，够经济的，连个沙发都没有；3、10楼的房间最让人受不了，互相挨着的房间居然共用一个窗户和玻璃，隔壁有什么动静完全可以听到；4、150块钱的价格在南宁住这样的房间实在太对不起顾客了，在深圳和上海我就不说了，真的，150块南宁大把酒店比这个强啊。","I also came over after watching the evaluation of some members. It was really disappointed. The next day I changed the place immediately. 1. It was indeed economical, but the economy was not the price, but the hardware and environment.Not to mention, even the bathroom is really stingy and economical, and there is no sofa; rooms on the 3rd and 10th floor are the most unbearable. The rooms next to each other actually share a window and glass.Hearing; the price of 4,150 yuan is too sorry for customers in such a room in Nanning. I will not say it in Shenzhen and Shanghai. Really, 150 yuan Nanning is stronger than this."
0,入住两个晚上（5/30-6/1日），第一晚上被蚊子咬的无法睡觉，5月31日找前台换房间，既然还告诉我这房间是他们最好的，就是有点蚊子而已；离店时还无法提供发票，说是税务部门还没有批发票给他们（税务部门没批也可以营业吗？）。整体服务实在让人难以接受。,"Two nights (5/30-6/1), the first night was bitten by mosquitoes and could not sleep. On May 31st, I found the front desk to change the room. Since I still told me that this room is the best, it is a little mosquito.; When leaving the store, the invoice cannot be provided. It is said that the tax department has not attacked them to them (can the tax department be operated without approval?).The overall service is really difficult to accept."
0,前台服务差，尤其是入住时接待我的那位，男性，圆脸，戴眼镜。另外，我并没有见房间里有欢迎果盘。餐厅饭菜水平较差。价格贵、服务差，看样子真的不能住了。,"The front desk is poor, especially the one who receives me during the check -in, male, round face, and glasses.In addition, I did not see a welcome fruit plate in the room.The level of restaurants is poor.The price is expensive, the service is poor, and it seems that it really can't live."
0,因为公司在国贸，看到各位评价都蛮高，而且本人喜欢尝试新的事物，住了两晚上。说实话不如如家（国贸店，百子湾的那个），差了不是一丁点。管理者应该亲自进去房间看一下，打开房间门进去，屋内空气潮湿，有股异味，不知道可否在打扫完后打开窗户透透气？？床头墙壁上的画已经有霉斑，打算入睡时，发现床单上居然有小虫子（跟头皮屑那么大，白色）在爬。拉开被子一再仔细查看，不可思议的是隔着床单，发现席梦思上有貌似血迹的斑，数量>5！！装修格调很象如家，只是学到了形似。服务员没有礼貌，见人就跟没见到一样。唯一比如家好的，也就是洗澡水够大，够热。建议管理者好好去看看如家，差距不是一点半点。如家火，不是没有道理的！补充点评2007年11月2日：忘了一个，房间有UPS电源，但是没网线，要上网请自备网线。宾馆反馈2007年11月9日：尊敬的宾客，十分感谢您对我店作出细致的评论，我们已对以上提出各项问题逐一进行整改，我们也深刻认识到自身不足之处，将针对酒店的硬件和软件加以完善，尽可能为大家提供一个更加理想的商务环境和舒适的住宿条件，同时也希望大家能给本酒店提出更多宝贵意见！,"Because the company was in the international trade, I saw that everyone's evaluation was quite high, and I liked to try new things and lived for two nights.To be honest, it is not as good as home (the one of the International Trade Store, the one of Baizi Bay), and it is not a bit worse.The manager should go in the room in person to take a look at the door of the room. The air in the room is humid and there is a smell. I wonder if it can open the window after cleaning?IntersectionThe painting on the wall of the bed is already moldy. When I plan to fall asleep, I find that there are actually small bugs (as big as dandruff, white) on the sheets.Pulling the quilt to check it carefully and again, the incredible thing was separated by the sheets, and found that Xi Meng thought that there seemed to be spots that seemed like blood, quantity> 5!IntersectionThe decoration style is very like home, but just learned to look like.The waiter is not polite, and it is the same as seeing people.The only one, for example, is good at home, that is, the bath water is large enough and hot enough.It is recommended that managers take a good look at Rulai, the gap is not a little bit.Like home fire, it is not unreasonable!Supplementary comment on November 2, 2007: Forget one, there is a UPS power supply in the room, but there is no network cable, please bring your own network cable on the Internet.Hotel feedback on November 9, 2007: Dear guests, thank you very much for making a detailed comment on our store. We have rectified the above issues.The hardware and software are improved to provide you with a more ideal business environment and comfortable accommodation conditions as much as possible. At the same time, I also hope that everyone can make more valuable opinions to this hotel!"
0,也就适合做个落脚点，环境嘈杂，房间陈旧，连窗户都关不上。,"It is suitable for making a drop point, the environment is noisy, the room is old, and the windows are not closed."
0,如果不是实在订不到其它酒店，怎么也不能住这啊！条件差就差呗，价格还不便宜。我打算至少50年内不会再去了，建议携程删除此酒店。,"If it wasn't for other hotels, couldn't live this!The conditions are poor, and the price is not cheap.I plan to not go again for at least 50 years, and I suggest Ctrip to delete this hotel."
0,前台服务态度很差我是6月28好上午11点左右到酒点大堂的到了以后一男一女两位前台接待根本就不跟你打招呼问好其实也就一人在开房一人在退房把我量那儿大概有6，7分钟等他们忙好了直接从我手上接过身份证和信用卡其间一句话也没说那时候我已经有点火了我主动说我是携程订的男接待找了半天才找到单子我原先预定的大床房因为看到前面朋友的点评特意没要15号的房间我在订的时候还特地注明了男接待看也不看也不跟我说明原因直接开了15号的房间等我问他怎么是15号房间的他说已经满了我又问到我已经订好了为什么没帮我留既然没有我还要订房间干嘛他哑口了然后又查了下说有大床说要打扫房间等了10多分钟说有416然后又换了1216反正这次入住极其不爽好在房间还算干净但是设施陈旧都掉漆了以后再也不会住这家了,"The service attitude of the front desk is very poor. I arrived at the lobby lobby at the lobby of the wine at about 11 am in the morning of June 28.There were about 6 or 7 minutes when they were busy and directly took the ID card and credit card from my hands. I didn't say at that time. At that time, I had already ignited it.The big bedroom I originally booked in the list, because I saw the comments from the friends in front, I did not want the No. 15 room. When I booked it, I also specifically indicated that the male reception did not read it or explained the reason for me to open the 15th.The room waited for me to ask him why he was in Room 15. He said that it was full. I asked me why I had ordered why I did n’t help me stay. Since I did n’t, I had to book the room.The big bed said that I had to clean the room for more than 10 minutes and said that there were 416 and then changed 1216 Anyway, I was extremely uncomfortable this time in the room, but the facilities were old."
0,"之前2次是10月中旬的时候住的,记忆不是很深刻了，但是即使我再怎么不满意,我后来还是定了这里，而且一直跟朋友推荐这里，然后这次的经历真的是让我极度不爽!CTRIP预定的房间,大床,以前这样的大床,158还是168,现在的大床就是当初这样的房间,房价200多,没窗,很小，我住的房间的浴室玻璃整面下来了,被放在门口,就是大家口总说15号的房间,原来这样的房子都是特价的,然后我","The previous two times was lived in mid -October, and the memory was not very deep, but even if I was not satisfied, I later decided here, and I have always recommended it with my friends.

0,"1服务员态度一点都不好,像是欠她多少钱似的,说话很像地主婆.2进了房间像地下小旅馆,极其不满意,永远不会住这里了.3是这辈子都不会住里了,4大家可以去附近的如家83559989这个店就在他的旁边.","1 The waiter's attitude is not good at all, like how much money she owes her, talking like the landlord. 2 entered the room like a small underground hotel, and it is extremely dissatisfied.Live, 4 You can go to the nearby Rujia 83559989.

0,服务一般，房间卫生太差，居然有蟑螂弄的我和我老公身上满是疙瘩，退房时把时间逼的太紧，还必须是12点以前，让我最中意的是他们的浴室，大大的莲蓬洗澡舒服的很,"The service is average, the room is too poor, and there are cockroaches and my husband. My husband and my husband are full of puppets. When you check out, you will be too tight when you check out. It must be before 12 o'clock.The lotus puff is very comfortable to bathe"
0,拿到房间钥匙，打开门竟然发现了别人的东东，如果房间中有别人，或者是一位异性，如何处理？可怕？后来自己下楼又换了一个房间才好。结帐时竟然没有发现我预授权时的签单？让前台处理掉预授权的单据，竟然说找不到了!!可怕？好象速8酒店都不当面处理预授权的单据，为什么？让人没有信任感!!!!!!,"When I got the room key, I opened the door and found the stuff of others. If there are others or a opposite sex in the room, how do you deal with it?horrible?Later, I went downstairs to change another room.I didn't find the signing when I was authorized at the checkout?Let the front desk processing the pre -authorized document even said that it can't be found !! terrible?It seems that the fast 8 hotel is not properly handling pre -authorized documents, why?People have no sense of trust !!!!!!!"
0,"酒店隔音效果极差,没有把团队和散客分开楼层居住,导致早上6:00和晚上1:00团队客人在走廊大声喧哗,我在房内被吵醒2次以上(给电话总台让根本无人理会,最后还是我自己去和客人协商,要求他们回房间聊天.","The sound insulation effect of the hotel is very poor. The team and the scattered customers live separately. As a result, the team guests made a loud noise in the corridor at 6:00 in the morning and 1:00 pm.No one cares about it, in the end I went to negotiate with the guests by myself, asking them to go back to the room to chat."
0,这是我住过携程最烂的酒店，纯粹一招待所。听说靠近南湖，所以订一间豪间，一进门就失望了。1、进门时，大堂接待在随意的聊天，而且大堂里还有一个穿球衣的高大男子，肩膀上有很清晰的刺青。2、电梯地毯非常脏，电梯上的粘贴画已被涂鸦和损坏，也不见有人处理。3、我进房10分钟后，宽带还没开；打电话去前台，说还要十分钟。4、网速奇慢。5、晚上10点左右，网络断线，打电话房务中心，回复让我找前台，打电话前台，也没说让网管上来看看（有无网管我怀疑），说是服务器调整，让我等。6、卫生间渗水严重。7、房间布局根本不象酒店，而是招待所。8、隔音奇差无比，外面任何声音都能清晰的听见，毫无私密性可言。9、宽带接入口及不合理，在床边。我一般很少评价的，这次实在感觉糟透了。建议携程以后签定协议单位时对酒店做全面了解，不要把招待所弄成酒店，否则会砸牌子的。看来以后去嘉兴还是去香溢了。补充点评2007年7月7日：顺便说一下，我住的豪单价格为240，也不便宜。在嘉兴，同等价格的莫太、e代性价比绝对都要强。,"This is the worst hotel I have lived in Ctrip.I heard that it was close to Nanhu, so I booked a high room, and I was disappointed as soon as I entered the door.1. When entering the door, the lobby was received at a random chat, and there was a tall man wearing a jersey in the lobby, with very clear tattoos on his shoulders.2. The elevator carpet is very dirty. The paste painting on the elevator has been graffiti and damaged, and no one is dealt with.3. After I entered the room for 10 minutes, the broadband has not yet opened; it takes ten minutes to call to the front desk.4. The network speed is slow.5. At about 10 o'clock in the evening, the network is disconnected, calling the housing center, replying to let me find the front desk, call the front desk, and did not say that the network management came to see it (there is a network control me doubt), saying that it is a server adjustment, let me make mewait.6. The bathroom seepage is serious.7. The room layout is not like a hotel at all, but a guest house.8. The sound insulation is extremely poor. Any sound outside can be heard clearly, and it is selfless.9. Broadband is connected to the entrance and unreasonable, next to the bed.I usually rarely evaluate, this time it really feels bad.It is recommended to do a comprehensive understanding of the hotel when signing the agreement unit in the future. Do not make the guest house as a hotel, otherwise it will smash the brand.It seems that I will go to Jiaxing in the future.Supplementary comment on July 7, 2007: By the way, the price of the pride I live is 240, which is not cheap.In Jiaxing, Macai and E of the same price are definitely strong."
0,酒店门面好寒掺，房间好小，隔音好差，地方好难找，最最最让我不能容忍的是打电话到前台让帮着指个路居然都讲不清楚在哪里，还指错了，晕！唯一觉得还行的就是房间还算干净整洁，毕竟还新着嘛，照这服务水平以后可就难说了．宾馆反馈2008年5月23日：本酒店对携程网客户有关点评高度重视，酒店总经理室立即采取一系列措施，在行之有效的整改后，特此作如下回复：1.酒店门面重新装修，焕然一新；2.酒店房型较多，大小不一，对于携程网客户，本店将尽量安排空间大一点的房型；3.酒店对前台人员就有关公共知识，如指路、本地旅游景点、本地特产等方面的问讯工作加强了培训。,"The hotel's facade is so cold, the room is small, the sound insulation is poor, and the place is so difficult to find. The most tolerance for me is to call to the front desk to make the help in the road.,faint!The only thing that I think is still clean and tidy, after all, it is still new. It is difficult to say after this service level.Hotel feedback on May 23, 2008: The hotel attaches great importance to the relevant points of Ctrip customers. The hotel general manager's room immediately takes a series of measures. After effective rectification, this will be followed by the following: 1. The hotel's facade renovate,Huan Ran is new; 2. There are many hotel types and different sizes. For Ctrip customers, our store will try to arrange room types with larger space; 3. The hotel has about public knowledge about the front desk personnel, such as roads, local tourist attractions, local specialty products, etc.Inquiry work has strengthened training."
0,1.房间内有很大的气味（可能是墙纸胶的味道），简直无法入睡！2.晚上窗外路上有拖拉机来来往往，若开窗则声音扰人。3.早餐品种少，一般。4.酒店入住停车还要另收停车费，而且车就停在门前的路边，与别处的酒店不同，郁闷！5.房价350在平顶山属于特别高的，该酒店签约价低于300元，看来携程的价格也不底。宾馆反馈2008年2月29日：尊敬的顾客您好：针对您以上对我们酒店提出的意见我酒店已做出了相应的改善：1、我酒店房间于2月10日前全部进行了空气治理，去除异味；2、停车收费只针对过夜车辆；3、早餐品种已做出调整；4、其它问题我们更期待您能到我们酒店亲身体验。非常感谢您对我们酒店的关心支持！并希望您能一如既往的支持我们！,"1.

0,房间长时间没有通风了，只有个小窗户在床背，进去后发现整个房间一股霉气，听总台说是因我来迟了，好的都住满了，留下的是最后二个房间了，一楼的。虽然我来迟了点，但是用信用卡预订的，怎么会是最后最差的二个？,"There is no ventilation in the room for a long time. There is only a small window in the back of the bed. After entering, I found that the whole room was moldy. Listening to the main station said that because I was late, the good ones were full, and the last two rooms were left.It's on the first floor.Although I am a bit late, how can I book with a credit card?"
0,"这是我住酒店以来碰到最郁闷和龌龊的酒店,我是带着快8个月的儿子自己开车去的,亲戚已经开好其他宾馆,就是考虑儿子需要有个好环境,才决定来此酒店开一间大床房,入住的是我妈我媳妇我儿子,房间小了点但看着还温馨.开始都相对满意.进去待了一段时间就发现没空调的,儿子怕热闹的厉害,和酒店交涉了一下,结果给我们扛了把落地风扇...住4星扇风扇(就店对此事的2个说法,开始告诉我们说是因为气候没到开空调的时候,所以中央空调没打开,4星说出这话我很佩服,后来发生了更严重的事后,再提起这问题他们的答复却是在检修了),没办法就将就了用,结果晚上儿子就开始发烧了,当然也不一定是风扇吹的,也有可能是水土不服,所以我们也没有去找酒店.到了酒店开始我就把车停在了停车场(正规的停车位),等我第二天中午要用车时发现车后门被刮了有一米多长,立刻叫了酒店人员,结果他们来的人先是拿布擦,之后说调下监控看下.等了半天告诉我说这位置监控不到,我问怎么处理,他们承认了一些问题,又说了一大堆的理由,最后我报了平安车保(我买了保险),平安的让报下交警,我也让酒店的人报了交警,交警来了,他们一个人也没来处理,是我自己和交警沟通了半天,交警说第3方逃逸没法处理,保险公司会承担20%的费用,中午我要参加亲戚的婚礼,急啊.我问酒店怎么处理,他们让我先处理保险和自己的事,我找了熟人保险公司同意承担70%我告诉酒店30%要酒店承担,他们当时同意了,说你先去办事我们这么大的酒店在这不会跑的.结果等我再有时间回来处理这事的时候酒店的人员告诉我上报了以后领导不同意承担30%了,几次的来回最后的处理办法是给半天的房费作为补偿.保险情况平安定价800元承担70%560元,我承担240元,酒店承担238元的50%119元.这样的4星让我死心","This is the most depressed and stubborn hotel since I lived in the hotel. I drove with my son with almost 8 months. Relatives have already opened other hotels. I consider that my son needs a good environment before deciding to come hereThere is a large bed room in the hotel. I stayed in my mother and my daughter -in -law and my son. The room was a little smaller, but it was still warm. At the beginning, I was relatively satisfactory.I negotiated with the hotel, but I carried us a fans on the floor ... Living 4 -star fan fan (two claims of the store on the matter, began to tell us that because the climate did not turn on the air conditioner, the central air conditioner was not available, so the central air conditionerI didn't open it, I admire the 4 -star saying that, and later, the more serious afterwards happened, and then mentioned that the answer was to be maintained), but there was no way to use it.Of course, it is not necessarily blown by a fan, and it may be dissatisfied with the soil and water, so we did not go to the hotel. When I arrived at the hotel, I parked the car in the parking lot (regular parking spaces).When I used the car, I found that the back door of the car was more than one meter long, and immediately called the hotel staff. As a result, the people who came to wipe the cloth first, and then said that the surveillance was adjusted.I asked how to deal with it. They admitted some questions and said a lot of reasons. Finally, I reported to Ping An Car Insurance (I bought insurance).The traffic police came, and they did not come to deal with it alone. I had communicated with the traffic police for a long time. The traffic police said that the third party escaped and could not handle it. The insurance company would bear 20%of the cost.Ah. I asked the hotel how to deal with it, and they asked me to deal with insurance and their own affairs. I found an acquaintance insurance company to agree to 70%.The big hotel will not run here. As a result, when I have time to come back to deal with it, the hotel staff told me that the leader did not agree to bear 30%. The final processing method several times was to give it for a long time for a long time.The housing fee is a compensation. The insurance situation is 800 yuan to bear 70%560 yuan."
0,酒店的环境也不算差，价格也比较便宜，但是我建议不要去住这个酒店，我住的是高级海景房，房间相当的小，设施也很陈旧，房间里的空调噪音很大。如果我在去，我不会选择这个酒店入住了,"The environment of the hotel is not bad, and the price is cheaper, but I recommend not to stay in this hotel. I live in a high -end sea view room. The rooms are quite small, the facilities are very old, and the air conditioning in the room is very noisy.If I am going, I won't choose this hotel to stay"
0,该酒店给人的第一印象就是：不专业。缺乏培训、管理不严，抛出硬件不讲，管理上跟私人小旅馆不相上下。酒店的餐厅应该是外包的，所以下午三点我去问是否营业的时候，接待我的先生会躺在床上和我一问一答；明明开了两天的房、交了两天的押金，只过了一晚还是会来催你退房，以便她们打扫卫生；应该说从酒店的硬件上看，老板还是投了很多资的，为什么不能请一个专业点的人来管理呢？建议大家不要住，感觉实在太差，失望是必然的，气病是可能的。,"The hotel's first impression is: unprofessional.Lack of training and management is not strict, and the hardware is not said. Management is comparable to small private hotels.The restaurant in the hotel should be outsourced, so when I asked if I was open at three in the afternoon, my husband who received me would lie in bed and answer it; I opened a house for two days and paid the deposit for two days.After only one night, I will still come to urge you to check out so that they can clean it; it should be said that from the perspective of the hotel's hardware, the boss still invested a lot of capital. Why can't you ask a professional person to manage it?It is recommended that you do n’t live. It feels too bad. Disappointment is inevitable. Qi disease is possible."
0,十一期间爬泰山，住在这里。房间还算干净但是没有温馨的感觉，冷冰冰的；服务一般，前面是马路后面是水果批发市场，住在哪一面都比较吵。泰山山脚下的出租车很不厚道，下了山打车回酒店，他们说不能打表，一口价16，其实打表走也就是8块。酒店没有餐厅，第二天在对面韩国烧烤吃的晚餐，味道不正宗，但价格很便宜，他们那儿的泰山三美还算好吃，比我们第一天找了好远的一家当地鲁菜馆的好吃多了。（泰山三美就是白菜炖豆腐，当地没啥特色菜）,"During the 11th period, climbing Taishan and living here.The room is quite clean but there is no warmth, cold; the service is generally behind the road is the fruit wholesale market, and it is more noisy to live in.The taxi at the foot of Taishan Mountain was very unknown. When they got off the mountain car and returned to the hotel, they said that they could not make a watch. The price was 16. In fact, the watch is 8 yuan.There is no restaurant in the hotel.

0,令人失望的酒店！！！晚上到酒店，只见服务人员就是看着你自己搬行李，没人理睬，上去叫帮忙，竟然说人下班了，他们只管负责登记，停车也没人管，啥酒店？？？！！！第二天下去想到沙滩但被封锁，不能靠近，极其令人失望，立刻走人，再也不去了，奉劝大家也别再上当了！！！,"Disappointed hotel!IntersectionIntersectionWhen I arrived at the hotel in the evening, I saw that the service staff just looked at you to move your luggage.

0,酒店卫生条件一般，没有纱窗，入住时窗户大开，也没有蚊香，蚊子挺多。酒店有小蟑螂出现。早起赶飞机，6点多钟了，服务员仍呼呼大睡，叫了半天才来其他人结帐。感觉这家锦江之星，是我住过最差的一家连锁店，以后肯定不会入住了。,"The hotel's hygiene conditions are average. There are no screens. The windows are widely opened when they stay in, and there are no mosquito coils. There are quite a lot of mosquitoes.There are small cockroaches in the hotel.Get up early to catch the plane. At 6 o'clock, the waiter still slept and called for a long time to come to other people to check out.I feel that this Jinjiang star is the worst chain I have lived in, and I will definitely not stay in the future."
0,就是一般睡觉的地方，和如家差不多吧，还算干净，但住惯了大宾馆的人，住在这里还是有点别扭。,"It is the place where you usually sleep, just like Rujia, it ’s clean, but the people who live in a big hotel are still a bit awkward to live here."

0,告诉大家这个饭店千万别去。这说的是标准的“5”星饭店，不过是连4形都答不到的地方，里面除了饭店凉快。你就别想在找到凉快的地方，为什么呢？因为要钱。一杯冰水10块。因为大厅热的要死没办法。游泳和健身的在5星是免费对客人的，但是在这里要收钱游泳68块。健身20块一个人，打乒乓求和台球的是20，30一个小时。这是度假村啊还是一般的小饭店啊。真是有意思。说是标准的5星我看不出质量在那里，在就是员工的素质。全是附近的农民招的，因为这里到一个近的镇上有20多公里，附近也没吃的也没可以买到到东西。这里餐厅一个3块啤酒要卖到15块。而且餐厅有蝴蝶拌你吃饭呢。不知道是恶心啊还是乐趣？！5星饭店有这样的事情吗？说好下午1点退房的。当着客人的面说要问大副是不是收半天房价，可笑只既！四川的一般管理公司就是不一样。床硬的要死，洗澡的水是黄色的，我放水30分钟后还是那样的蛋黄色，本想洗泡泡浴的。这样的水能够洗澡吗？还是省省回家去吧，不信我的朋友们你们可以去感受一下在看看我的留言你们就知道是不是这样的了，我问服务员住店客人为什么还要收游泳和健身的钱。他们的回答是我们这里所有项目都是要收费的。我无语了，还能怎么样呢？大厅看上去很好。厅里的小河流的水是黄河来的水，看不到清澈的水底鱼。真遗憾。到处都有落叶不重试环境和美观。看了你来气。这直我的房费980元的套房和610元的双标吗？遗憾啊。后悔啊。还不如住在景区内的3星饭店呢。那有2家饭店收费合理直这房费的地方。也能够买到东西。也可以在外面吃到地道的农家饭。比这个所谓的5星饭店不知道要好过多少倍。那3星饭店就是在景区翡翠长廊边上。强调一下，这个”5“星饭店到景区大概应该还有20几公里，这是我的亲身体会，告诉一下我的朋友门。别花冤枉钱，住就要有个舒服的感觉和值得不值得花的钱。补充点评2007年7月20日：总之那里的环境之差是你想不到的，吃早点还是在黑黑的河水上吃的。而且吃东西的地方离主动地方很远。那床还不如3星饭店的床呢，在四川的宜宾所谓的5星饭店，真正的体会到什么是坐要坐钱，找个凉快的地方也的要钱。那你还有什么地方可以避暑或是说休息的地方呢？给钱，还不是很好的呢，去了你一定会后悔，不信你可以去了试试就知道了，况且那改死的地方离竹海还有2。30公里呢，有句话怎么说的，前不着村，后不着店的，你去了会有意思吗？更加离谱的是没挂星的地方一个2块的啤酒要卖15块一个，我靠！另可住在竹海里地星，2星饭店也不住在这里，那服务员的素质2星的都不如，普通话可以让你吃的都吐出来，我也不想在说什么了，不信的去了就知道什么是差了！！什么是后悔了！！,"Tell everyone not to go.This is the standard ""5"" star hotel, but it is where even 4 shapes cannot be answered.Don't want to find a cool place, why?Because of money.10 pieces of ice water.Because the lobby is hot, there is no way to die.Swimming and fitness are free to guests in 5 stars, but 68 yuan to collect money here.Twenty people in fitness, 20, 30 hours for ping -pong for ping -pong.Is this a resort or a general restaurant.It's really interesting.It is said that the standard 5 -star I can't see the quality there, the quality of the employees.It was all nearby farmers, because there were more than 20 kilometers in a near town, and there were no food nearby to buy things.A restaurant here is sold for 15 pieces of beer.And the restaurant has a butterfly mixed you to eat.Don't know if it is disgusting or fun?IntersectionIs there such a thing like a 5 -star hotel?Said to check out at 1 pm.In front of the guests, I asked if the vice -vice price was closed for a long time, and it was ridiculous!Sichuan general management companies are different.The bed is hard to die.

In the so -called 5 -star restaurant in Yibin in Sichuan, I really realize what is to sit on money and find a cool place for money.So what else can you avoid summer or place to rest?Give money, it's not very good. If you go, you will regret it. If you don’t believe it, you can try it. Besides, there are 2.30 kilometers from Zhuhai.Well, if you do n’t have the village before, will it be interesting if you go to the store?What is even more outrageous is that a two -piece beer is sold for 15 pieces, I depend on it!You can also live in Zhuhai, and the 2 -star hotel is not here.

There are massage halls, restaurants, hot pot restaurants, and billiard rooms in a building.What is incredible is the door of the bathroom, which is actually transparent, not an erotic hotel.

The service attitude and quality are very poor. The room is small. There is no meat for breakfast.

0,离步行街不远，步行大概10分钟。早餐一般，没什么吃的。房间好像办公室改的，粗燥简陋。服务不好，尤其是前台的一个男服务生，我早晨退房时向他要一个礼品袋好把一些杂乱的东西装起来，可他竟然要我自己再回房拿，房卡都交给他了，还要我再回房，基本的礼仪都做不到！,"Not far from the walking street, walking for about 10 minutes.Breakfast is average, there is nothing to eat.The room seemed to be changed in the office, rough and humble.The service is not good, especially a male waiter in the front desk. When I check out in the morning, I asked him a gift bag to install some messy things, but he asked me to go back to the room again.Also, I want to go back to the room again, the basic etiquette can't be done!"
0,地理位置还可以，房间的隔音不好，如果隔壁在嘿咻，你就有的听了。,"The geographical location is okay. The sound insulation in the room is not good. If you are next door, you will listen."
0,优点：交通方便，位置很不错，离海边很近，性价比相对可以；缺点1：预订了一间，没有窗户，后来更换，换了一个有半个窗户的，酒店不应该建设没有窗户的房间；缺点2：服务生不主动开发票，我走了以后才想起没有开发票，这样偷税漏税很不好；缺点3：矿泉水瓶没有标记是需要购买的，所以我饮用后被扣除3元2瓶=6元。感觉很不舒服，为这点事情投诉也没有意思，可能经营者就是这样的心理吧，能骗一个是一个；,"Advantages: convenient transportation, good position, close to the seaside, and the price / performance ratio is relatively acceptable; disadvantages 1: Book one, no windows, later replaced, changed a room with half windows, hotels should not build rooms without windows;Disadvantages 2: The waiter does not take the initiative to invoice. After I left, I remembered that there was no invoicing, so that the tax evasion was not good; disadvantages 3: The mineral water bottle needs to be purchased without marking, so I was deducted from 3 yuan and 2 bottles after drinking.6 yuan.It feels very uncomfortable, complaints for this matter are not interesting. Maybe the operator is such a psychology."
0,"房间太旧了,价格上也不实惠,不过在信阳这样的城市估计也没有什么好酒店,也只能将就了!","The room is too old and the price is not affordable, but there are no good hotels in cities like Xinyang, and it can only be involved!"
0,差，停车厂很小，才几个车位，到了酒店还没有保安迎导你，并且还要收费；房间酶迹斑斑，还号称高级房，换了一间还一样。建议携程：宁缺勿烂。,"Poor, the parking manufacturer is very small, only a few parking spaces, there are no security guards in the hotel, and they have to charge you.It is recommended to Ctrip: rather than rot."
0,以前住德清雅兰的，后转到丽晶试试。开始还行，但是今天实在是很不开心！1、前台登记，把我的信用卡仔细反复端详，始终不信任似的，丝毫不考虑查下我每星期都在他们这里住宿，而且都刷这张卡的。刷卡很顺利，但小姐怀疑的态度实在让人无法接受！2、我拿四件行李，让行李员帮忙拿一拿，却被告知：下班了！晕！才晚上十点多！3、我订的是商务大床房，却发现给我的是两小床！问，被告知两小床拼起来就是大床房！！！我实在是身心疲惫，不想自己再拖四件行李去换房了！,"In the past, I lived in Deqing Yalan, and then turned to Lijing to try it.It started, but today is really unhappy!1. Register at the front desk, and carefully look at my credit card carefully. I always do not believe it. I do n’t consider checking that I will stay here every week, and I swipe this card.Swipe the card is smooth, but the lady's doubtful attitude is really unacceptable!2. I took four pieces of luggage and asked the luggage to help take it, but I was informed: I'm off work!faint!Only ten o'clock in the evening!3. I booked a large business bed room, but I found that I gave me two small beds!Asked, the defendant was informed that the two small beds were fighting in the big bed!IntersectionIntersectionI'm really physically and mentally exhausted, I don't want to drag four luggage to change the house by myself!"
0,该饭店地点尚好，好像是军方经营，军官在酒店里不排队乘电梯。房间里的设施非常破旧，墙纸、地毯都肮脏不堪。照理说这样有历史的饭店该有待客经验，但运毛巾的与客人抢乘电梯。电梯来了，推毛巾车的大婶先把车推进电梯，回头对后面的一片抱怨声说，“对不起，你们可去乘后面的电梯！”令人目瞪口呆！！大堂只有一部电梯，每次等电梯都站到腰酸，加上军人和饭店人员抢先，往往还乘不上。我登记入住时，饭店正停水，前台也不说明，进了房间才看到一张道歉信，顿生受骗上当之感！晚上附近房间的军人好像在执行什么任务，气氛紧张，像是随时会发生枪战。只住了一晚，赶紧逃离！,"The hotel's location is still good. It seems to be operated by the military. The officers do not line up in the hotel to take the elevator.The facilities in the room were very shabby, and the wallpaper and carpet were dirty.It stands to say that such a historic restaurant should have to have the experience of guests, but the towels are carried by the guests to ride an elevator.The elevator came, and the sister -in -law who pushed the towel car first pushed the car to the elevator, and turned back to complain to the back of the back, ""I'm sorry, you can go to the elevator behind!""IntersectionThere is only one elevator in the lobby, and every time the elevator stands to the backache, and the soldiers and restaurants are the first, they often can't get rid of it.When I registered for check -in, the hotel was stopped, and the front desk was not stated. I saw an apology letter when I entered the room. Don Sheng was deceived!The soldiers in the nearby room seemed to be performing any tasks. The atmosphere was tight, as if gunfights would occur at any time.Just stayed for one night and hurried away!"
0,饭店坐地起价！协程上面6月份就定好8月10号6日6个标准间，每个300，到了那里变成380了，我们坚决不肯多出钱，饭店就说是没有6个房间，只有4个了。这不是故意变相加价吗？我们坚决不肯就范，要求协程出面解决！！最后给了总统套房，由协程出多出来的部分。如果大家以后碰到这种事情千万不能妥协，要求协程出面解决！,"The restaurant starts on the ground!In June, the coroutine will be set in the 6 standard rooms on August 10th, 600, each 300, and it becomes 380. We are resolutely refused to pay more money.EssenceIsn't this a disguised price increase?We are resolutely refused to be a model, asking the coroutine to resolve it!IntersectionFinally, the presidential suites were given, and the more part of the coroutine was given.If you encounter this kind of thing in the future, you must not compromise, and ask the coroutine to come forward to solve it!"
0,客房硬件过的去，由于我经常出差在外看过的酒店实在不少。不过服务的质量存在很大问题，我在大堂酒吧使用的饮料竟然有脏东西在里面。服务员态度也没太多在意。这点让我不满意，希望酒店方着手提高服务员的素质。,"The hardware of the rooms is going, because there are a lot of hotels I have seen outside.However, the quality of the service has a big problem. The drinks I used in the lobby bar have dirty things inside.The waiter's attitude didn't care much.This is dissatisfied with me, and I hope the hotel will use the quality of the waiter to improve the quality of the waiter."
0,总体印象：不好。暖气说要晚上十二点来，结果一直都没有，有欺骗嫌疑，由于第二天着急走，就没有去跟酒店理论了。,"Overall impression: not good.The heating said that it would come at twelve in the evening, but there was no such thing as deception. Because he was anxious the next day, he did not go to the hotel theory."
0,第一住的房都是味，地上有好香灰，后了另外一味那麽重！建酒店清生必注意，及最好有非吸,"The first living room is all tasteful, there are good gray on the ground, and then it is so heavy!When building a hotel, you must pay attention, and it is best to have a non -suction"
0,定的单人房，那个差啊！简直失望至极。房间小也就算了，小到连个桌子都没有，真不知道怎么在携程上评上的金牌推荐？进去以后先入住的高层房间，很大的一股装修的味道，打电话到前台，换到6楼，倒是没有装修了，可是整个屋里都是厨房的味道。说实话连快捷酒店的标准都达不到，不知道为什么还收着4星的价格。一般酒店如果打电话到前台说一声都会免费延迟退房时间到下午2点，连5星的一般都可以，可是他们硬要收小时费，后来加了2小时，还多了不到10分钟也要再多算2小时的费用，找经理说了半天才免掉那几分钟。这里真是我住过的最差的酒店，永远都不会再入住了。,"The fixed single room, that's bad!It's extremely disappointed.Even if the room is small, it is so small that there is no table. I really do n’t know how to recommend the gold medal recommendation on Ctrip?After entering, the high -rise room that stays first, a large decoration taste, call to the front desk, and change to the 6th floor, but there is no decoration, but the taste of the kitchen in the whole room.To be honest, the standards of express hotels cannot be met. I don't know why they still collect the price of 4 stars.Generally, if the hotel calls to the front desk and says it will delay the check -out time for free until 2 pm, even 5 stars are generally possible, but they need to charge hours. Later, they added 2 hours.If you have to count the cost of 2 hours, find the manager for half a day to avoid those few minutes.This is the worst hotel I have lived here, and I will never stay in."

0,"到目前为止，我所住过的酒店中服务最差的一家。入住时我在reception排队，共两个服务生，一个在为其他客人办理入住手续，还有一个却在和人谈天，把我撩在一边。早餐券上写着早餐在8楼，事实上在7楼，服务生也不提醒。早餐种类少之又少，位置也很少。早上送去烫的衣服到晚上还没有拿来，问housekeeping，说是要么晚上10点以后，要么第二天早上，简直没有脑子，哪有10点以后给客人送东西的，除非是送女人上门。到了10点30，又说衣服还在店里。第二天早上8：30打电话叫快点送衣服过来，结果又送了半个小时。不过在一楼大厅见到一个MM还是相当的不错。补充点评2008年4月12日：还有就是酒店和其他办公室在一起，电梯却只有3部，而其中一部又不停靠7～15楼，等电梯实在是很麻烦。宾馆反馈2008年5月8日：我们已经给我们的前台重新做了系统的培训,我相信这样的情况不会再发生.早餐也已经做过调整,室外的生态茶区已经开放出来,这个季节在那里吃早餐完全是一种享受.关于洗衣也已经重新和客房部沟通过,以后不会再出现这样的问题,请见谅.","So far, the worst service in the hotel I have lived.During the check -in, I queued at Reception. There were two waiters, one was going through the procedures for other guests, and the other was talking to people and put me aside.The breakfast is written on the 8th floor. In fact, on the 7th floor, the waiter does not remind.There are very few breakfast types and few positions.I did n’t bring the hot clothes in the morning until the evening, and asked Housekeeping, saying that it was either after 10 o'clock in the evening, or the next morning, there was no brain. How can I send things to the guests after 10 o'clock?EssenceAt 10:30, I said that the clothes were still in the store.The next morning, I called at 8:30 to send the clothes to get the clothes, and the result was half an hour.However, seeing a MM on the first floor of the hall is quite good.Supplementary comment on April 12, 2008: There are hotels and other offices, but there are only 3 elevators, and one of them is constantly leaning from 7 to 15th floor. It is troublesome to wait for the elevator.Hotel feedback on May 8, 2008: We have re -trained our front desk for our front desk. I believe that this situation will not happen again. Breakfast has been adjusted. The outdoor ecological tea area has been opened.Breakfast is completely enjoyed. About the laundry has been re -passed with the guest room ditch, and there will be no such problems in the future. Please forgive me."
0,真不知道之前的点评是怎么得出来的，还以为会是一个不错的酒店，谁知完全不是那么回事。首先酒店没有大堂，是跟写字楼在一起的，checkin要到7层。酒店正门不在马路边上，非常难找。因为是写字楼所以进进出出很多人，完全没有酒店气氛。前台服务尚可，可完全不是4星感觉啊。进了房间那叫一个失望，大床房仅比单人床宽出一点点，你说怎么让两个人睡啊？！楼道至房间所有设施都很破旧，而且看起来很不干净。如果也400元的标准来衡量，这是我在全国入住的最差的酒店了。本来预定了3天的房间结果住了一天就退房了。退房时前台还问我是不是因为他们酒店的原因，看来也不是头一回出现这样的问题了。早餐更别说了，比早点摊稍微丰富点有限。本来当时预定这个酒店就是为了地理位置好，比较方便，但是到了才发现周围有很多酒店可以选择。在它旁边有一家12月1日刚刚开业的海悦酒店，468元促销价，简直是让我捡到了大便宜，除了酒店大堂比不上君悦，其他无论是从硬件设施，还是从人员服务，还是从早餐看都绝对的5星标准。就是由于是新酒店房间稍微有些味道，希望他们可以改进。估计到了正式营业的时候绝对不是这个价格了。最近到成都出差的朋友可以试一试。,"I really do n’t know how the previous reviews came out. I thought it would be a good hotel. Who knew it was not the same.First of all, the hotel has no lobby, and it is with the office building. Checkin has to reach 7 floors.The main entrance of the hotel is not on the side of the road, it is very difficult to find.Many people enter and exit because they are office buildings, and there is no hotel atmosphere at all.The front desk service is acceptable, but it is not a 4 -star feeling at all.After entering the room, it is a disappointment. The big bed room is only a little wider than a single bed. How do you say you let the two sleep?IntersectionAll facilities from the corridor to the room are dilapidated and look very unclean.If you also measure the standard of 400 yuan, this is the worst hotel I stayed in the country.The room, which had been scheduled for 3 days, lived after a day of staying.When I check out, I also asked me if I was because of their hotel. It seemed that it was not the first time that such a problem had occurred.Not to mention breakfast, it is slightly rich than the morning stall.At that time, the hotel was originally scheduled to have a good geographical location, which was more convenient, but it was found that there were many hotels around it to choose from.There is a Haiyue Hotel just opened on December 1st next to it. The 468 yuan promotional price is simply that I have picked up the big cheap. Except for the hotel lobby, it is not comparable to Junyue., Or the 5 -star standard from the breakfast.It is because it is a little taste of the new hotel room, I hope they can improve.It is estimated that it is definitely not the price when it is officially opened.Friends who have recently come to Chengdu can try it."
0,"三个字：脏、乱、差！房间里面看上去还可以，但是仔细看，很多地方极其脏，服务人员貌似没有培训上岗的,永远封杀了!不明白的是携程竟有这样的协议宾馆,无语!所以也不能太相信携程,自己还要擦亮眼睛.","Three words: dirty, messy, poor!It looks okay in the room, but if you look closely, many places are extremely dirty, and the service staff seems to have no training to work, and it will always be blocked!

0,优点：1.地理位置不错，临近外滩、南京路、豫园；缺点：1.设置陈旧、装修和环境糟糕，价格比较贵，完全没有竞争力；2.提供的免费上网，比拨号上网慢n倍，实在无法忍受；总结：1.这样的环境和设施，把价格降一半还可以考虑；如果不是地理位置还有点优势，其它的完全对不起这样的房价；以后绝对不会再住这里。2.携程对该酒店的描述不清楚，实在是糟糕透顶！,"Advantages: 1. The geographical location is good, near the Bund, Nanjing Road, Yuyuan; Disadvantages: 1. Set up old, decorated and environmental, the price is more expensive, and there is no competitiveness at all; 2. The free Internet access providedIt is really unbearable; summary: 1. Such an environment and facilities can be considered by half of the price; if it is not a geographical location, there is still a little advantage, and the others are completely sorry for such house prices; they will never live here in the future.2. Ctrip's description of the hotel is unclear, it is really bad!"
0,非常不满意，江景房在遥远的阁楼上，没有电梯直达，自己搬运行李，还连连碰头。狭小的房间，破旧的卫生间。还有股气味（水汽和霉味）。后来实在没法，换成普通商务房。房间比较大点，不过没有窗户。住一天赶紧走人。,"Very dissatisfied. In the distant loft, Jiang Jingfang had no elevators directly. He handled his luggage by himself and met again and again.Small rooms, dilapidated bathrooms.There is also a smell (water vapor and mildew).Later, it was impossible to replace it with ordinary business houses.The room is relatively large, but there is no window.Hurry up for a day."
0,酒店的设施太差了，估计连1星级都没有，房间空调都不开的，简直就是一塌糊涂。建议大家不要去预订该酒店,The hotel's facilities are too bad. It is estimated that there is no 1 -star level. The room air conditioner is not open. It is just a mess.I suggest you not book the hotel
0,我们是6/23(一)入住的，我住5楼，房号忘了，我的评价极差1.当天我们是晚上10点checkin，前台服务人手不够，1个服务员，我前面排了两个要入住的客户，我足足等了15~20钟才办理入住手续。2.房间里居然没有附赠水，不过后来服务员有帮我们拿过来。3.最糟的是房间的清洁，床单、被单、抱枕，都有留下疑似「月经」或「精液」的东西，前者可以明显看到红色的区块，后者则是一块块不规则的区块，令我们觉得很恶心。4.唯一ok的是，请服务员来换床单与被单，手脚很快，态度亲切，其实当天已跟服务员抱怨过这个状况，并请服务员与酒店反应，服务员看到一块块的东西后也是一脸尴尬并满口抱歉。5.长城是4星酒店，我们希望能有4星以上的水准才对。宾馆反馈2008年8月11日：尊敬的宾客您好！感谢您选择入住本酒店，在您入住期间所遇到的情况，我们深表歉意，对您所反映的前台人手不足及客房卫生不尽人意的问题，酒店管理层非常重视，已要求相关部门合理调配前台员工工作时间，在客房卫生方面，我们也责令相关部门对布草的洗涤质量严格把关，并加强员工的工作责任心。最后，感谢您对酒店提出的宝贵意见，我们一定积极改善，以全新的面貌迎接您的再次光临。,"We stayed at 6/23 (I). I lived on the 5th floor. I forgot the house number. My evaluation was very poor 1. On the same day, we were at 10 o'clock in the evening. The front desk was insufficient.For a customer who was going to stay, I waited for 15 to 20 minutes before going through the procedures for check -in.2. There was no watering in the room, but the waiters later helped us get it.3. The worst is the cleaning of the room. The sheets, quilts, and pillows all leave things that are suspected of ""menstruation"" or ""semen"". The former can clearly see the red block, the latter is irregular.The block makes us feel disgusting.4. The only OK is, ask the waiter to change the sheets and quilts, with fast hands and feet, and kind attitude. In fact, he has complained to the waiter on the same day and asked the waiter to respond to the hotel.Embarrassing and sorry.5. The Great Wall is a 4 -star hotel. We hope to have a level of more than 4 stars.Hotel feedback on August 11, 2008: Dear guests!Thank you for choosing to stay in this hotel.

0,身处在一个风景区的园林式酒店环境空气很好，但房间很旧、地毯很脏、卫生间很小，最可笑的是房门关上后竟然还露着大缝子，隔音级差旁边的任一房间按门铃都以为是敲自己的房间，搞得半夜没睡着大早晨又给吵醒。,"The garden -style hotel in a scenic area is very good, but the room is very old, the carpet is dirty, and the bathroom is small.

0,酒店很有特色，古色古香。我住的是480元的标间，好贵。房间很旧，知道是老房子，也没要求太高，但是一进房间就有一股很重的霉味，是从地毯发出来的。浴室的下水道堵塞得一塌糊涂，跟前台说了，叫人来修理，修理过后依然是堵得一塌糊涂。前台服务员很友善，但是咖啡馆的就不怎么样了。我买了两张中秋嘉年华会的票，88元一张，吃自助晚餐，从质量到份量都很糟糕，说是6点到8点，不到7点就一点东西都没得吃了，这样的自助餐，最多值30元一份。票还附带欢迎饮料一份和早餐一份，两个人的房间，怎么就一份？而且还不能两天的票在一天用，明显就是要强迫你消费。欢迎饮料你到了咖啡馆才告诉你，只能喝可乐和雪碧，其它的即使同样价钱也不能喝，问为什么之前不通知？回答居然是“这是我们这里的规定”，让我感觉好像到了国营企业面对公务员一样。后来自己付钱点了一份龙井茶，茶端上来，里头尽是茶渣，还要受30元。好好那么有特色的酒店，因为不懂得管理，变得让客人感觉非常不舒服，太可惜。基本不会介绍朋友入住，除非看到有明显的改善。,"The hotel is very distinctive and antique.I live in a standard room of 480 yuan, so expensive.The room was very old. I knew that it was an old house, and it was not required too high, but as soon as I entered the room, there was a very heavy smell of mildew, which was sent out of the carpet.The sewer in the bathroom was blocked, and it told the front platform that people came to repair it. After the repair, it was still blocked.The front desk waiter is very friendly, but the cafe is not very good.I bought two votes for the Mid -Autumn Festival Carnival, 88 yuan each, eating buffet dinner, from quality to portion, which is very bad.The buffet has a maximum value of 30 yuan.Tickets are also attached to a welcome drink and breakfast.And it is not possible to use the two -day ticket in one day, obviously to force you to consume.You are welcome to tell you when you arrive at the cafe. You can only drink cola and Sprite. You ca n’t drink the others even if you are the same.The answer is actually ""this is our rule"", which makes me feel like being faced with civil servants in state -owned enterprises.Later, I paid a copy of Longjing tea by myself.It is a pity that the guests feel very uncomfortable because they do not know how to manage it because they do not know how to manage.Basically, friends will not introduce friends, unless you see significant improvements."

I think I will stay in the afternoon. I haven't taken it away when I live.Once, I opened 3 rooms with the boss 3, and I was locked. Is it stupid to open the room below? I do n’t plan to go in the future. There are still many choices around."
0,房间小，虽然有窗，但是外面是个平台，上面安装的都是空调，很吵，也不能开窗。卫生间也很小，是那种洗手液一样的洗发和沐浴液。早餐品种少的可怜。,"The room is small, although there are windows, but there is a platform outside, all of which are installed on the air conditioner, very noisy, and cannot open the window.The bathroom is also very small.Breakfast varieties are poor."
0,临街的房间，特别的吵，晚上几乎无法睡觉。房间隔音不好，白天听到隔壁“嘿咻”的声音，晚上听到隔壁打呼噜，让人无法睡觉。,"The room facing the street was particularly noisy, and it was almost impossible to sleep at night.The room was not sounding well. I heard the sound of ""Hey"" next door, and I heard the snoring next door at night, making people unable to sleep."
0,"感觉这个酒店很一般,隔音特别不好,窗户都不是中空玻璃的,又临者马路,相当吵人,一夜都睡不好,房间的隔断也挺次,旁边房间讲电话,这屋听","I feel that this hotel is very average. The sound insulation is particularly not good. The windows are not hollow glass, and the road is the road. It is quite noisy. I ca n’t sleep well all night."
0,房间还不错，床铺比较干净，这是优点。缺点：服务较差，有时候叫服务员服务员居然说你为什么不能自己动手啊，我在国内其他任何酒店从未听过。携程定的房只限二层，来之前没有人通知过。,"The room is pretty good, and the bed is relatively clean, which is advantage.Disadvantages: Poor service, sometimes the waiter and waiter said why you can't do it by yourself. I have never heard of any other hotels in China.Ctrip's settings are limited to two floors, and no one has notified before."
0,房间很新，床计较舒服，毛巾和床单都是新的，布局比较适合家庭度假。就是服务不够宣称的星级标准。卫生间较小，热水要自己烧，我刚入住的时候没有人提示这一点，害我放了很久凉水之后，问过前台才知道，又等了45分钟后才用上不太热的水洗澡。还有既然适合家庭度假，厨房没有餐具和微波炉，橱柜里比较脏，装修时的垃圾都没清理。整体感觉价位与服务不符。,"The room is very new, the bed is more comfortable, the towels and sheets are new, and the layout is more suitable for family vacations.It is the star -rated standard that is not proclaimed enough.The bathroom is small, and the hot water must be burned by myself. When I first moved, no one prompted this. After I put the cold water for a long time, I asked the front desk to know. After 45 minutes of waiting, I used the less hot water to take a bath.EssenceThere is also a suitable family vacation. There are no tableware and microwave oven in the kitchen. The cabinets are dirty, and the garbage during decoration is not cleaned up.The overall price price does not match the service."
0,该酒店性价比不高，在同类酒店中算差的，房价和24k锦江之星差不多，但各方面都有一定的差距。首先是前台的服务速度不够快，等候时间过长。其次电梯的速度非常之慢，不得不说的是还存在安全隐患，楼梯间的安全门是锁着的，万一出现意外后果不堪设想！最关键的房间（大床房）就是一间毛胚房加一张床，一个电视（有些台还不清楚）。电脑网速一般，建议大家用自带的笔记本，那里的13寸电脑一经开机25元。卫生设备：没有吹风机，毛巾破旧建议更换。杯子少了点，加漱口杯才两个。接下去是晚餐，接连选了4样盖浇饭都说没有（注意：都是普通的诸如雪菜木鱼、茄汁鱼片、红烧大肠）最后端来的两份回锅肉和蚝油牛肉从外观看没有任何区别（青椒+肉片）每份统一价10元。一句话，不建议入住。,"The hotel is not cost -effective. For similar hotels, the house prices are similar to the 24K Jinjiang Star, but there are a certain gap in all aspects.The first is that the service speed of the front desk is not fast enough, and the waiting time is too long.Secondly, the speed of the elevator is very slow. It is necessary to say that there are still hidden dangers. The safety door of the stairwell is locked. In case of accidental consequences!The most critical room (big bed room) is a hair embryo room plus a bed, a TV (some Taiwan is not clear).The speed of the computer is average. It is recommended that you use your own laptop. The 13 -inch computer there is 25 yuan.Sanitary equipment: There are no hair dryers, and the towel is recommended to replace.The cup is a little less, and the mouthwash cup is only two.The next is dinner, and the four -type pouring rice is selected. (Note: Note: It's ordinary two copies of the pot meat and oyster sauce and beef from the appearance from the exterior.Any difference (green pepper+meat slices) a unified price of 10 yuan each.In a word, it is not recommended to check in."
0,坦率地说，我认为云天海湾酒店在面积上有欺诈行为。酒店广告说，标准间B面积为33-37平方米，标准间A为44-47平方米，但7月17日我预订并入住了2号楼1102标准间A，服务员称面积只有30多平方米，后来到楼下售楼处咨询，售楼人员证明，此户型属于G2，37平方米，全价20万左右，购房后每年返还7200元。很明显是广告上说的标准间B，但酒店却以之冒充标准间A，很显然完全没有丝毫诚意。虽然标准间AB价格相差不大，但这样的把戏足可以显示酒店管理者的素质，因此我希望大家在选择时一定要慎而又慎，不要上酒店管理者的当！！！在查看点评时，我发现其他人也反映过类似情况，足在这种以次充好，欺诈消费者的行为，酒店已经不是第一次了！补充点评2008年7月19日：强烈要求酒店对这种面积欺诈行为向全体携程消费者做出解释，并退还相应多收房款！宾馆反馈2008年7月29日：尊敬的宾客您好:首先向您致意十二万分的歉意，对于您在酒店的境遇，我们深感愧咎。酒店房间A/B户型的区分，是以房间面积、户型、朝向、能否观海看河（部分房间）等诸多条件确定的。对于您的投诉，我们通过携程旅行网进行了了解，在A/B房间户型的确认与解释方面是酒店没有交代清楚，对此我们深表歉意。但无论出于什么原因，发生上述事件都是不应该的，过错方在酒店。我们知道，无论怎样解释，也难以平息您的怒气。如果您有时间再次莅临秦皇岛，欢迎您到云天海湾来，酒店将以VIP的规格接待您，对您稍作补偿！希望您能接受。您可以致电酒店网络部留下您的详细联系方式，以便于我们为您提供相应的服务。最后，再次向您致以真诚的歉意，希望您能够接受。祝您工作愉快！！身体健康！！,"Frankly speaking, I think Yuntian Bay Hotel has fraud in area.Hotel advertisements say that the B area of the standard room is 33-37 square meters and the standard room A is 44-47 square meters.Mi, then went to the sales office downstairs to consult. The sales staff proved that this unit belongs to the G2, 37 square meters, and the total price is about 200,000. After buying a house, it will return 7,200 yuan each year.Obviously, it is a standard room B in the advertisement, but the hotel is impersonating the standard room A with it, obviously there is no sincerity at all.Although the price of AB in the standard room is not much different, such a drama can show the quality of the hotel manager. Therefore, I hope that everyone must be cautious and cautious when choosing. Don't go to the hotel manager!IntersectionIntersectionWhen looking at the review, I found that other people have also reflected similar situations. It is not the first time that the hotel has been charging and fraudulent consumers!Supplementary comment on July 19, 2008: It is strongly required to explain to all Campus consumers on this area of fraud, and refund the corresponding more housing funds!Hotel feedback on July 29, 2008: Dear guests: First of all, I apologize to you 120,000 points, and we are deeply ashamed of your situation in the hotel.The distinction of hotel room A/B is determined by many conditions such as room area, apartment, orientation, or whether to watch the sea (some rooms) and other conditions.For your complaints, we have understood through the Ctrip Travel Network. In terms of the confirmation and interpretation of Room A/B, the hotel has not explained clearly, and we apologize for this.But no matter what reason, the above incident should not occur, and the wrong party is in the hotel.We know that no matter how you explain, it is difficult to calm your anger.If you have time to come to Qinhuangdao again, you are welcome to come to Yuntian Bay. The hotel will receive you with the specifications of VIP and compensate for you!Hope you can accept it.You can call the hotel's network department to leave your detailed contact information in order to provide you with corresponding services.Finally, I will give you sincere apology again, hoping that you can accept it.have a pleasant workday!IntersectionIn good health!Intersection"
0,我们是上星期四晚上入住的。没有想到是私人别墅。看得出，老板在硬件上花了功夫。但是，卫生上问题重重。毛巾看得出没有洗干净。洗手间地上的垫子非常脏。还不如不要放得好。如果打算在山上悠闲过一天，看看电视，打打牌。呼吸含氧量高的地方，可以住在山上。否则，太不值得了。服务上根本就不值。山上的野味被他们烧了以后，又油又咸又贵。老板应该知道愿意出钱去住的人，也是对服务有要求的人。只此一次。下次不会去那种山庄。感到受欺骗的感觉。实际上发现周围有许多这样所谓的山庄。不知别人是如何预约的。价钱一定会便宜。对消费者来说，总要物有所值吧。补充点评2007年8月6日：如果点评只有一个，看来是不能具有代表性。下次，我要多看看最近的几个点评。也许会准一些。还好有地方能让我写一些，否则，会误导许多人。,"We stayed in last Thursday.I did not expect to be a private villa.It can be seen that the boss spent effort on hardware.However, hygiene issues are heavy.The towel can be seen without washing.The cushion on the toilet is very dirty.Don't put it well.If you plan to spend a day on the mountain, watch TV and play cards.You can live on the mountain with high oxygen content.Otherwise, it is not worth it.The service is not worth it at all.After the spectacles on the mountain were burned by them, they were oily and expensive.The boss should know that those who are willing to pay for it are also those who have the requirements for the service.Only once.I won't go to that kind of villa next time.Feel the feeling of being deceived.In fact, there are many so -called villas around.I don't know how others make an appointment.The price will definitely be cheap.For consumers, it is always worthwhile.Supplementary comment on August 6, 2007: If there is only one review, it seems that it cannot be representative.Next time, I want to see more recent reviews.Maybe it will be accurate.Fortunately, there is a place to let me write some, otherwise, many people will be misleading."
0,其实住美卡不是第一次，这次算我最失望的一次！一直以来我比较喜欢这个酒店，最近我觉得很差很差．这次住的是豪华房．我真是不知道豪华房是这样的．感觉里面布置真是一个字＂差＂！等我洗澡的时候发现排水是根本就不能排水！满池子都是水，我洗一会出来一会，等着水排完在进去洗，那叫一个痛苦，当时快１２点了，我真不知道是叫人修还是不叫人修理！早晨更加生气，不到９点，一个服务员有敲门有按门铃，结果来了句洗衣服，我说不洗，不到一个小时以后有来一个服务员同样的敲门按门铃，然后来句要打扫房间吗？气的我当时起来，叫了他们经理，他们经理的解释就是，我没有把免打扰的牌子挂出去，我当时晕过去！错误还是怪我了！我没有听过这样的解释．最后他们经理准备送一个杯子给我，我当时就不要，我不知道他们酒店懂不懂中国的传统，送杯子在中国是送悲的意思！然后等他们修水道的修好洗澡走人，我发誓在也不来这个酒店了！还有就是他们的什么牙膏这些东西，简直和以前不能比，差的要命！我真是不知道搞什么，而且他们每个房间用的东西还不一样！真是差加失望！,"In fact, it is not the first time to live in the US card. This time I am the most disappointed!I have always liked this hotel, and recently I feel very bad.This time I lived in a luxury room.I really don't know that the luxury room is like this.It feels that the layout is really a word ""poor""!When I take a bath, I find that the drainage cannot be drained at all!The Manchi was all water. I washed out for a while, waiting for the water to be washed in and washed. It was called a pain. At that time, it was almost 12 o'clock. I really don't know if it was repaired or not to repair it!It was even more angry in the morning. At less than 9 o'clock, a waiter knocked on the door and had a doorbell. As a result, I came to wash clothes. I said it would not wash.Clean the room?I got up at the time and called their managers. The explanation of their manager was that I did not hang out the signless sign. I was faint at the time!I still blame me!I have never heard of this explanation.In the end, their manager was preparing to give me a cup. I didn't want it at the time. I don't know if their hotel understands the Chinese tradition. Sending a cup in China means sadness!Then when they repaired the waterway to take a bath, I vowed not to come to this hotel anymore!There are what toothpastes they are, which is not comparable to before, terrible!I really don't know what to do, and what they use in each room is not the same!It's really disappointed!"
0,酒店卫生服务较好，但代销的“长城一日游”是家黑旅行社，上车加钱签协议，协议上盖有XX假日旅行社的条形章，无公章和发票，黑心导游自称姓青，车尾号是564，行程时间7：30-10：30，实际登长城时间为1.5小时，昭陵0.5小时，其余时间全部被黑导忽悠“购物”和误导性消费。。。以后再也不住西翠了，想起来就恶心，西翠以前不是这样的啊。,"The hotel's health services are good, but the ""Great Wall Day Tour"" of the agency is a black travel agency.The rear number is 564, the itinerary is 7: 30-10: 30. The actual time to the Great Wall is 1.5 hours, Zhaoling is 0.5 hours, and the rest of the time is ""shopping"" and misleading consumption.EssenceEssenceIn the future, Xicui will never be held, and it will be disgusting when I think of it. Xi Cui was not like this before."
0,便宜没好货!!可能用来当作炮房还嫌周围环境噪音太大!,It is cheap and no good !! It may be used as a gun room. It is too noisy for the surrounding environment!
0,对这个酒店的整体我不想多评论什么，希望携程在今后找合作酒店的时候多把把关。,I don't want to comment on this hotel as a whole. I hope Ctrip will check more when looking for a cooperative hotel in the future.
0,太差了还算国际连锁弄的跟街边店一样的电视没遥控器热水器冷水热水标致相反的害的我开了很久也没出热水房间被子看上去很恶心总之这种饭店呆一次就不会再去了。,"It's too bad, it's still the same as the international chain, as the TV shop without a remote control water heater, the cold water heater is the opposite, I opened it for a long time, and I didn't have hot water. The quilt looked disgusting.I won't go again."
0,我第一次住如家就是在南昌八一广场店，但是相当的不愉快。首先两部电梯只有一部是共如家使用的，隔音效果相当差，晚上晚一点周围房间的冲凉水生让人睡不好。最让我接受不了的是那里某些员工的态度，如家在房卡后面写可以申请延时退房，开始我没仔细问，第二天上午出去办事以为可以很快回来，没想到等客户等了很久，因此在十点多的时候打电话回去问了一下，他们说不可以。我之后匆忙和客户聊了两句回去退房，但是还是晚了几分钟但是前台的人冷言冷语的，还说什么没收我延时退房的房费已经很帮忙了。我承认我是晚退了几分钟房可他们的一部电梯也让我等了不少时间。对于如家这样的服务态度我真的没什么话说，所以以后我是绝对不会再入住如家了。,"For the first time, I lived in the Bayi Plaza in Nanchang, but it was quite unpleasant.First of all, only one of the two elevators was used in common, and the sound insulation effect was quite poor. The showering aquatic surrounding rooms at night made people sleep well.What makes me most unacceptable is the attitude of some employees there. For example, if you write behind the house card, you can apply for a delay to check out. At the beginning, I didn't ask carefully. I thought I could come back soon the next morning.After a long time, I called back at more than ten o'clock, and they said no.I hurriedly talked to the customer and went back to check out a few words, but it was a few minutes late, but the people at the front desk were cold and cold. I also said that I confiscated that I had a time -delayed check -out room fee.I admit that I took a few minutes late to the room but one of their elevators also made me wait a lot.I really have nothing to say about the service attitude of Rujia, so I will never stay in Rujia in the future."
0,平心而论，这个价位这个房间应该还算不错的，如果我没有碰到下面的几件事情的话：1、拿到房卡到了房间，居然是没有打扫过的2、房门的锁发生了两次故障（锁不上，从外面不用钥匙就可以打开），虽然服务员很快就修好了，但，总是让人怕怕的3、宾馆主楼的一道边门直接连着通往公园的通道，但居然门大开却没有任何门卫和安保措施，从这道门可以直接到二楼客房的走廊。虽然走廊上有探头，但这样的安全措施总让人不放心。4、个人感觉餐厅菜太贵，一盘糖醋排骨要68元，没敢点。（如果要求不高的话，早上的自助餐还可以）宾馆反馈2008年8月1日：对于您在本酒店的不愉快经历我们深表歉意！感谢您对我们提出的宝贵意见。您提出的第四点，这道菜的价格是略高于市场，我们已经进行了调整，对于携程客户我们餐厅是有优惠政策的，点菜结帐时可给予88折优惠，您只要出示房卡证明您是携程客户即可；您提出的关于安全措施方面的忧虑我们能理解，但是请您放心，我们对您的安全是有保证的。我们的保安是流动巡视（边门是安全通道出口），而且我们的监控室按公安部门的要求，是24小时在岗监控，宾馆在安全方面是实行外松内紧；您提出的第一点，很抱歉可能是我们与导游的沟通协调没有到位。因您是上午入住酒店，而一般宾客的退房时间是中午12：00之前。周五都是满房，周六上午入住，房间一般都没打扫好。这点我们事先会和客人或者导游说明情况，行李可以先入房间，但清扫有一个时间段。在您这点上，我们和巴士班的沟通可能出了问题，请您原谅我们的过失。再次感谢您提出的宝贵意见，希望我们能有机会再为您服务，消除您本次入住的不愉快经历！,"In all fairness, this room should be pretty good. If I have not encountered the following things: 1. I got the room card to the room, and there was no cleaning.(Can't be locked, you can open it without a key from the outside.) Although the waiter was repaired soon, it was always scared. 3. The side door of the main building of the hotel directly connected to the passage of the park, but the door was actually the door.There is no gatekeeper and security measures. From this door, you can go directly to the corridor on the second -floor guest room.Although there is a probe on the corridor, such security measures are always uneasy.4. Personally feel that the restaurant is too expensive. A plate of sweet and sour pork ribs cost 68 yuan.(If the requirements are not high, the buffet in the morning is also available) Hotel feedback on August 1, 2008: We apologize for your unpleasant experience in this hotel!Thank you for your valuable opinions.The fourth point you put forward is that the price of this dish is slightly higher than the market. We have adjusted it. There are preferential policies for Ctrip customers and our restaurant. You can give 88 % discount when ordering.You can just be a Ctrip customer; we can understand the worries about security measures, but please rest assured that we have a guarantee for your safety.Our security guards are mobile inspections (the side door is exported by the safety channel), and our monitoring room is monitored in the job in 24 hours according to the requirements of the public security department.Sorry for our communication and coordination with tour guides.Because you enter the hotel in the morning, and the general guest's check -out time is before 12:00 noon.On Friday, there are full rooms, and on Saturday morning, the rooms are generally not cleaned.We will explain the situation with the guests or tour guides in advance. Luggage can enter the room first, but there is a time period for cleaning.In your point, we may have a problem with the communication with the bus class. Please forgive our faults.Thank you again for your valuable opinions. I hope we can have the opportunity to serve you again and eliminate your unpleasant experience of your stay!"
0,虽然是四星级的酒店，但是房间内部装修比一般宾馆还差，但服务员的服务还是不错。宾馆反馈2008年7月10日：赵王宾馆有普通间、标准间、商务间、套间等多种房型，目前，大部分普通间已经完成升级改造，携程客户预订普通间享受免费升级到新改造房型的优惠。,"Although it is a four -star hotel, the interior decoration of the room is worse than ordinary hotels, but the serviceman's service is still good.Hotel feedback on July 10, 2008: Zhao Wang Hotel has a variety of room types such as ordinary rooms, standard rooms, business rooms, and suite rooms.

0,"服务较好,但设施不是一般的差。1、电话每次都要试很多次才通，甚至打总台都是这样。更不用提打出去了。2、浴室的抽风没有作用，衣服只能通过开空调才能干。3、室内潮湿，无除湿措施。4、洗脸盆和浴室的下水经常堵。补充点评2008年7月3日：4、酒店不备药。我7月2日下午18：30左右已经有低烧，不仅没有备用药，且附近没有药房总台的回答是：去南浦大桥附近的医院。5、携程的价格不具有优势，和洒店的价格一样。下次不会再住了。","The service is better, but the facilities are not general.1. Try many times each time the phone, and even call the main station.Not to mention it.2. The wind in the bathroom has no effect, and the clothes can only be dried through the air conditioner.3. Indoor humidity, no dehumidification measures.4. Washing and bathrooms are often blocked.Supplementary review July 3, 2008: 4. The hotel is not prepared.I had a low fever at around 18:30 pm on July 2nd. Not only did there not be spare medicines, but there was no response from the Pharmacy Head of the Pharmacy: I went to the hospital near Nanpu Bridge.5. Ctrip's price does not have an advantage, the same as the price of Saodian.I won't live again next time."
0,住过得最烂的酒店，房间隔音非常不好，隔壁电视机声音、走廊人说话声音和开关们声音都非常大，倒霉的是赶上一拨旅行团，晚上有人喝多了大声喧哗还打架，简直没办法睡觉。最让人难以忍受的是晚上11点左右多次有电话打过来问需不需要特殊服务，太可怕了！以后倒找钱都不会住了。,"For the most bad hotels, the room sounds very bad. The sound of the TV, the sound of the corridor, the sound of the corridor and the switch sound are very loud. The unlucky is to catch up with a tour group.There is no way to sleep.The most unbearable thing is that there are many calls around 11 o'clock in the evening to ask if you need special services, it is terrible!I won't live in the future."
0,旧楼改建的酒店，期望不要太高。酒店经理的态度很好，会帮助解决问题。有一位前台小姐的态度实在是不敢恭维，可以说恶劣,"The hotel re -rebuilt, expect not to be too high.The hotel manager's attitude is very good and will help solve the problem.There is a lady at the front desk, and I dare not compliment. It can be said that it is bad."

If the hair dryer was used, there was a problem and I couldn't return it to the original place. I called the head station to find someone to see.I rushed out and explained it again to the main station. I returned to the hotel at about 12 o'clock in the evening, but I was still old. I don’t know if no one came to see it, or they couldn't do it. The next day, I checked out.There are three people in their main station, but I feel all together, and the operation is very unprofessional. This is far from the standard of 3 stars.

In short, I won't choose this hotel again next time."
0,"5月2号入住该酒店,是我们自使用携程预定酒店以来入住的最糟糕的一个酒店.酒店的服务水平能够2星就不错.酒店设施极为陈旧,除床上用品是入住前换过,其他物品不堪入目,实在不敢恭维.酒店的收费用品到是提供的很全,各式各样.但是一般酒店的基本配备在这都被省略了.没有拖鞋,没有毛巾(不管客人是否使用,应是最起码的配备).地毯黑黑的,简直让人难受.第二天我们下午5点回到酒店时,房间卫生都没有打扫,给客房部打电话,结果告之当天退房的客人太多,还没顾上打扫呢.我简直要被这番话吓晕过去.总之以后在也不能住这家酒店了.也强烈要求携程不要再将这种烂酒店推荐给你们的上帝了.","Checking into the hotel on May 2 is the worst hotel we have stayed in the hotel since using Ctrip.

If you contact the phone, you can put it more!IntersectionIt ’s cold at eleven o'clock, angry, I still sent someone to watch it!Wait until 11:30, one word!The small hotel is not as good as that the room is also dirty. The bedside table on one side is fell off on the wall. The TV is every table with snowflakes.What else to say about the Samsung standard, the small room cannot turn around.Can't live anyway!"
0,酒店房间太脏了，我刷牙的时候差点没吐了，，他们的水龙头上都是污垢，浴缸里有的地方都生锈了，唉，我睡觉的时候看到他们的被罩没有套紧，里面的东西都露出来了。地毯也不清洁，屋子里有股味道。,"The hotel room was too dirty. I almost didn't vomit when I brushed my teeth. The faucet was all dirt, and some of the places in the bathtub were rusty. Alas, when I was sleeping, I saw that their quilt was not tight.Everything is exposed.The carpet is not clean, and the room has a flavor in the room."
0,酒店地理位置较好，离南京西路近在咫尺，但是酒店的设施太过简陋，商务酒店之名不符实。。。,"The hotel has a good geographical location, close to Nanjing West Road, but the hotel's facilities are too rude, and the name of a business hotel is not true.EssenceEssence"
0,我是在正月住过的，感觉装修不错，但是服务一般！感觉服务员服务很是没有培训好！早点吃的也不是很舒服，吃的东西不是冷的就是半热！现在去太仓在看他们房间价格比过年的时候贵２倍，太仓宾馆的房价太高！,"I have lived in the first month. I feel that the decoration is good, but the service is average!It feels that the waiter's service is very well trained!Eating early is not very comfortable, what you eat is either cold or semi -hot!Now go to Taicang to see that the price of their room is twice as expensive when the New Year, and the house price of Taicang Hotel is too high!"
0,不太满意，有天晚上十点半回来，没有热水，忍了，第二天早晨还是没有热水，打电话去总台问了三四次，才知道是煤气公司停气。酒店至少应该提前通知吧，这是夏天！！！还有我出去办事，LP在楼下上网，用了大约十分钟左右，有工作人员出来让她不要用了，说这个电脑是给商务人员用的，可能是我LP长得像小孩，我住了好多家汉庭从来没有听说电脑是商务人员用的。还有个题外话，前两天我是用南航会员卡直接预订入住的，因前台人员不会操作或操作失误，导致我第一天的活动里程无法累计，前台理直气壮的说不能补！我只能说，这家汉庭是我住过的汉庭中最烂的。,"I was not very satisfied. I came back at 10:30 in the evening without hot water. I endured it. The next morning, there was no hot water. I called the head station three or four times before I knew it was the gas company to stop the gas.The hotel should at least notify in advance, this is summer!IntersectionIntersectionAnd I went out to do business. LP went downstairs and took about ten minutes. Some staff came out to let her not use it. It is said that this computer is for business personnel. Maybe I LP looks like a child. I liveMany Hanting never heard that computers were used by business personnel.There is also an outsourcing. I used the China Southern Airlines Member Card to book in the past two days. Because the front desk staff did not operate or make mistakes, my first day's mileage could not be accumulated. The front desk was straightforward and could not make up!I can only say that this Han Ting is the worst in the Han Ting I have lived."
0,房间太小。设施太简单。服务太冷淡。不会再住。,The room is too small.The facilities are too simple.The service is too cold.Will not live again.
0,这是我在携程遇到过的最差的酒店，问题多多1.这大冷天的。房间塑钢窗密封性极差，四处漏风，第二天换了个房间，也漏，不过比上一间漏的小点，联系服务员，服务员跟我说你自己拿透明胶条把缝粘粘就行2.暖气不热。服务员告知本酒店采用地暖方式，我一点没体会到地暖的优越性，在房间呆着需要靠羽绒服保暖，晚上睡觉需要盖2床被子3.浴室里淋浴的水时冷时热。水及不稳定，又时候冰你一下，有时候烫你一下4.房间里的空调禁止使用。从一进屋我就开始找空调遥控器，没找到，遂联系服务员，被告知由于我店采用地暖，空调暖风可以不用，遥控器由酒店统一保管。几经交涉终于把遥控器要到手了。。想要点暖风真不容易啊5.饭菜质量差。18一位的自助午餐，要了一份猪蹄，刚吃几口发现猪蹄上还有好多没拔干净的毛。。。。。宾馆反馈2008年6月10日：1、关于用水：经过我们认真的检查，我们最终确定造成洗浴水温波动的主要原因是冷水的压力变动。邯郸市自来水管网中的水压在用水峰谷压力不稳定，酒店专用自来水入户表井口径是50的，用水量不够使用。我们采取了以下措施：1、向邯郸市自来水公司申请扩容，安装直径100的入户表井，保证用水量，目前已完成。在管网中增加自动管道加压泵，保证恒定的管网压力，目前已完成。3、增加管网末端稳压水箱，体积3.3立方。经过以上措施彻底保证管网压力稳定。2、关于窗体密封：关于部分双层隔音窗密封问题，我酒店积极和施工单位进行协调，采取方法加以改善：更换部分窗扇的密封条。修复损坏失效的五金件。对窗体和楼体的接触部分，从内部进行密封胶密封，从外部进行玻璃胶密封。以上措施，业已落实到位，效果明显。3、关于地采暖：对于燕赵之星开业以来的第一个冬季，我们在取暖工作上的确出现了一些问题。首先是，我们对采暖系统的操作上经验不足，设备运能不能完全发挥，对此，我们积极联系厂家和专业维修人员进行设备调试。另外我们对具体操作的员工进行了调整和培训，制定完善了操作规程，明确了岗位责任。同时，我们对原煤供货商进行了调整，采购热能更高，更加洁净的白煤用于取暖。对于我们前一个采暖季节出现的问题，再次对各位信任我们的朋友，致以真诚的歉意，希望大家能再次信任我们。4、我们将继续努力：以上都是在燕赵之星商务酒店开业过程中，我们所面临的困难。随着燕赵之星步入第二个经营年，各项设施设备的完善，人员配备和培训的加强，我们正在全面的解决这些问题。感谢始终关注我们的各位朋友，您的批评指正是我们前进的动力。我们乐于通过自己的努力，为各位朋友在邯郸市营建一个温馨的家。,"This is the worst hotel I have encountered in Ctrip. There are many problems 1. This is a cold day.The plastic steel windows in the room are very poor, leakage everywhere, and changed the room the next day, and also leaked, but than the previous leakage, contact the waiter, the waiter told me that you can stick to the sewing of the sewing by yourself.2. The heating is not hot.The waiter informed the hotel's use of ground heating. I did not realize the superiority of ground heating. In the room, I needed to keep warm in the room. I need to cover 2 beds at night. 3. The water in the bathroom was cold and hot.Water and instability, you will be frozen again, sometimes you hot. 4. The air conditioners in the room are prohibited.I started to find the air conditioner remote control from the time of entering the house. I did not find it. I contacted the waiter. I was told that because my store used floor heating, the air -conditioning warm air could not be used. The remote control was kept by the hotel.After several negotiations, the remote control was finally available.EssenceIt's not easy to order warm wind 5. Poor food quality.18 buffet lunch, I asked for a trotter. I just ate a few mouthfuls and found that there were still a lot of hair on the trotters.EssenceEssenceEssenceEssenceHotel feedback on June 10, 2008: 1. Regarding water usage: After careful inspection, we finally determined that the main reason for the fluctuation of the temperature fluctuations of the bath water is the pressure of cold water.The water pressure in Handan Water Pipeline Network is unstable in the pressure of water peak valley. The caliber of the hotel's tap water entering the house is 50, and the amount of water is not enough.We have taken the following measures: 1. Apply to Handan Water Company to expand capacity, install a household well with 100 diameter to ensure that the amount of water consumption is currently completed.Added automatic pipe pressure pumps to the pipe network to ensure the constant pipe network pressure, which is currently completed.3. Increase the at the end of the pipe network to stabilize the water tank, with a volume of 3.3 cubic meters.After the above measures, the pressure of the pipe network is thoroughly guaranteed.2. Regarding the window seal: Regarding the problem of some double -layer sound insulation windows, our hotel actively coordinated with the construction unit to improve the method: replace the sealing strip of part of the fan fan.Fix the damaged hardware.The contact part of the window and the body is seal from the inside and seal from the outside.The above measures have been implemented in place, and the effect is obvious.3. About ground heating: For the first winter since the opening of Yan Zhaoxing, we did have some problems in heating work.First of all, we have lack of experience in the operation of the heating system, and whether the equipment transportation can be fully played. In this regard, we actively contact manufacturers and professional maintenance personnel for equipment debugging.In addition, we have adjusted and train specific employees, formulated and improved operating procedures, and clarified job responsibilities.At the same time, we have adjusted the supplier of the raw coal, the purchase thermal energy is higher, and the cleaner white coal is used for heating.Regarding the problems that occurred in the previous heating season, we will have a sincere apologies to trust our friends and sincerely. I hope everyone can trust us again.4. We will continue to work hard: the above is the difficulties we face during the opening of Yan Zhaozhixing's business hotel.As Yan Zhaozhixing enters the second year of operation, the improvement of various facilities and equipment, and the strengthening of personnel equipment and training, we are comprehensively solving these problems.Thanks to your friends who are always concerned about us, your criticism means that it is our motivation to move forward.We are happy to build a warm home for friends in Handan City through our own efforts."
0,房间满干净的，入住时态度也不错，但是有一件事的却改变了我对此酒店的印象，因为退房后充电器落在房间，提前也给前台打过电话让他们去下来放在前台我来取，谁知到了以后他们一直让我等，我等了又十分钟左右，他们又说让我上去自己取，住在8楼，楼上打扫房间的阿姨帮我取了，结果那天就因为这事差点没赶上飞机，难道说退房后的服务变得如此的,"The room is clean and the attitude is also good when I check in, but one thing has changed my impression on this hotel, because the charger fell in the room after checkout, and I called the front desk in advance for them to go down to the front desk and put it on the front desk.I come to take it, who knows that they will always let me wait, I waited for about ten minutes, they said that I asked me to take it to myself and live on the 8th floor. The aunt who cleaned the room upstairs helped me take it.Because I almost didn't catch the plane on this matter, is it that the service after checking out"

0,唉，简直是一无是处，我住的大床房，小得只能放下一张床，房间里的矿泉水还是过期的，没住过这么烂的如家，可能145元就活该如此了。对那些住宿稍微有些想法的人，不建议入住。,"Alas, it ’s almost useless. The big bed room I live in is so small that I can only put down a bed.

The smallest toilet in the hotel where I lived. It is smaller than the hotel bathroom in Hong Kong.There are no. In the morning, I ordered the room for meals, and the amount was very small. It was not delicious. It was even more dizzy to call a taxi when I went out. A five -star hotel in the dignitaries had waited for more than 20 minutes to wait for the taxi.The road next to it was repaired, but the aircraft did not catch up with the airport. It was too depressed. I won't live in this broken hotel in the future. No wonder there are so few people!"
0,建议携程的用户不要定这家酒店，因为这家酒店缺乏诚信，你入住了他对携程说你没有入住，希望增加积分的就不要定了，而且还随意调换你的房间。,"It is recommended that Ctrip users do not decide this hotel, because the hotel lacks integrity. You stay in him and told Ctrip that you do not stay. If you want to increase your points, you should not be fixed, and you also change your room at will."
0,一个垃圾酒店，徒有其表。完全不管住客的安全，供住客使用的浴巾居然有血迹，恐怖啊，不知道其他的地方是否消过毒，如果染上什么病，真是跳到黄河都洗不清啊。对你的投诉置之不理。服务素质极差。总之再不会住这家酒店及其分店了。,"A garbage hotel has its own table.Regardless of the safety of the guests, the bath towels used for residents are actually blood, horrible. I do n’t know if other places are disinfected. If you are stained, you ca n’t wash it to the Yellow River.Ignore your complaint.The service quality is extremely poor.In short, I won't live in this hotel and its branches."
0,听朋友说这家酒店是新装修的，装修的确挺新的。房间里面也挺简洁。只是房间隔音效果很差，对门放的电视声音都可以听到，所以基本没有休息好。早餐很一般。如果去安大和中国科技大学，这家酒店地理位置有优势，步行10分钟即到。,"I heard a friend say that this hotel is newly renovated, and the decoration is indeed new.The room is also very simple.It ’s just that the sound insulation effect of the room is very poor. You can hear the sound of the TV playback, so there is basically no rest.Breakfast is very average.If you go to Ontario and the University of Science and Technology of China, this hotel has an advantage in geographical location, and it will arrive in walking for 10 minutes."
0,"房间小的可怜,写字台前如果放个椅子那就和床是零距离了.服务很差,凌晨3点多前台服务员同客人吵架约一个小时,整个楼道房客都无法休息,也许对方是无理取闹,但是事后酒店并没有向客人说明情况并道歉,把所有责任都推给对方,总之长沙之行很失望,小地方毕竟是小地方,但是反过来讲,湖南台办的还是不错的.","The small room is pitiful. If you put a chair in front of the office, it is zero -distance from the bed. The service is very poor. At 3 am, the front desk waiter quarreled with the guests for about an hour.Afterwards, the hotel did not explain the situation to the guests and apologized, and pushed all the responsibilities to the other party. In short, the trip to Changsha was disappointed. After all, the small place was a small place, but in turn, the Hunan Taiwan Office was still good."
0,宾馆直接对外的价格是168，携程的价格是160，只便宜8元，有点喜剧,"The direct price of the hotel is 168, the price of Ctrip is 160, only 8 yuan cheaper, a bit comedy"
0,酒店从价格来讲还算便宜。但前台有特价房68，而在携程只能顶到98的，这一点我接受不了。酒店服务还算不错，只是周边的配套不足。,"In terms of price, the hotel is cheap.But there are special rooms at the front desk, and I can only reach 98 in Ctrip. I can't accept this.The hotel service is pretty good, but the surrounding facilities are insufficient."

0,没酒店住，又住了一次。小姐骚扰从8点一次，变成两次，晚上9点多，和12点多。都睡觉了，气到想报警。前台告诉我，这个不是酒店责任。真搞笑，其他酒店都没有小姐骚扰，就华侨小姐上窜下跳，比老鼠还厉害。这次还有女同事同行，而隔壁房间的女同事没有接到任何骚扰电话。我该佩服小姐的智商还是该骂酒店卖客人呢？,"No hotel live, and lived again.Miss harassing from 8 o'clock to twice, more than 9 o'clock in the evening, and more than 12 o'clock.I'm sleeping, so I want to call the police.The front desk tells me that this is not a hotel responsibility.Really funny, there are no ladies harassing other hotels, and they jumped up and down on Miss Overseas Chinese, which is better than mice.This time there were also female colleagues walking, and the female colleague next door did not receive any harassment calls.Should I admire Miss's IQ or should I scold the hotel to sell guests?"

0,春节期间住了一晚，房价高不说，房间内的空调只能制冷不能制热。第二天的早饭更是惨不忍睹，我们8点多到的楼下，一楼转角一个小的不能再小的餐厅，粥、面条都已经空了，就剩下两个鸡蛋，两片方肉。后面还有不少人陆续来餐厅，前面在用餐的还没吃饱，大厨说再下面条。所谓面条也就是长长的方便面而已。这家酒店是这次出行住宿中最差的一家。,"I lived for one night during the Spring Festival, and the house prices were high. The air conditioners in the room could only cool down and heated.The breakfast the next day was even more terrible. When we arrived downstairs at 8 o'clock, a small restaurant on the first floor could not be smaller. The porridge and noodles were empty. There were two eggs and two square meters.There are many people who come to the restaurant one after another.

0,今年的5.1、10.1长假分别定了西安与重庆的如家，非常失望，如家简直无诚信可言。这里把我的遭遇简单描述，希望能给各位出行的朋友提供借鉴。5.1西安的如家严重超定，我们一行11人险些露宿街头，与酒店交涉了2个小时，原定的4间房，只拿到3间。同时到达酒店的不少客人，因无房可住，只得带着行李走人。9月14日通过携程携程定了10.5日如家的上清寺店，吸取了5.1教训，于10.5日下午用信用卡做了付款担保，到达酒店，办理了信用卡预受权，莫名的签了好几份入住单（在酒店坚决要签的情况下），拿到房卡时才发现，原定的2套商务大床房被换成了标房和大床房，酒店除了说“抱歉、房已满”再也没有任何解释。对房间的大小、设施没有过高的要求，毕竟是经济型酒店，最让人受不了的是，其中的一间房臭气熏天，请服务员弄了3次，仍旧臭。无语......,"This year's 5.1 and 10.1 long holidays set the Rulai and Chongqing, which are very disappointed. Rujia is simply no integrity.Here I briefly describe my encounter, hoping to provide reference to friends who travel.5.1 The home of Xi'an is seriously overwhelming. We all stayed on the streets and negotiated with the hotel for 2 hours. The original 4 rooms were only obtained.At the same time, many guests who arrived at the hotel had to live with their luggage because they had no house.On September 14th, I set up the 10.5 -day Shangqing Temple store through Ctrip, and learned 5.1 lessons. On the afternoon of 10.5, I used a credit card to guarantee the guarantee. At the hotel, I went to the hotel and handled the credit card pre -acceptance.(When the hotel is determined), when I got the room card, I found out that the original two large -scale large -scale large -scale bedrooms were replaced by a standard room and a large bed room. In addition to saying ""sorry, the room is full""There is no explanation.There are no requirements for the size and facilities of the room. After all, it is a economy hotel.

0,入住的当天02-26日，房间828。这个房间紧邻着一个下水管道，整夜的流水，难以入睡，我只有睡另外一张离下水管较远的单人床用被捂着脑袋入睡。从27日期直到3月2日，我每天都在和前台交涉需要更换一个房间，每天都答应但是每天都没有解决。3月1日前台有个个子不高（172CM）、戴眼镜、方脸型、短头发、黑西服的一个貌似领班的男士答应给我解决，但是未果。第二天，2日12时左右打电话到房间告诉我有房间但是在打扫，等......。14时左右再次打电话到房间告知有房间但是还在打扫，继续等......。19时终于再次告知我，终于可以换房了（换到818。难道贵公司举办的做床比赛就体现了这么个工作效率？难以置信！），但是房间明显没有828面积大。无所谓了，只要能睡个好觉也无所谓了。3月3日8:20退房。也许你们会很奇怪的在想：既然酒店一而再，再而三的不给你换房，你为什么不换一家酒店呢？其实我在到乌鲁木齐之前准备订锦江之星酒店的，但是他们还在建设之中，即将开业。所以我通过携程网站找到了你们这家商务酒店，看到你们的介绍我觉得和锦江之星也是类似的酒店，能够提供舒适、干净的环境，更重要的是能够给我们这样的商务人士提供高速的宽带接入。因此我定下了你们的酒店，但是入住之后却让我感觉到了你们和锦江之星之间服务上的明显差距，很少有员工跟我们主动的、面带微笑的问候，早餐的环境和品种（吃了6天早餐只有一道菜有变化）惟一能让我忍受度过这几天的就是你们的床和室内装修环境要略胜锦江之星，其次可能就是宽带了。仅此而已。其实这些过去也就过去了，让我感到气愤的是今天收到携程网站的一条短信“{携程}八音和速8酒店，原订到3月3日，酒店告知27日已退房。如不符请速致电携程，以免漏算您的积分”。酒店的诚信何在？？？为了少向携程交付佣金就犯下这样低级的、没有智商的错误。我认为这样的员工可以解雇，因为他不知道欺骗了一个消费者，欺骗了一个自己的客户会带来怎样的后果，会给公司带来怎样的不利影响。我真诚的希望“乌鲁木齐八音和速8”这家酒店的经理（老板）能在24小时之内给我致歉，以挽回这家酒店的声誉，以挽回“速8”这个国际连锁酒店的声誉。现在是网络的时代，我可以通过网站、个人空间、博客等传播媒介撰写每天发生在我身上的事情，也可以利用我给同事、下属、伙伴公司培训的机会讲讲这些活生生的案例。我花费了宝贵的时间写了这封价值连城的投诉信想必你们一定会有所反映。现在是北京时间3月4日10:40补充点评2008年3月4日：投诉八音和速8酒店而非携程网站。宾馆反馈2008年4月9日：尊敬的客人您好，八音和速8酒店非常感谢您提出的宝贵意见，同时也深表感激！您的意见能够帮助我们更好的完善服务，对于您在本酒店的入住经历除了向您表示歉意之外并真诚的向您发出邀请：希望您能再次入住本酒店！此事件的相关责任人已经接受了处理意见并希望通过这次交往，能够和您真诚的成为好朋友。我们将盛情款待来自远方的您，期待您来新疆的旅程继续支持八音和速8酒店，我们携手同进！祝您身体健康，万事顺意！,"On the day of staying at 02-26, the room 828.This room is close to a sewer pipe, and it is difficult to fall asleep all night. I only have to sleep with another single -person bed far away from the water pipe and fall asleep with my head covered with my head.From the 27th to March 2, I need to change a room with the front desk for negotiations every day. I promised every day but I did not solve it every day.On March 1st, there were not high (172cm) at the front desk, wearing glasses, square faces, short hair, and a man who seemed to be a foreman, but he promised me to solve it, but it did not work.The next day, I called at around 12:00 on the 2nd to tell me that there was a room but was cleaning, waiting ...At about 14 o'clock, I called the room again to tell the room but still cleaned, and continue to wait ...At 19:00, I told me again that I could finally change the house (changed to 818.

It is incredible!), But the room is obviously not 828 large.It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter if you can sleep well.March 3rd at 8:20.Maybe you will be very strange: Since the hotel will not change the house again, why don't you change a hotel?In fact, I was going to book the Jinjiang Star Hotel before I arrived at Urumqi, but they were still under construction and were about to open.So I found your business hotel through the Ctrip website. Seeing your introduction, I think it is also a similar hotel as Jinjiang Star. It can provide a comfortable and clean environment. More importantly, it can provide us with high -speed business people such as us such as us.Broadband access.So I set off your hotel, but after check -in, I felt the obvious gap between you and Jinjiang Star. Few employees greeting and smiling greetings with us, the environment and variety of breakfast (the breakfast environment and variety (After 6 days of breakfast, only one dish has changed) The only thing that allows me to endure through these days is that your bed and indoor decoration environment must be slightly better than Jinjiang Star, followed by broadband.That's it.In fact, these pasts have passed. What makes me feel angry is that I received a text message from the Ctrip website today ""{Ctrip} Eight Voice and Speed 8 Hotel. It was originally scheduled to be on March 3, and the hotel informed the 27th out of check -in.Please call Ctrip if you do not match, so as not to miss your points.

0,服务的态度还可以，只是我住的那间房实在是太太太小了（大床房）。,"The attitude of the service is okay, but the room I lived in was really small (big bed room)."
0,服务很差，晚上竟然停电了2-3个小时。周边很荒凉。房间里面一张圆床占了很大面积，其他都显得很拥挤，床头边上就是洗手池，头顶对着淋浴房和马桶！设计很不合理！,"The service was very poor, and the power output was 2-3 hours at night.The surroundings are desolate.A round bed in the room occupied a large area, and the others were very crowded. The pool was washed on the front of the bed, and the head facing the shower room and toilet!The design is very unreasonable!"
0,每天晚上十点多开始有人唱KTV，前台说要一直唱到两点，如果你有非常强大抗干扰能力，就来吧补充点评2007年11月19日：深更半夜的，被KTV打扰，只有自己换房一个选择，还要穿上衣服，拿,"Every night at 10 o'clock in the evening, some people sing KTV. The front desk said that it will be sang to two o'clock. If you have a very strong anti -interference ability, come on the comments on November 19, 2007: Deep in the middle of the night, you are disturbed by KTV, only you can change it yourself.A choice of room, but also put on clothes, take it"
0,7点到了酒店前台打电话问了楼层说房间可以入住，上楼竟然房间的垃圾成堆根本就没有打扫，下楼要求换房间竟说没有了，只是让楼层打扫卫生，等了半个钟头竟然还没有打扫出来，后来来了个头头模样的，问他你们怎么半个多钟头房间都打扫不出来，他让前台换房间，这时前台一点咯噔也没打房间马上有了（看来刚开始前台是撒谎了）。到房间一看，竟然被罩还是脏的，又让服务员换了。总的来说前台不够尽职，有房间不给调（扯谎说没有），真是非常令人不愉快的经历。补充点评2008年2月5日：是晚上七点,"At 7 o'clock, I called the front desk of the hotel and asked the floor to say that the room could stay in. The garbage in the room in the room did not clean up at all. I asked the room to change the room.I haven't cleaned it yet, and then I came up with a head, and asked him how you couldn't clean up the room for more than half an hour. He asked the front desk to change the room. At this timeThe front desk is lying).When I saw it in the room, I was still dirty, and the waiter changed.In general, the front desk is not due to due diligence, and there is no room for room (no lies), which is really unpleasant.Supplementary comment February 5, 2008: 7 o'clock in the evening"
0,住的是一楼，房间太小，窗户对着一堵墙。以后不会再住它了,"It is the first floor, the room is too small, and the window is facing a wall.I won't live again in the future"
0,该酒店无论硬件还是软件都达不到4星级。院内停车要交费，房间小，装修档次低，房间床和电视机等档次太低，卫生间小且配套用品品种少档次低。与420元豪华房间价格及4星级酒店标准差距太大。如果挂牌4星，山东旅游局相关人员肯定受贿了。给曲阜，给山东丢脸，有骗人之嫌。,"The hotel does not reach 4 stars, both hardware and software.Parking in the courtyard must be paid, the room is small, the decoration level is low, the room bed and the TV and other grades are too low, the bathrooms are small, and the variety of supporting supplies is low.The difference between the price of 420 yuan luxury room and the standard of 4 -star hotels is too large.If you are listed in 4 stars, the relevant personnel of the Shandong Tourism Bureau will definitely accept bribes.For Qufu, embarrassing Shandong is deceiving."
0,周边环境差，房间卫生差，房间设施老旧，服务差（接送车辆接送不到位，电话接不通，卫生设备损坏不维修）。,"The surrounding environment is poor, the room is poor, the room facilities are old, and the service is poor (the connection vehicle is not available, the phone cannot be connected, and the sanitary equipment is damaged and not repaired)."
0,携程的宾馆预订，大大不如从前了，价格没有优势，协议的酒店提供的服务跟携程的承诺大打折扣！！！到达酒店的时候，原来预订时的价格是188元，可是到酒店后，酒店临时调整价格到268元（公布价是358元），问我同意不同意？废话，我能同意吗？在入住的时候，就要交房费，以前真没见过。房间的安全性差，没有内锁。因为刚刚装修完，所以，房间设备虽然低档次，但是还算是新的，感觉不是太差。洗涑用品连招待所的都不如，还什么大酒店？管子里出来的是黄黄的水！！！入住的时候，本来说是可以刷VISA卡的，可是刷不了。（不知道有没有真把钱给刷进去？担心）退房的时候，要张发票，不能开，得到很远的另外一个象招待所一样的，所谓的大酒店去开。不过，公布价跟我实际结算的价（预订价）的原因，总体来说，感觉不是特别的差，比起携程的一些其他的协议酒店来说，不是最差的。补充点评2008年2月17日：本来预订的时候，要求接飞机的，到了北京机场，下了飞机，出了候机楼，根本没有人接飞机。于是自己只能凭以往的习惯去打听，大听到了，那个接飞机的服务员的态度，真TMD的恶劣！不说了。,"Ctrip's hotel reservation is not as good as before.

I haven't seen it before.The safety of the room is poor and there is no internal lock.Because it has just been renovated, although the room equipment is low -grade, it is still new and it feels not too bad.Washing supplies are not as good as the hospitality house.

The so -called big hotel will open.However, the reason for the announcement of the actual settlement of my actual settlement (price), in general, it feels that it is not particularly poor. Compared with some other agreement hotels in Ctrip, it is not the worst.Supplementary comment on February 17, 2008: At the time of reservation, he was required to pick up the plane. When he arrived at Beijing Airport, he got off the plane and was out of the terminal.So I can only inquire with the previous habits.

0,号称三星，顶多招待所的标准，房间前面是个施工工地，晚上也在施工，很吵。还有这个迎宾员感觉有像索要小费的样子，不知道是不是,"Known as Samsung, the standard of the guest house is a construction site in front of the room, and it is also under construction at night, which is very noisy.And this welcome member feels like asking for a tip, I don’t know if it is"

0,看了还算不错的点评，定了标准间，但是无论是硬件还是服务令人失望。硬件设施还不如一般的农家乐，窗户和门并排在走廊一侧，通风很差，一进房门扑鼻而来的就是浓烈的霉味和香烟味，害得我们一晚上就没敢关窗户，卫生间的淋浴设施地面连挡水条也没有，一洗澡就满地是水。前台服务冷冰冰的，我们11点到达，称房间还没打扫完，让我们在大堂等，之后就没人理我们了，过了半小时再去前台问，才给办理手续，实在是太差劲了。,"I read a good review and set the standard room, but it is disappointing whether it is hardware or service.The hardware facilities are not as good as the ordinary farmhouse. The windows and doors are side by side on the side of the corridor. The ventilation is very poor. As soon as the door of the door is tangy is the strong mold and cigarette flavor, which makes us dare not close the windows all night.The floor of the shower facilities does not even have water blocks, and the ground is full of water.The front desk serves cold ice. We arrived at 11 o'clock and said that the room had not been cleaned.Essence"
0,再也不会住这家店了。首先房间隔音差了要命，隔壁的一举一动清清楚楚，半夜居然还关了空调，这么冷的天，都冻感冒了，实在差劲。,"I will never live in this shop anymore.First of all, the room's sound interval was terrible, and the next door was clear. In the middle of the night, the air conditioner was turned off. Such a cold day was frozen and cold, which was really bad."
0,房间设备不是很好，不过走的路线不一样，设备不好是正常的。干净，让人觉得安心才是目标，如家做得不错。只是有一点，房间虽然整理得很干净，但是天气热了，可能要彻底消毒一下，第一天入住的时候在房间看到小强了。火车站出来大概走5分钟就到，交通不错，打车或者到火车站搭车到岳阳楼，君山也挺方便。附近用餐的地方也多，很好。特别一提的是服务员的态度很好，问了几次问题，都很热诚的帮我解答。如果下次还有机会去岳阳玩，估计还是会入住，希望不会再跟小强见面了。,"The room equipment is not very good, but the route is different, and the equipment is not good.Cleaning makes people feel that peace of mind is the goal, and the family is doing well.Just one thing, although the room is well sorted out, the weather is hot, and it may be completely disinfected. When you stay in the room on the first day, you see Xiaoqiang in the room.The train station will take about 5 minutes. The transportation is good. Taxit or take a ride to Yueyang Tower at the train station. Junshan is also very convenient.There are also many places nearby, very good.In particular, the waiter's attitude is very good. After asking a few questions, I helped me answer.If you have the opportunity to go to Yueyang next time, you may still stay in, I hope I won't meet with Xiaoqiang anymore."
0,可能是在黄山上最便宜的一家酒店。当我下午2时拿到房间进去时，看到的是“美国式涂鸦”的墙壁和脏兮兮的被褥、黑乎乎的地板，太吓人了！我直接冲去前台与小姐理论，结果得到的是“网上房间照片和实物有差别，你要去找携程，山上就这条件”。但是在同层空置的房间看去来起码还能住，所以，突然让我感受到携程没优势呀！！后来在我的强烈要求给我换房了，呵呵！,"It may be the cheapest hotel on Huangshan.When I got into the room at 2 pm, I saw the walls of ""American graffiti"" and dirty bedding, and the dark floor, which was so scary!I rushed directly to the front desk and the lady's theory. As a result, I got ""there is a difference from the online room photos and the real objects. You have to find Ctrip. This condition is on the mountain.""But at least in the room in the same layer, I can still live at least, so I suddenly feel that Ctrip has no advantage!IntersectionLater, I changed my room in my strong request, haha!"
0,空调是分体式的，声音实在太响了！并且时不时地发出噼啪声，几乎无法入睡。入住时前台实在太不专业，一边在办理房卡，一边分心做其他事情，只有一位客人办理入住，结果简单的入住手续竟然办了约10分钟之久。入住时双币种信用卡预授权划了美元，向其询问为何不做人民币预授权时，理由时居然说预授权都是用美元的。其实前台没有用银联做人民币预授权，而是用MasterCard做成了美元，实在太不专业了。,"The air conditioner is split, and the sound is too loud!And from time to time, crackling sounds, almost impossible to fall asleep.At the time of check -in, the front desk was too unprofessional. While applying for a room card and doing other things, only one guest handled it to stay. As a result, the simple check -in procedure was about 10 minutes.During the check -in, the two -currency credit card pre -authorized the US dollar and asked them why they were not pre -authorized by RMB. The reason actually said that pre -authorization was used in US dollars.In fact, the front desk does not use UnionPay as a pre -authorization of RMB, but it is made into the US dollar with MasterCard, which is too unprofessional."
0,"一入住,给的IC卡就打不开门,","As soon as I stop, I can't open the door for the IC card,"
0,房间的硬件设施一般，就是淋浴太差，洗澡很不方便。另外，服务也不是太好，房间卫生打扫的不太干净，前台人员业务水平太低，只有一人知道如何刷卡，其他人都不懂，发票中奖金额5元10元的按照规定在发票开具处兑奖，但是这里不论金额多少都不能兑奖，也不解释原因，让人很气愤。总之以后我是不会再去这个酒店了。,"The hardware facilities in the room are average, that is, the shower is too bad, and the bathing is inconvenient.In addition, the service is not too good, the room's sanitary cleaning is not clean, and the level of the front desk personnel is too low. Only one person knows how to swipe the card and the others do not understand., But no matter how much the amount can be redeemed, the reason is not explained, which is very angry.In short, I will not go to this hotel again."
0,1、空调噪音大，换了两个房间都这样；2、有蚊子；3、内部空间较为凌乱。,"1. The air conditioner is noisy, and the two rooms are changed; 2. There are mosquitoes; 3. The internal space is more messy."
0,酒店确实是位于乐山的中心位置，只是饭店的住宿条件太差，感觉已经开业很多年了，但是从该酒店的价位来说的话，算差一点的。,"The hotel is indeed in the center of Leshan, but the hotel accommodation conditions are too bad. It feels like it has been opened for many years, but from the price of the hotel, it is a bit worse."
0,"酒店说是可以免费上网,但只是自带网线而言,如要借用酒店提供的网线,要交使用费10元,好象有点过份了.","The hotel said that it can access the Internet for free, but just with its own network cable, if you want to borrow the network cable provided by the hotel, the payment fee is 10 yuan, it seems a bit too much."
0,1。卫生间小得不得了，没办法洗澡；2。首次入住居然给我一个没有窗户的房间，后经交涉换了一个，为什么不可以第一次就给客人一个好点的印象呢？傻！,"1.The bathroom is too small to take a bath; 2.I gave me a room without a window for the first time, and I changed one of the negotiations. Why not give the guests a better impression for the first time?stupid!"
0,设施非常旧，周边环境也不好，最奇怪是房间内没有暖气，只有挂壁空调，要知道，这种空调室外-5度时候，不会工作的，洛阳可是在淮河以北了。,"The facilities are very old, and the surrounding environment is not good. The most strange thing is that there is no heating in the room, only the wall of the wall. You know, this kind of air conditioner is outdoors-5 degrees, and it will not work. Luoyang is north of the Huaihe River."
0,房间：商务大床房。房间小，洗手间更小。电视21寸，其他设施差。前台：checkin和checkout的速度奇慢。清晨时俩人专为我一人办checkout居然用了15分钟，查房两分钟就答复了啊，然后就慢悠悠地打各种单据，打错了再打，都挺淑女，不急不忙的。结预售权只给了我预售权签名单，我还觉得怎么好像比每次少了张单。临出门叫我回来，原来刷预售权完成时还没让我输密码，真是感觉匪夷所思。只感觉8日那天前台有一个接待员态度很亲切。前台经理态度冷淡，没有见面问好，走说再见。反正我结帐走人时，什么话都没有。人走茶凉的感觉。其实我听不听那一句倒无所谓，不过这总是一个酒店前台最起码该有的素质。洗衣：早八点将待洗衣服交到前台，前台经理给了我一个单据签字，无任何交代，在知道我第二天要退房的前提下，也没告诉我当天不能送回。其他所有酒店都是当天下午六点前送回的，你如家有例外，至少该说一下吧。我回房间重新仔细看了服务指南，只写了收衣服的时间，就是不写送回的时间。最后接受加急，多收了50%的洗衣费，才在晚上快九点时收到洗完的衣服。早餐：服务还好，花样少，包子/炒菜/炝拌菜为主，习惯吃早点的人吃不惯。我每天只吃两块一样的小蛋糕和一杯奶。其他：一天傍晚酒店走廊里有俩人撕打，女的哭得嗓子都破了，后来声音变远一点，可能是从走廊转移到房间。哭喊持续了至少大概十五分钟，貌似没有服务员来查看。第一次住如家，以前住的三星四星五星也都有，按理说如家总应该不比三星差吧。反正是挺失望。看看桌上那博客小书，都写如家怎么怎么亲切，服务员见谁都笑。但这边除餐厅外，没有任何一个服务员见面抬抬眼皮的，更别提问好了。我是感觉我进假如家了。下次宁可离地铁站远100米，我住汉庭去。,"Room: big business bed room.The room is small and the toilet is smaller.Television is 21 inches, and other facilities are poor.Front desk: Checkin and Checkout are slow.In the early morning, the two specially took for me to hold a checkout for 15 minutes, and they answered in two minutes. Then they slowly typed various documents, and they were wrong.The pre -sale right has only given me a list of pre -sale rights. I still feel that it seems that there is a missing order less than each time.I asked me to come back when I came out. I didn't let me pass the password when the pre -sale right was completed. It was really incredible.I just felt that there was a receptionist at the front desk on the 8th.The front desk manager was cold, and asked not to be asked, and said goodbye.Anyway, when I got out of the checkout, there was nothing.People feel the coolness of tea.In fact, it doesn't matter if I can't listen to that sentence, but this is always the at least the quality of the front desk of a hotel.Laundry: At 8 o'clock, I will send the clothes to the front desk at 8 o'clock. The front desk manager gave me a document signature. Without any explanation, I did not tell me that I could not return that day under the premise that I was going to check out the next day.All other hotels were returned before 6 pm that day. If you have an exception, you should say at least.I went back to the room and looked at the service guide carefully. I only wrote the time to collect clothes, but I did not write the return time.Finally, I received an urgency and received 50%of the laundry fee before I received the clothes that was finished at 9 o'clock in the evening.Breakfast: The service is good, there are few patterns, and the buns/stir -fried food/mixing vegetables are the main.I only eat two pieces of small cakes and a glass of milk every day.Others: One night in the hotel corridor, there were two people torn, and the women's crying throat broke. Later, the voice became a little farther, which may be transferred from the corridor to the room.Crying lasted at least 15 minutes, and it seemed that no waiter came to view.For the first time, I lived in a home, and the Samsung four -star and five -star I lived in before. It is reasonable to say that Rujia should always be worse than Samsung.It was disappointed anyway.Looking at the small books on the table, they all wrote how kind of home is kind, and the waiters laughed when they saw anyone.But except for the restaurant, no waiter meets the eyelids, let alone ask questions.I feel like I am home.The next time I would rather be 100 meters away from the subway station, I live in Han Ting."
0,如家应该不错才对，可是没想到很让人失望，一进入方间就被噪音吓了一跳，12楼啊，打开窗户正对越秀的建筑工地，要求换房被告知不行，下雨天，雨伞，吹风机前台说全部俄出去了，没有了。有标visa却被告知不能使用外币卡授权,"If the family should be good, but I didn't expect it to be disappointing. As soon as I entered the square, I was shocked by noise. On the 12th floor, the opening window was facing Yuexiu's construction site.The front desk of the hair dryer said that all Russia went out, no more.There is a standard VISA but was informed that the foreign currency card can be authorized"
0,"7月28号入住的这个酒店，因为图个方便。入住的时候就感到奇怪，有好几个人好像在排队checkin,可前台就一个男服务员在忙乎，而他后面偏偏却站着两个女服务员，什么都不做，光伸着脖子看着男的忙乎。晕倒。轮到我的时候，我告诉那个男的，我要大床房，并且不要靠马路的。谁知被告诉没有不靠马路的房间了，只有一间不靠马路，可是是在二楼，靠近餐厅，可能味道不好。没办法，就住进了8楼靠马路的一间。一进房间，发现房间那么小！！卧室里面空间，除了床之外，没什么空间了。晚上的时候，很吵，因为窗外就是高架，来来往往的车。。。。真后悔。最可恶的是，因为出差很累，就叫了一个中医推拿，点名要正规的。刚开始的时候还比较正规，后来就老是在耳边墨迹有什么什么特殊的。我听的很烦，叫她不要再说，没想到她匆匆了事就要走。给她的钱应该再找我20块左右，居然告诉我说别找了，麻烦。晕倒。真是垃圾","This hotel staying on July 28 is convenient because the picture is convenient.When I stayed, I felt weird.

0,在携程查到这家酒店有健身房，并且价位也还合适，于是选择了这家酒店的。我是7月28日入住酒店的，到了酒店看到大堂还可以，到了房间也较大，到目前心情还不错，可是悲惨的事情开始了。我看酒店的服务指南上没有写有健身房，就打电话问总机健身房在几楼，总机说我们酒店没有健身房。这家酒店不是欺骗消费者吗！我打电话到携程投诉，携程说去联系一下。等一会儿，出现了一个前厅经理到我房间道歉，说酒店的健身房在装修，并送了一个果盘。我到现在还很纳闷，这家酒店到底有没有健身房？他们为什么不能诚信一些？接着倒霉事有开始了，我发现房间里面有很多小虫子，我看了看窗户，是封死的。我发现果盘上落了一层小虫子。我不知道是这酒店的卫生情况就这么差，厨房会有那么多虫子，还是前厅经理故意恶心我？想不明白就不想了。又打电话到前台投诉，被通知可以从11楼换到16楼的一个房间。有收拾了行李，到16楼的房间。这时到了6点多，只好去吃饭。出了酒店，发现和网上介绍的又不一样，周围环境乱极了，旁边还有一片空地，上面有一些建筑垃圾，风一刮到处都是土。终于找到一家快餐店，吃了，就回酒店。回了房间，开始工作写报告。第三件悲惨的事情来了，到了九点多停电了。问前台怎么回事，什么时候来电？前台就说在和供电局联系，也不知道什么时候来电。就这样在黑暗中望着天花板过了将近2个小时，才来电。来了电赶快去洗澡，水龙头的水要不很热要不很凉，我想是不是停电的原因，明天再洗吧。到了第二天早上，水龙头依然如故，实在无语。赶快退房走人吧。另：早上从酒店出来打车，北园路很堵。还有这家酒店是住过的许多酒店中，唯一一家没有免费矿泉水的酒店。用一句广告语：谁住谁后悔。,"In Ctrip found that the hotel has a gym and the price is also suitable, so I chose this hotel.I stayed at the hotel on July 28. I was okay to see the lobby at the hotel. It was also large in the room. At present, my mood is not bad, but the tragic things have begun.I saw that the hotel's service guide did not write a gym, so I called and asked the company's gym on several floors. The company said that our hotel has no gym.Isn't this hotel deceiving consumers!I called Ctrip complaints, and Ctrip said to contact.After a while, a front hall manager appeared to apologize to my room, saying that the gym of the hotel was renovating and sent a fruit plate.I am still wondering, is there any gym in this hotel?Why can't they be honest?Then the unlucky things started. I found that there were many small bugs in the room. I looked at the window and was sealed.I found a small layer of bugs on the fruit plate.I don't know if the hygiene of this hotel is so bad. There will be so many bugs in the kitchen, or the manager of the front hall deliberately disgusting me?If you don't understand, don't think about it.I called the front desk to complain, and was notified from the 11th floor to a room on the 16th floor.I packed my luggage and went to the room on the 16th floor.At 6 o'clock, I had to go to dinner.When I got out of the hotel, I found that it was not the same as the online introduction. The surrounding environment was extremely messy. There was a empty space next to it. There were some construction waste on it. The wind was scratched everywhere.Finally found a fast food restaurant, and after eating, I went back to the hotel.After returning to the room and starting the work report.The third tragic thing came, and the power was stopped at 9 o'clock.Ask what is going on at the front desk and when to call?The front desk said to contact the power supply bureau, and I don't know when to call.In this way, I looked at the ceiling for nearly 2 hours in the dark before calling.When you come, go to the bath. The water of the faucet is not very hot or cold. I think it ’s the reason for the power outage. Wash it tomorrow.The next morning, the faucet was still as speechless.Hurry up and leave the room.Another: Come out of the hotel in the morning, Beiyuan Road is very blocking.And this hotel is the only hotel in many hotels where there is no free mineral water.A slogan: Who regrets who live."
0,酒店个映效果太差！而且窗户打开之后居然是楼道内的广告牌，地板有高低甚至我没穿鞋子起来上厕所脚被硬生生的磕了一下。~这是我在携程上定到现在环境最差的一家酒店了！！！补充点评2008年6月15日：说错了！是隔音效果太差太差了！！！,"The hotel's screening effect is too bad!And after the window is opened, it is actually the billboard in the corridor.

0,对这家店非常之失望，希望想去的驴友慎重考虑。1。离四方街比较远，要15－20分钟的路程，晚上如果超过10点钟回客栈，路上就没有路灯了，而且周围静得有点可怕，感觉不太安全。2。我们连住了两个晚上，第一天感觉收拾得还算干净，可是第二天回来就发现房间根本没打扫，只是随便铺了一下床，连一次性牙具也没换，只是随便塞了支小牙膏进去，装牙刷的袋子根本没有密封的。3。我用房间的毛巾擦了下桌子（因为桌子没清洁，所以我要自己动手），还弄了点泥巴，最后店家坚持这是洗澡的毛巾，有泥巴肯定是洗不掉的，要我们赔了20元。4。接我们去机场的司机看到事发全过程，后来建议我们回来投诉，并且说他们一直觉得这家店的服务跟态度不好。5。其实在丽江，好的客栈多得是，服务也很好，同行的朋友用80元就租到很好的客栈，这家店150元的价格相对来讲还是高了点。以上5点是我对这家店最最中恳的评价，也没有中伤店家的意思，只是实事求事地说出了我的经历，也是用我不愉快的经历对各位驴友提个醒，希望以后携程能慎重推荐酒店。,"I am very disappointed with this shop, and I hope to go to the donkey friends carefully.1.It is far from Sifang Street. It takes 15-20 minutes. If you return to the Inn more than 10 o'clock in the evening, there will be no street lights on the road, and the surroundings are a bit terrible and it feels not safe.2.We lived for two nights. On the first day, we felt that cleaning was clean, but when we came back the next day, we found that the room did not clean up at all, but just paved the bed casually, and even the one -time dental tool was not changed.Small toothpaste goes in, and the bag with a toothbrush is not sealed at all.3.I wiped the table with a towel in the room (because the table was not cleaned, so I had to do it myself), and I also made a little mud. Finally, the store insisted that this was a bathing towel.20 yuan.4.The driver who took us to the airport saw the entire process of the incident. Later, we suggested that we come back to complain, and said that they always felt that the service and attitude of this store had a bad attitude.5.In fact, in Lijiang, there are many good inn and the service is very good. Friends who use each other rented a good inn 80 yuan. The price of 150 yuan in this store is relatively high.The above 5 points are my most sincere evaluation of this shop, and I do n’t mean to hurt the store. I just said my experience in practical care.Ctrip can carefully recommend hotels."
0,宾馆没有晚餐，附近也没有什么餐馆。网速时快时慢，常掉线。我去时正维修，没凉水，热水没法洗澡。房外车太吵，让人睡不着。宾馆里没东西卖，什么都没有。很差。宾馆反馈2008年6月18日：由于酒店开业前期给您入住造成不便表示歉意！现在酒店二楼餐厅已经正常提供中晚餐。冷热水管道已经改造完毕，已经正常稳定。前台商品柜已经配备各类小商品，正常供货。欢迎您的再次入住，提出宝贵意见。,"There are no dinner in the hotel, and there are no restaurants nearby.The Internet speed is fast and slow, and often falls.When I went, I was repairing, without cold water, and I couldn't take a bath.The outside of the house is too noisy to sleep.There is nothing to sell in the hotel and nothing.Very bad.Hotel feedback on June 18, 2008: apologetic due to inconvenience caused by inconvenience caused by the hotel in the opening of the hotel!The restaurant on the second floor of the hotel now has normally provided mid -dinner.The hot and cold water pipeline has been transformed and it has been normal and stable.The front desk business cabinets are already equipped with various small products, which are supplied normally.Welcome to stay again and make valuable comments."

0,第一个吃螃蟹的人，基本上是要作出牺牲的。这个酒店，除了位置在长江边，一线江景外，其他真是一文不值。房间比较小，空调也不够强劲，被子又薄，结果是活活冻了一夜。洗手间与洗澡间的地面没有隔断，洗澡后满地的水。晚上有小姐骚扰电话。早餐非常差，居然还收10元。楼下环境比较乱，好像是批发市场。附近有江滨公园，没有什么可以玩的；马路对面有汽车站和码头，不清楚去哪里的。出酒店右转再右转有足浴城，去了一次，还不错。携程的信息非常不准确，本人住这个酒店，是携程的信息，该酒店离机场15公里，根本是胡说八道，市区不论从哪里打车过去，都是收80-100。,"The first person to eat crabs is basically sacrificed.This hotel, except for the side of the Yangtze River and the front line of the river, is really worthless.The room was relatively small, the air conditioner was not strong enough, and the quilt was thin. As a result, it was frozen all night.There is no partition from the ground from the bathroom and the ground, and the water is full of water after bathing.In the evening, there was a lady harassing call.Breakfast is very bad, and it still receives 10 yuan.The environment downstairs is relatively chaotic, as if it is the wholesale market.There are Jiangbin Parks nearby, there is nothing to play; there are bus stations and docks across the road.Turn right away from the hotel and turn right and have a foot bath. I went once, and it was not bad.The information of Ctrip is very inaccurate. I live in this hotel and is Ctrip's information. The hotel is 15 kilometers away from the airport. It is simply nonsense. No matter where the urban area takes a taxi, it will collect 80-100."
0,隔音太差，走廊有人说话就像在自己房间说话一样。房间门关闭不顺畅，要用力推。服务员爱理不理的，前台服务员连英语也不会说。卫生一般。,"The sound insulation is too bad, and some people in the corridor are like talking in their own room.The door of the room is not smooth, and it must be pushed hard.The waiter ignored it, and the front desk waiter would not even speak English.Sanitary average."

0,1、靠马路一边很吵，即使关了窗。2、服务态度极差。我有一个东西可能拉在了酒店，晚上打电话问他们，说服务员下班了，要我第二天再问，然后我留了手机，他们说第二天上午打电话给我。结果第二天到中午也没有人打电话给我，我又去问，然后前台说昨天晚上没有留下我的信息，再让客房部去查，十分钟后给我电话。结果又没有给我电话。过了二十分钟我只好又去问，说正在查，过五分钟打给我，又没打。最后我过了几个小时再打给他们，然后听见他们急匆匆的通知服务员去查。不知道这样的酒店怎么能号称中国中档酒店领先品牌？我不会再住这个酒店。,"1. It is noisy on the side of the road, even if the window is closed.2. The service attitude is very poor.I have something to pull in the hotel. At night, I called them and the persuasive officer was off work. I asked me to ask again the next day. Then I left my phone. They said that they called me the next morning.As a result, no one called me the next day to noon. I went to ask again, and then the front desk said that I did not leave my information last night, and then asked the guest room department to check it. After ten minutes, I called me.As a result, I didn't call me.After twenty minutes, I had to ask again, saying that they were checked, and I called me in five minutes without playing.In the end, I will call them after a few hours, and then I hear them in a hurry to notify the waiter to check.I do n’t know how such a hotel can claim to be the leading brand in China?I won't stay in this hotel anymore."
0,选汉庭是因为酒店本身介绍、大约知道的汉庭创始者渊源、之前旅客的评价等。但结果非常令人失望。在说令人失望的情况前先说一下还算好的方面，以保持客观和平衡。大堂接待还是礼貌和规范的，办理手续确实比较快捷；房间本身还是整洁完备；房间里上网有不间断电源插孔，虽无暇判定是否确实；房间有几本流行书籍，无电脑也许可消磨时间。下面是令人失望部分：一、房价有严重的甲醛味道，其味道严重程度使我不认为这是健康可住的正常状态。味道最严重的是洗手间。虽关闭洗手间也无法断绝味道外溢。酒店虽解释说是因为新装修开业，但如此状态根本不具备对外开业的条件。其实际让顾客判断是否可住的态度是对顾客的不尊重。二、临街房间噪音很大。订房时特地文字说明要安静的房间，结果不但临街而且临最嘈杂的十字路口，房间窗口外就是医院大字招牌，噪音环境极差。对顾客要求置若罔闻更是又一不尊重顾客表现。另一个朝向的房间不临街，但临拆迁房片区，噪音是否大也不好判断。三、洗手间非常小，开门几乎进不了淋浴房。排气扇功率严重不够。甲醛味道重使此问题进一步凸显。原本以为汉庭高层和携程渊源，各方面总不会太差，结果，重庆汉庭令人非常失望。硬件本身的问题是一方面，对顾客健康、要求的基本尊重都没有就是本身素质问题。本人去重庆肯定再也不会去汉庭。,"Select Hanting because of the hotel itself, the origin of the founder of Han Ting, and the evaluation of the previous passengers.But the result is very disappointing.Before talking about disappointment, let's talk about good aspects to maintain objectiveness and balance.The lobby reception is still polite and standardized, and the procedures are indeed relatively fast; the room itself is still neat and complete; there is a non -stop power jack on the Internet in the room. Although there is no time to determine whether there are certain popular books in the room, there may be timeless time.Below is disappointing part: First, house prices have a serious formaldehyde flavor, and the severity of its taste makes me not think this is a normal state of healthy and lively.The worst taste is the toilet.Although it was closed to the toilet, it was impossible to break the taste.Although the hotel explains that it is because the new renovation is opened, it does not have the conditions for opening the industry at all.Actually let customers judge whether they can live in disrespect to customers.Second, there is a lot of noise in the street room.During the reservation, the room specifically explained the room that should be quiet. As a result, not only the streets and the most noisy crossroads were at the street. The room window was the hospital's large character signboard, and the noise environment was extremely poor.Driven from customers is another disrespect for customer performance.The other room is not facing the street, but whether the noise is large in the demolition area of the house.Third, the bathroom is very small, and the door can hardly enter the shower room.The power of exhaust fans is not enough.The taste of formaldehyde has further prominent this problem.Originally thought that Hanting's senior management and Ctrip originated were not too bad in all aspects. As a result, Chongqing Hanting was very disappointed.The problem of hardware itself is on the one hand. There is no basic respect for customers' health and basic respect.I will definitely never go to Hanting again when I go to Chongqing."

0,"感觉硬件太差,下次不会去,价格还不低,服务态度一般.",It feels that the hardware is too bad. I won't go next time. The price is not low. The service attitude is average.
0,房间设施很差，给我的电子门卡居然不能打开房门，换了一个电子门卡还是不行。最后只能给我一把钥匙。房间里的毛巾洗得黑糊糊的样子，很硬。前台服务倒还周到，还给免费升级为大床房了。不过大床房的空间很小，隔音也不好。性价比不是很高。,"The room facilities were very poor. I couldn't open the door to my electronic door card. It was still impossible to change an electronic door card.In the end, I can only give me a key.The towel in the room was washed black, very hard.The front desk service is thoughtful, and it is also upgraded to a large bed.However, the space of the big bed room is small, and the sound insulation is not good.The cost performance is not very high."
0,大床房的面积实在太小了！除了床和写字台就没有空间了，没有衣柜，床头柜也只有一个！和如家一样，但价格要贵100元，实在不值得！以后不会再住了！,"The area of the big bed room is too small!There is no room except the bed and writing table. There is no wardrobe, and there is only one bedside table!Like home, but the price is 100 yuan, it is not worth it!I won't live anymore in the future!"
0,我终于领教了人家说莫泰是上海典型的一夜情宾馆了。入住后感觉确实整个硬件设施比锦江之星的要上个档次，空间也大。可是服务太烂：1、我住的房间竟然墙体受潮，表面涂层开裂，就没人管了。2、喝水的杯子在第二天打扫的时候，根本没人清洗，要自己动手。3、房间里有很重的霉味，开窗都没用。4、前台的服务技能和态度都贼差。要么就是啥都不懂的实习生，问你些让你胸闷的问题，要么就是很凶的男人，死活不给你刷卡单的底联。我都纳闷用了群什么人在这里做活，是不是工资太低只能找到这些被社会抛弃的人？唯独值得提的是，美林阁的饮食还好。可惜服务一样差，坐在那里没人管。,"I finally taught others that Motai is a typical one -night stand of Shanghai.After check -in, it feels that the entire hardware facility is more than the Jinjiang Star, and the space is greater.But the service was too bad: 1. The wall I lived turned out to be moisture, and the surface coating was cracked, so no one cares.2. When the water drinking the water was cleaned the next day, no one was cleaned at all, and he had to do it by himself.3. There is a heavy moldy smell in the room, and it is useless to open the window.4. The service skills and attitudes of the front desk are poor.Either an intern who doesn't understand anything, ask you some questions that make you chest tightness, or are a very fierce man.I wondered who used the group to work here. Is it too low salary and can I find those who have been abandoned by the society?It is worth mentioning that Meilin Pavilion's diet is okay.Unfortunately, the service is as poor, and no one is sitting there."
0,这个酒店的设施虽然简单，但服务态度恶劣，一点都不尊重客人！我是5月21日通过携程网预定的房间，办理入住时我用信用卡交付押金，头几次收银人员告诉我密码错误，然后我就重新输入。最后他告诉我密码成功，也不知道为什么预授权了600.08元。但是，刚转身收到银行的短信，说我的帐户被冻结了两笔，分别是600元、600.08元。我让前台给我解释一下，结果那三个值班人员，把我支来支去，特别是那天19：00左右值班的收银人员，一个胖胖男子，戴眼镜，态度极其恶劣，不进行任何解释，我在向他反映情况时，他只顾和其他员工讲话，一点不尊重客人！后来经交涉，一个中年女子出面说，可以先给我退房，说留下电话第二天电话复我，让财务人员给我解释。可是，直到5月25日，一个回复的电话都没有！我打电话过去，又是推脱！知道现在还没解决。我会继续等他给我解释，一旦导致我帐户钱损失，我将采取法律措施。补充点评2008年5月25日：大家看看一下的这些留言和点评，可见这家酒店的服务态度差是公认的，并且不少和信用卡支付有关！！！,"Although the facilities of this hotel are simple, the service attitude is bad, and they do not respect the guests at all!I passed the room scheduled by Ctrip.com on May 21st. When I handled it, I delivered the deposit with a credit card. The first few cashiers told me that the password was wrong, and then I re -entered it.In the end, he told me that the password was successful, and he didn't know why he had authorized 600.08 yuan.However, I just turned around and received a text message from the bank, saying that my account was frozen two, which were 600 yuan and 600.08 yuan.I asked the front desk to explain it to me. As a result, the three duty staff members supported me, especially the cashier who were on duty at around 19:00 that day, a fat man, wearing glasses, very bad attitude, no explanation without any explanation, no explanation did not explain any explanation.When I report to him, he only talked to other employees and did not respect the guests at all!Later, after negotiation, a middle -aged woman said that she could check me out first, and said that the next day the phone called me to return to me the next day, so that the financial staff explained to me.However, until May 25, there was no phone call!I called in the past and pushed off again!Knowing that it has not been resolved yet.I will continue to wait for him to explain to me. Once I lose my account money, I will take legal measures.Supplementary comment on May 25, 2008: Let's take a look at these messages and comments. It can be seen that the service attitude of this hotel is recognized and many are related to credit card payment!IntersectionIntersection"
0,就因为地段比较好一点，但是这个家庭式的宾馆，只能说服务也好，设施也好，都只能算很普通很普通的那种家庭式的旅店而已。比较老式的房子，服务员对打扫房间很不仔细，一般就只是倒了倒垃圾，床铺的话，就把被子放放好，连枕头都没放好。厕所里的话，就把垃圾拿出去，我看连地都没拖一下，洗脸盆都没给清理一下呢。房间里很闷，任何通风的设备都没有。宾馆反馈2008年6月3日：感谢上位客人的评价，您的意见就是对于我们工作的推进，经济型快捷式的酒店也许我们还是会有不到位的地方，经过多次培训后在客房服上己经严格执行“一客一换，全部更新”，并在会在此同时增加消费品等。希望以后为不同客人带来增值服务的享受。,"Because the location is better, but this family -style hotel can only be said to be service or facilities, it can only be regarded as ordinary and ordinary family -style hotels.For the old -fashioned house, the waiter is not careful about the cleaning room. Generally, it is just pouring garbage. If the bed, put the quilt and not even put the pillow.In the toilet, I took out the garbage. I didn't even drag the ground, and I didn't clean the washbasin.The room is very stuffy, and there is no ventilation equipment.Hotel feedback on June 3, 2008: Thanks for the evaluation of superior guests. Your opinion is the advancement of our work. The fast -moving hotel may still be in place. After many training, we will be in place.After strictly implementing ""one guest and one change, all updates"", and will increase consumer goods at the same time.I hope to bring value -added services to different guests in the future."

0,酒店比较旧，靠近机场，能听到很大的噪音。而且早餐非常差，简直就是没东西吃。我再也不会住在这个酒店的。宾馆反馈2008年3月14日：尊敬的客人您好，非常感谢您的宝贵意见，对于您入住期间遇到的不愉快经历，我们深表歉意，以下是我们关于您的意见的反馈情况：1.关于您提到的噪音和酒店陈旧问题，由于酒店地处厦门主要干线-湖里大道西段，距离机场10分钟车程，这是酒店交通便利的主要优势。但随之而来的就是噪音问题。厦门联发集团于2007年5月份投入巨资对酒店重新进行装修，在隔音方面做了最大的改进和提高。酒店装修完工投入使用以来，未收到客人关于噪音的投诉。2.早餐：针对前几年团队为主的早餐，酒店在人员配备和早餐种类及数量都做了很大的改进，目前早餐包括了小菜、饮料、热菜、糕点、主食、沙拉等40多种菜品，能够满足各种客人的不同喜好。我们非常珍惜每一位客人的投诉，非常珍惜每次能为客人提供服务的机会。也许酒店方面现在还不能做到十全十美，但是我们一直在努力，希望您能再次光临丽轩酒店，感受到我们的改变。最后再次感谢您的意见和建议，因为正是有了您这样的客人，才使丽轩一直进步、不断完善。谢谢！,"The hotel is older, near the airport, you can hear a lot of noise.And breakfast is very bad, just nothing to eat.I will never live in this hotel again.Hotel feedback on March 14, 2008: Dear guests, thank you very much for your valuable opinions. For the unpleasant experience you encountered during your stay, we apologize, the following is our feedback on your opinion: 1.Regarding the noise and old problems you mentioned, because the hotel is located in the western section of the main line of Xiamen-Huli Avenue, it is a 10-minute drive from the airport. This is the main advantage of hotel traffic convenience.But what follows is noise.In May 2007, Xiamen MediaTeng Group invested heavily in re -decoration of the hotel and made the biggest improvement and improvement in sound insulation.Since the hotel renovation is completed and put into use, the guests have not received the guest's complaint on noise.2. Breakfast: In response to the team -based breakfast in previous years, the hotel has made great improvements in personnel equipment and the types and quantitiesPlanting dishes can satisfy the different preferences of various guests.We cherish the complaints of each guest, and we cherish the opportunity to provide services for guests at each time.Maybe the hotel is not yet perfect, but we have been working hard, I hope you can visit Lixuan Hotel again and feel our changes.Finally, thank you again for your opinions and suggestions, because it is, because there are guests like you that Li Xuan has been progressing and continuously.Thanks!"
0,从徐州出完差假道回厦门，原来想好好放松一下，因为是晚上九点钟才到，所以预定了高级房，无所谓前台服务怎样，拿到房间卡片开门一看，跟携程图片完全两样，典型九十年代中的装修，没所谓，我只住一晚，将就了。毕竟提前放置在房间的水果，还告诉我是携程的客人，但随后而来的服务员改变了我的想法，她直白的告诉我，总服务台叫她将水果撤掉，问原因，送错而已，但是携程网站上是有送水果饮料的，我很尴尬，我打电话询问携程，客户专员会协调，最终反馈到我这里时，只是简单的前台不知道我是携程的客人，不知道我是携程的客人，他如何知道预定的房间是高级间，如何知道我几点到达？我不清楚是不是我们的衣着打扮不得体，还是我们是小地方来的引来这种问题，还是真正由于工作人员疏忽引起的。可惜了，原来我本想去1912的，没了心情早早睡下了。（稍后我拒绝了大堂经理，升级房间，延迟退房等道歉方式，来稍稍抗议了下我的不满）我想下次去南京，我会慎重考虑下我的选择。,"After returning to Xiamen from the fake road from Xuzhou, I wanted to relax well, because it was only nine o'clock in the evening, so I booked a high -end house. It didn't matter what the front desk service was.Typical decoration in the 1990s did not mean, I only lived for one night, and I would.After all, the fruits placed in the room in advance, and told me that it was Ctrip's guests, but the waiter who came later changed my thoughts. She told me straightforwardly that the general service desk asked herJust, but there are fruit drinks on the Ctrip website. I am very embarrassed. I called Ctrip. The client commissioner would coordinate. When I was fed back to me, I was just a simple front desk. I do n’t know that I am the guests of Ctrip.It is Ctrip's guest. How do he know that the booking room is a high -level room. How do I know how much I arrived?I do n’t know if our clothes are unable to dress, or whether we have caused this kind of problem in a small place, or it is really caused by the negligence of the staff.Unfortunately, I wanted to go to 1912, but I had no mood to go to bed early.(Later, I rejected the lobby manager, upgraded the room, delayed check -out and other apologies, etc., to protest my dissatisfaction a little) I want to go to Nanjing next time, and I will consider my choice carefully."
0,早餐有还不如无！这傍边就是长途汽车站，可想而知这外面的环境是个什么样子！住在这里的人更多的是中转旅客的样子，我见过尼姑，和尚！房间设施也就比招待所好点的样子，比较旧的酒店，名字虽然很时尚，但是酒店真的没有可比性。有个米兰俱乐部，估计是happy的地方，还有个桑拿按摩的地方，这个不用我多说大家也晓得是干吗的，每天晚上10点准时房间电话响起，招不招就随你了。大家自己掂量着吧。,"Breakfast is not as good as nothing!This is the long -distance bus station, you can imagine what the outside environment is like!People who live here are more like a transit passenger. I have seen a nun, a monk!The room facilities are better than the hospitality. Although the old hotel is relatively fashionable, the hotel is really comparable.There is a Milan Club, which is estimated to be a place to have, and there is a place where sauna massage. This does not need to say what everyone knows. Every night, the room phone sounds on time at 10 pm.Let's weigh them by themselves."

0,那是什么破酒店，你们携程也对外推荐啊，那里面那个破。服务极差，我入驻708，房间门是用纸胡的，洗脸盆下水坏了了。问服务员，酒店是10年前装修的，而携程介绍是2006年装修的。早餐质量极差，服务员的服务态度也很差，想要个汤勺都没有。吃到后面连盘子都没有。其实我感觉最差的是携程的服务，向一个钻石贵宾推荐了一个未经核实的虚假信息，然后启客户不顾，让客户自行在一个陌生的城市去寻找住处，到2008年1月1日仍没有对投诉进行反馈，不过我可以理解，因为携程处理该事务的人员放假了。至于客户有什么样的意见，哈哈，开假后再说。再见了携程。宾馆反馈2008年1月2日：感谢您对我酒店提出宝贵意见，对于您在我们酒店入住期间所经历的不满意，我们深表歉意，我们酒店是98年开始营业的，经营至今曾分期逐层进行装修过，而且以供客人多种房型选择而著称，像适合商务客人的特色标准间（以大床居多，06年新装），适合夫妻带孩子出行的家庭房，还有普通的大床等。关于餐饮方面，确属我们管理疏忽，不过时至春节，招工甚难，还望能多加理解，不过这不是理由，我们一定要加强培训，提高员工顾客意识，做为对你的致歉，我们将减免您的当日房费，并附赠您一份礼物以表歉意，期盼您再次光临指导！,"What is the break in the hotel? You also recommend it to the outside world, the broken in it.The service was very poor. I settled in 708. The room door was used in paper.Ask the waiter, the hotel was renovated 10 years ago, and Ctrip Introduction was decorated in 2006.The quality of breakfast is very poor, and the service attitude of the waiter is also very poor. There is no spoon.There is no plate after eating.In fact, the worst thing I feel is Ctrip's service. I recommend a false information to a diamond VIP, and then open the customer to let the customers look for a place of living in a strange city. By January 1, 2008,There is no feedback on the complaint, but I can understand, because Ctrip's handling of the affairs is on vacation.As for what kind of opinions have the opinions, haha, let's talk about it after the holiday.Goodbye to Ctrip.Hotel feedback on January 2, 2008: Thank you for making valuable opinions on our hotel. We are deeply apologized for your unsatisfactory time for your hotel.The layers have been decorated, and they are known for guests with multiple room types. Like characteristic standard rooms suitable for business guests (mostly in large beds, new installations in 2006), family houses suitable for couples with children, as well as ordinary large bedswait.Regarding catering, it is indeed negligent in management, but it is difficult to recruit workers from time to time to the Spring Festival, but I hope to understand more, but this is not a reason. We must strengthen training and improve employees' awareness.Reduce your house fee and come with you a gift to apologize, and I look forward to your guidance again!"
0,轻轨虹口足球场站下来是西江湾路400多号，店在700多号，不近也不远。在预订时间内到达，前台告知订的商务房要再等3小时左右才有空房，建议换成同价位的标准房，于是入住标准房。房间设施马马虎虎：台灯有两个，一个写字台一个床头柜，不错；电视剧有点小，而且经常信号不清，画面模糊；窗正对轻轨，因此有点吵；窗边的墙面已经烂了发霉。另外，夜里十二点多洗澡时热水不足，不过早上恢复正常。进楼道也需要刷房卡，安全措施好,"The light rail Hongkou Football Stadium stood down 400 Xijiangwan Road, and the store was on the number of more than 700, not near and not far.When you arrive within the booking time, the commercial house that the front desk is notified will have to wait about 3 hours before there is an empty house. It is recommended to replace the standard house at the same price, so stay in the standard room.The room facilities are sloppy: there are two table lamps, one in office and one bedside table, which is good; the TV series is a bit small, and the signal is unclear, the picture is blurred; the window is facing the light rail, so it is a bit noisy;In addition, the hot water was insufficient at 12 o'clock at night, but it returned to normal in the morning.You also need to swipe the room card in the corridor.

0,酒店是挂星四星，但也就二星水平，早餐花样太少。如果是四星就按四星去做，如果说房价低就不要挂四星，以后考虑换其它酒店。另外宽带还得收20块。,"The hotel is four stars, but the two -star level is too small.If it is four -star, do not hang four stars if the house price is low. Consider changing other hotels in the future.In addition, the broadband has to receive 20 yuan."
0,四个字，“糟糕透顶”。我是晚上十一点过入住的。首先是交通的不便利，到酒店必须走三峡大坝的专用高速路，同时还要到路过的几个武警“拦截站”停车检查专用的通行证。即使出示了酒店的证件也要被当兵的盘问很久，由于带着孩子心里很不爽。酒店安排专门为我们送通行证的接待人员还要我们开车到家里去接，办完手续后还要求送其回家。折腾半天下来已经快凌晨一点才到酒店。总台值班服务员的态度更加糟糕，没有笑脸就不说了，对,"Four words, ""terrible top"".I stayed at 11 o'clock in the evening.The first is the inconvenience of transportation. When you go to the hotel, you must take the special highway of the Three Gorges Dam. At the same time, you have to go to several armed police ""intercepting stations"" to park the parking inspection.Even if the hotel's documents were shown, they would be questioned for a long time, because they were uncomfortable to take the child.The hotel arranges the reception staff who send us a pass to us to drive at home. After finishing the formalities, we also want to send them home.It was almost 1 o'clock in the morning until I tossed for a long time.The attitude of the waiter on duty is even worse."

Yichang's four -star must not be compared with the four -star of the big city.Specifically, let's talk about the situation: 1. The room is said to be relatively old. The facilities seem to be older, and the degree of cleaning is yet to be inspected. 2. It is said that Soso3.

0,"以后再也不去住这个酒店了，从来没住过这么差的酒店，还是挂五星的！！！！！维景以前是希尔顿酒店，后来才改名的，最早刚开幕时去住过几次，感觉还可以，但后来去南京就一直住金鹰了（房价和维景也差不多，毕竟都是五星级的），因为金鹰在新街口，逛街吃东西都方便，但由于现在南京的中山东路在修地铁外地车不能进，去金鹰的话要绕道珠江路一圈才能到，这次就懒得开车进市区，订了维景，一下沪宁高速就可以把车停着了，经过这次的经验，以后还是宁可多开点车去金鹰了。1.预定的时候要求“务必安排大床房“，携程也回复短信确认了，但到了前台一问是双床房，也问了前台说预定的时候不是说明“务必”要安排大床房的吗？！前台回复：”我们确认的时候没有这样确认的，而且现在大床房也没有了“，算了，办正事要紧，就入住吧，也懒得去和她理论和打电话去携程问是怎么一回事了。2.晚上我朋友打电话去找我，总机说房间客人姓名不对不能转，我朋友以为我说错房号了，打电话来问我，我说房号没错，他又打了一次还是说客人姓名不对不能转，连打了四五次，总机才把电话转过来！！！！！！3.入住期间喝了一瓶可乐和一瓶雪碧，结转时34.50，这是黑店啊，不过这没办法，人家是明码标价写在纸上的，只能怪自己不长眼了！！！4.什么都搞定了，去开车回家了，到了停车场（是露天的，就在酒店门口三四十米处吧），20块钱！！！问收费员说停车卷上面的免费停车处不是请前台盖章了吗还要收钱吗？！原来是过夜的话还要交20块钱的（停车卷背面那一整面密密麻麻的写了，是收费员跟我说的，我也懒得去看了），真TMD的奇怪，住酒店不过夜还住个屁啊？！五星级的酒店宽带要收费是稀松平常，但住宿停车要给钱的倒还是第一次碰见的！！！！总之以后是不会再去住维景了，金鹰，金陵，喜来登，甚至四星的中心大酒店不管是硬件或服务我觉得都比维景好。补充点评2008年1月24日：唯一让我满意的就是门口的门童，我出门吃饭的时候，他很亲切的帮我叫车，还跟我解释说由于现在是下班时间又是出租车交接班，麻烦我稍等一下！！！宾馆反馈2008年4月14日：非常感谢客户对我酒店的反馈.针对酒店停车收费事宜,我们将给予携程客户特别优惠,凡通过携预订并入住酒店的客户,凭酒店停车卡,在前台盖取免费停车章,可直接享受免费停车服务.谢谢!","I will never stay in this hotel anymore in the future. I have never lived in such a bad hotel, or hang five stars!IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIt was the Hilton Hotel before Wei Jing. Later, it was renamed. I went to live a few times when I first opened it. It feels okay, but then I always lived in the Golden Eagle when I went to Nanjing.), Because the Golden Eagle is convenient to eat on the Xinjiekou, it is convenient to go shopping, but because the cars of the Zhongshan East Road in Nanjing are not available outside the repair of the subway, you must go around the Golden Eagle to go around Zhujiang Road. This time you are too lazy to drive into the city.In the district, I booked a dimension, and the car can stop the car at the highway of the Shanghai -Nanjing highway. After this experience, I would rather drive more cars to the Golden Eagle in the future.1. When booked, ""Be sure to arrange a large bed room"". Ctrip also replied to the SMS confirmation, but when I asked the front desk as a double bed room, I also asked the front desk that it was not explained that ""must"" arrange the big bed room when the booking is not allowed to arrange the big bed room.?IntersectionThe front desk replied: ""We did not confirm this when we confirmed, and now the big bed room is gone."" Forget it, let's stay in the case, so I'm too lazy to go to the theory and call to Ctrip.It's the matter.2. In the evening, my friend called to find me. The chief aircraft said that the guest name of the room was wrong. My friend thought I said the wrong house number, and called me to ask me.

0,强烈建议携程取消这个酒店的合作！14日为招待客人预订四间客房，客人入住过后即发现房间内均有强烈的刺激性气味，怀疑是装修造成的，4位客人在房间内呆了2小时左右，即感觉呼吸困难，眼睛红肿，无奈要求店方换房，前台服务员态度十分傲慢，坚称从未有客人投诉房间气味问题，并称房间均已住满，不可能调房，要求退房也可以但是房费不能退。后来客人要求退房并请有关部门进行空气质量监测，这时前台经理才出现，给调整了房间。本次经历严重影响单位形象，而且深感奥运在即，对国宏的服务水平表示担忧。,"It is strongly recommended to cancel the cooperation of this hotel!On the 14th, I reservations for four rooms to entertain the guests. After the guests checked in, they found that there was a strong irritating smell in the room. It was suspected that it was caused by the decoration. Four guests stayed in the room for about 2 hours, that is, they felt difficult to breathe, their eyes were red and swollen., Helplessly asked the store to change the house. The front desk waiter was very arrogant. He insisted that there were never customers complaining about the smell of the room. They also said that the rooms were full. It was impossible to adjust the house.Later, the guest asked to check out and asked the relevant departments to monitor air quality. At this time, the front desk manager appeared and adjusted the room.This experience seriously affects the image of the unit, and I feel that the Olympic Games is imminent, expressing concerns about Guohong's service level."

0,我订了豪华房，不知为什么是副楼最里边最靠犄角的房间302。没有任何风景，对着一个拆了的广告牌铁架子。。。我没明白为什么前台给我这间，也没有为此跟他们辩论，不愿意影响度假的心情。所以房间，环境，服务都给了1分。携程的介绍也过于简单了，也不清楚。,"I booked a luxurious room. I wonder why it is the innermost room of the innermost corner of the auxiliary building 302.Without any scenery, facing a demolished advertising brand iron shelf.EssenceEssenceI didn't understand why the front desk gave me this, nor did she debate with them, and was unwilling to affect the mood of vacation.Therefore, rooms, environment, and services have given 1 point.The introduction of Ctrip is too simple and unclear."

I knew these people at the front desk, but every time I moved in, the front desk was cold, regardless of whether men and women lowered their heads, and didn't even say what they were doing.This is the only 4 -star hotel I have ever seen. I only say it after checkout. If you never say it, welcome to come next time.I have observed for 10 minutes. The few of them during this period, the last sentence was ‘OK’, and most of them do n’t look at the guests, but just sorting out things on their hands.In addition, the room is too dim and depressed."
0,地理位置不错，距离商业中心政治中心和黄河都很近。但是服务太差，连东部地区的三星都不如。1。白天门童公然和闲人说话而不招呼客人2。在酒店住了2天，没有一个服务人员遇到的时候主动说“你好”3。早餐太差，品种少，服务差。如果不主动要，是不会有服务员问你是否要咖啡的，而煎蛋的厨师更是绝大多数时候都不知去向，在的时候也态度很差。4。酒店开业时间不长，但是地毯等都很脏了，连棉签也没有。5。酒店结构奇怪，感觉象是按政府办公楼设计的。6。电梯速度非常慢，一共3个客梯，控制纽居然不是联网的。7。任何人都可以用客梯，我就见过送快递的、送饭的等人。8。大堂副理/经理的位置是空的，只见过几个军人经常坐在那里，好奇怪。总而言之是一个非常不愉快的经历。我是8月18日入住的飞天大酒店，后来因为觉得太旧了而在21号换了这个酒店。但是这个酒店比飞天大酒店可差多了，真是一个错误的决定。（可以参见我在飞天大酒店的评价）补充点评2006年8月23日：大床房的大床根本就不大，最惊奇的是早晨服务员收拾好房间后，我回去一看，椅子还是我走时候的样子，根本没复原，而我扔在地上的一次性拖鞋的塑料袋子居然都没有收走。根本没有开夜床的服务。水的桶装水，有一次水没有了，我打电话20分钟后才送过来。太差了，建议不要住。,"The geographical location is good, which is very close to the political center of the commercial center and the Yellow River.But the service is too bad, and even Samsung in the Eastern region is not as good.1.During the daymen, Tongsong talked to his idlers without greeting Guest 2.After staying at the hotel for 2 days, no service staff actively said ""Hello"" when he met.Breakfast is too poor, there are few varieties, and the service is poor.If you do n’t take the initiative, there will be no waiters asking if you want coffee, and the chef of fried eggs will not know the direction most of the time, and the attitude is poor when you are.4.The hotel has not opened for a long time, but the carpets are dirty, and there is no cotton swab.5.The hotel structure is strange, it feels like it is designed according to the government office building.6.The elevator is very slow, with a total of 3 guest ladders, which is not connected to New.7.Anyone can use the guest ladder, and I have seen people who send courier and meals.8.The position of the deputy manager/manager of the lobby is empty, and I have only seen several soldiers sitting there, which is strange.All in all is a very unpleasant experience.I was at the Flying Hotel staying on August 18th. Later, I changed the hotel on the 21st because I felt too old.But this hotel is much worse than Feitian Hotel, it is really a wrong decision.(See the evaluation of my at the Flying Hotel.) Supplementary comment on August 23, 2006: The big bed in the big bed room is not large at all. The most surprising thing is that after the waiter cleaned up the room in the morning, I went back to see. The chair was still me.When I walked, I didn't recover at all, and the plastic bags of the disposable slippers I threw on the ground did not take away.There is no service to open the night bed at all.The water of the water was water, and once the water was gone, I called it for 20 minutes.It's too bad, it is recommended not to live."
0,"一.房间外面是中央空调外机的声音.无法入睡二.酒店服务员好象都是别人欠她钱的表情,不过对那些小日本却非常热情.三.酒店送的早餐品种小也就吧了,但是卫生非常不干净那些碗筷根本和没有洗一样.四.这样的酒店以后免费也不住了.","1. Outside the room is the sound of the central air -conditioning machine. I can't sleep. 2. The hotel waiters seem to be an expression that others owe her money, but they are very enthusiastic about those small Japan. 3. The breed of breakfast sent by the hotel is small., But the hygiene is very unclean. Those tableware is the same as that of not washing. 4. This hotel will not be free of charge in the future."
0,酒店的硬件一般，服务较差。因为我们带小孩是自助游方式，怕万一来不及回来，要求先退一个房，另一个我们退房延至下午一点，前台说不能，只能多保留十分钟，要不就要收半天房。最后我们先退了一个房，把东西全搬到另一房间，并开了请勿打扰灯和挂了“请勿打扰”的告示牌，可当我们上午十一点回来，我们用自己的房卡竟不能进自己房间，而且关了请勿打扰灯，摘了告示牌。问总台，说是我们的卡已被改了，可我们东西还放在房内，竟有此等事情？而且还没到中午十二点呀！！,"The hotel's hardware is average and the service is poor.Because we bring children to travel by self -service, I am afraid that if we come back, we are required to retreat first, and the other is our check -out until one o'clock in the afternoon. The front desk said that we could n’t, we can only keep it for ten minutes, or we have to collect a half -day room.Finally, we retreated one room, moved everything to the other room, and opened the notice sign of the lamp and hanging the ""don't disturb"", but when we came back at 11 am, we used our own room to use our own roomThe card can't enter your own room, and please don't disturb the lights and pick up the notice.Ask the head station, saying that our card has been changed, but our things are still placed in the room. Is there such things?And it's not until 12 noon!Intersection"
0,我入住的饭店装修陈旧，中央空调晚上冻得还要给服务生要被子，害得我都感冒了。四星有名无实！！,"The restaurant I stayed in was old. The central air conditioner was frozen at night and asked the waiter for a quilt, which made me a cold.Four stars are famous!Intersection"
0,发誓，再不住这个酒店，服务非常差，4星级酒店没有门童开门，接行李。只有保安催TAXI马上离开，哪怕我们的行李还在后箱！！！！补充点评2006年9月1日：哎，反正瑞安这个城市的印象非常不好，TAXI经常拒载，脾气也非常不好，城市又很脏，服务是全国最差！,"Swear that this hotel can no longer be available. The service is very poor. 4 -star hotels do not have the door to open the door and pick up their luggage.Only security urges TAXI to leave immediately, even if our luggage is still in the back box!IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionSupplementary comment on September 1, 2006: Hey, anyway, the impression of the city of Ruian is very bad, TAXI often refuses to load, his temper is very bad, the city is dirty, and the service is the worst in the country!"
0,无论从任何角度讲，该酒店最多只能评为2星级。携程首先推荐该酒店，我认为只有一个原因：酒店的返点最高？补充点评2008年3月11日：教训！,"No matter from any perspective, the hotel can only be rated as 2 stars at most.Ctrip first recommends the hotel. I think there is only one reason: the hotel's return point is the highest?Supplementary comment on March 11, 2008: Lesson!"

0,房间的环境不好!阴暗潮湿!一点不像星级的宾馆!失望.不过服务还是可以的!,The environment of the room is not good! Dark and humid! It's not like a star hotel! Disappointed. But the service is still possible!
0,在胡同里，不过还算好找。房价便宜，酒店设施简单，但还比较干净，离北京火车站很近，步行都可以。出胡同口就有小吃店，如果要离火车站近，可以选这。补充点评2008年4月21日：之前给的点评错误，因为看错宾馆名字。北京东方和平宾馆这家酒店给我感觉不好，虽然地段好，就靠王府井大街，但退房速度慢，房间隔音不好，有味道，看上去不干净。下次不会去了。,"In the alley, it's easy to find.House prices are cheap, hotel facilities are simple, but they are relatively clean. It is close to Beijing Railway Station and can be walked.There is a snack bar out of the Hutong. If you want to be close to the train station, you can choose this.Supplementary comment on April 21, 2008: The previous review error, because the name of the hotel is wrong.This hotel in Beijing Oriental Heping Hotel feels bad. Although the location is good, it depends on Wangfujing Street.I won't go next time."
0,前台服务人员的态度差到极点！下次绝对不会再入住这家酒店了。,The attitude of the front desk service staff is extremely poor!I will never stay in this hotel next time.
0,好烂的酒店，说是宾馆，感觉一点不好，大堂在一边像个临时的，门口没有任何安保人员，窗户旁边就是停放自行车的，毫无安全感。酒店设施陈旧，床又小又难睡，不提供纯净水，烧水非常难喝。卫生间的条件连好点的招待所都不如。早餐样式少还难吃。这是住过得最差的星级酒店，跟经济性快捷酒店都没法比。真不知道携程为什么会推荐。,"The bad hotel said that it was a hotel, and it felt bad at all. The lobby was like a temporary side. There was no security personnel at the door. The bicycle was parked next to the window. There was no sense of security.The hotel facilities are old, the beds are small and difficult to sleep, it does not provide pure water, and it is very difficult to drink water.The conditions of the bathroom are not as good as a better guest house.Breakfast style is small and unpalatable.This is the worst star hotel, which is not comparable to the Economic Express Hotel.I really don't know why Ctrip recommended."
0,出于我第一次住上像这样的所谓3星级酒店，我也来说两句。。。蓝天实在是太烂了，房间程度还是过的去，但是服务态度简直就是垃圾级的；宽带不好使，晚上直接就是不能用了，问了说是出故障；中午要了份意大利牛肉粉吃了差点没吐出来；白天忙着应酬、签完协议回来，晚上性骚扰的电话响了N次；说到气人的事了：早上退房，总服务台联系楼层，第一次楼层说我喝了矿泉水，我就直接告诉总服务台房间里面什么都没有，可能吗？接着楼层又说我喝了可乐？？？晕死了。。。第三次楼层又说我把卫生间的避孕套的盒子给拆了？？？？？？差点没我给气死了。。。我火了就问了到底是怎么回事，就你们这样还是3星级的酒店？？后来装了个样查了查说是7月5日的住客消费了。。。呵呵。。。足足等了20分钟才弄清楚。同时也让开车来送我去机场的朋友在那站了20分钟看着。。。真冒汗了。。。,"For the first time I lived in a so -called 3 -star hotel like this, I also said a few words.EssenceEssenceThe blue sky is too bad, the room level is still passing, but the service attitude is simply garbage level; the broadband is not easy to use, it can be used directly at night.I almost didn't spit it out; I was busy with entertainment during the day and the agreement after signing, and the call of sexual harassment at night rang N times; when it comes to a fierce thing: check out in the morning, the general service desk is connected to the floor, the first floor said that I drank me to drinkAfter mineral water, I directly told the total service desk room in the room.

0,岱宗这个三星领教一次就够了，是这样的，这种酒店应该马上从携程的合作客户中去掉，携程应该给我们最好的推荐，而不是这种所谓的三星，简直是比招待所还不如，让我们不敢相信携程的推荐是很不值得的事情。,"This Samsung is enough to teach this Samsung. That's it. This kind of hotel should immediately remove it from Ctrip's cooperative customers. Ctrip should give us the best recommendation, rather than this so -called Samsung.Let us dare not believe that Ctrip's recommendation is not worth it."
0,酒店很安静，去旅游区很适合住这里，步行几分钟就是景区的秦堰楼入口。在市里办事就远了。酒店有几个问题，一是当天入住由于客人少，锅炉房根本没有少开水，前台还有服务员还一直让我们把水开开开多流一会就会热，结果流了10分钟也是凉水，第二天有那么几个人来住了才稍微有一点点温温水。二是同样由于住的人少，酒店早餐没有自助餐，服务员给你打一碟小菜，几个馒头。酒店就是环境比较舒服，而且这里吃饭米饭非常好吃，注意。,"The hotel is very quiet. It is very suitable for living in the tourist area. It is the entrance of Qinyan Tower in the scenic area for a few minutes.It is far away in the city.There are several problems in the hotel. One is that because there are few guests on the same day, there are no less water at all. The front desk and waiters will keep us on the water. It will be hot for a while.On the next day, there were a few people who came to live a little bit of warm water.The second is that because there are few people who live, there are no buffets in the hotel breakfast. The waiter will give you a plate of side dishes and a few steamed buns.The hotel is more comfortable with the environment, and it is very delicious to eat and rice here. Pay attention."
0,如果你住习惯了五星酒店的话，最好不要住这家了，价格五星，价值顶多四星，太滥了！我们住的还是超级豪华房，床柜什么的都像招待所，电视还是23的大屁股老款，更要命的是服务员会象征性的敲几下门就直接进来，吓死人了，还从没见过不等我们开门而自己打开就进来的，相当不满意了！（不过好像汕头也没什么更好的酒店了，呵呵）,"If you live in a five -star hotel, it is best not to live in this house. The price is five stars, and the value is at most four stars.We still live in a super luxurious room. The bedside cabinets are like a guest house. The TV is still the old buttocks of 23. The more terrible is that the waiter will knock on the door symbolically and then come in.It is quite dissatisfied when we open the door and open ourselves!(But it seems that there is no better hotel in Shantou, haha)"
0,不像三星的酒店，根本就是一个2星的酒店啊,"Unlike Samsung's hotel, it is a 2 -star hotel at all"
0,说实话，这个酒店比较差，去天津时预先看了下酒店地址，富蓝特就在机场大巴终点站附近，比较近所以选择了它可后来太失望了，房间很小不说，还是木阁楼的，吵的不得了（不排除特价房的原因），那时天气还比较凉，浴室洗澡水竟然是冷的，服务员说多要放会水，就这样放了10分钟也没见热多少。听说天津的酒店都不怎么的，我就坚持凑合在这住了两宿，后来去对面的友谊之家看了下朋友，发现那边很不错。在天津的最后一晚，选择了那边，比富蓝特便宜环境又好，房间很大，卫浴设施不错，服务也不错。亲身经历，客观评价，希望酒店能改进。。。,"To be honest, this hotel is relatively poor. When I went to Tianjin, I saw the address of the hotel in advance. Fanta Lante was near the airport bus terminal. It was closer to choose it. It was too disappointed. The room was very small.It is so noisy (the reason for the special room) is cooler. At that time, the weather was cooler, and the bathroom bathing water turned out to be cold. The waiter said that he would have to put more water, and he didn't see much about it for 10 minutes.I heard that the hotels in Tianjin are not so good, so I insisted on living here for two places. Later, I went to the friendship house on the opposite side to see my friends and found that it was very good.On the last night of Tianjin, I chose over there. It is cheaper than Franite, the room is very large, the bathroom facilities are good, and the service is good.Personal experience and objective evaluation, I hope the hotel can be improved.EssenceEssence"
0,这个酒店是我住的酒店里最最差的，居然在半夜里装修，给前台打电话居然说，他没听见，不知道他是聋子还是傻子，那么吵闹的电转声音竟然没有听见，我上到五星下到招待所都住过，还没见过半夜三点装修的呢，大家千万别上当了，支持下啊！,"This hotel is the worst in the hotel where I live. I was renovated in the middle of the night. I called the front desk and said that he didn't hear it. I don't know if he was deaf or a fool.Five -star has lived in the guest house, and I haven't seen the decoration in the middle of the night. Don't be fooled. With support!"
0,08年8月19日我和先生、儿子入住武夷茶苑大酒店，房间空调不足，我们开窗通风，（窗为平移窗，打开后无法上锁）窗外环境极差，到处是垃圾堆、乱石堆。20日上午7点我的挎包和先生的手表失窃，报警立案，为小偷爬窗入室偷窃。这使我全家遭受不小的经济和精神损失（今后再也不敢住酒店一楼，惨痛的教训！我还很后怕地想，幸亏钱包内有不少现金，如果贼偷不到钱，狗急跳墙，我全家人的安全...）。由此可见，一家酒店能让窃贼登堂入室，其保安工作质量是相当差的，客人的人身安全也时刻受到威胁。而且，当我们发现失窃报总台后，保安人员却迟迟不到现场，我们最后只能自己报警。这次经历让我对武夷山的民风产生了疑惑，并且对该酒店的服务无法满意，对中、高层某些管理人员的态度感到气愤（一再强调我们住客该对被偷自负一定责任）。这是我住过的最糟糕的一家酒店也是我经历过的最糟糕的一次旅游！,"On August 19, 2008, my husband and son and I stayed at Wuyi Tea Garden Hotel. The room air conditioner was insufficient. We opened the window to ventilate.Stone pile.At 7 am on the 20th, my shoulder bag and my husband's watches were stolen, the police filed a case, climbing the window for the thief to steal the room.This caused my family to suffer a lot of economic and mental losses (I dare not stay on the first floor of the hotel in the future, the painful lesson! I still fear that there are a lot of cash in the wallet.The safety of my whole family ...).It can be seen that a hotel allows the thief to enter the room. The quality of the security work is quite poor, and the personal safety of the guests is always threatened.Moreover, when we found that the theft was reported, the security guards were too late to the scene, and we could only call the police ourselves.This experience made me doubt about the folk customs of Wuyi Mountain, and could not be satisfied with the hotel's services. I was angry with some managers in the middle and senior management (repeatedly emphasized that our residents should be stolen for certain responsibilities).This is the worst hotel I have ever lived in the worst travel I have experienced!"
0,早上7点半到的酒店，本来要等12点才能checkin，但前台说可以提前让我们进房间，本来印象还不错。但进了房间一看，中央空调没冷气，交涉，说中午12点会有，想想也算了。下午玩好回来，5点半这样，照样没冷气，交涉，又改说机房检修，晚上7点会有。向携程投诉。过了会酒店又给回音说晚上电路会跳闸，所以目前中央空调没开，可能七八点会有。言辞反复，没个准信，令人气愤，还是三星级的酒店。晚上餐厅用餐，点了香鸭汤，结果上的是鸡汤，服务员还理直气壮说你们点的就是鸡汤，问拿来单子看，服务员自己将香鸭两字涂去，写上山鸡。。。。faint这样的服务水准竟然还是3星级，是我住过的所有酒店里服务最差的，而且离景区又远，交通十分不便,"At 7:30 in the morning, the hotel originally had to wait at 12 o'clock to checkin, but the front desk said that we could let us enter the room in advance. The impression was not bad.But after entering the room, there was no air conditioner in the central air conditioner. It was negotiated and said that there would be at 12 noon. If you think about it.Play it back in the afternoon, this is 5:30, there is no air -conditioning, negotiating, and renovating the maintenance of the computer room, there will be at 7 pm.Complaint with Ctrip.After the meeting, the hotel also told the echo that the circuit will stick to the night, so the central air conditioner is not turned on, and it may be seven or eight.Repeated words, no letter, are angry, or a three -star hotel.In the evening, the restaurant died and ordered the fragrant duck soup. As a result, the chicken soup was on. The waiter also said that you ordered the chicken soup.

0,并不是雨季，但仍旧是一股浓重的霉味。被子阴冷潮湿，空调也不开，没有任何取暖设备。在没有任何人排队的情况下，结帐花了至少15分钟。两个收银员打了个查房的电话上去后就开始自顾自聊天了，直到过了很久收到查房反馈后才带着一脸没睡醒的表情心不在焉地开始翻找预授权资料以及打印帐单和找发票本。本店员工难道不知道他们自己店的走廊是史上最长走廊，查房走过去要花很久吗？在一再提醒下才不情愿地打电话去催查房结果，就不懂得先把那些票据找出来。让人不得不联想到她们是不是没领到年终奖。明明早餐厅门口有人收餐券的，落座后还是有人上来一个个问有没有餐券，以己度人。补充点评2008年2月21日：忘了一点：最近拖鞋被换成了非一次性的，实在怀疑有没有真正的消毒干净。因为整个酒店就给人感觉霉霉的，旧旧的，不是那么清爽。如果得了脚气，他们是头号嫌疑犯。,"It is not the rainy season, but it is still a strong mold.The quilt is cold and humid, the air conditioner is not turned on, and there is no heating equipment.With no one queuing, it took at least 15 minutes to checkout.After the two cashiers called a check -up, they started chatting and talked about themselves. It was not until a long time after receiving the inspection room feedback, and then I started to find pre -authorized information and start to find pre -authorized information andPrint bills and find invoice books.Doesn't this shop employee know that the corridor of their own shop is the longest corridor in history. Does it take a long time to walk around?With repeated reminders, I reluctantly called to urge the results of the house, and I did not know how to find out those bills first.People have to think of whether they have not received the year -end award.Obviously, there were people who received a meal coupon at the door of the breakfast restaurant.Supplementary comment on February 21, 2008: I forgot one thing: recently the slippers have been replaced by non -one -time, which is really doubtful whether it is really disinfected and clean.Because the entire hotel feels moldy, old, not so refreshing.If they get athlete, they are the number one suspect."
0,个人认为携程推荐此宾馆是不注重会员的基本利益。该酒店一半房间临大马路，晚上很吵，使人无法入睡。每次预定，该酒店总是声称无法保证安排安静和有宽带的房间，明显不重视携程的客人。本人已在该酒店经历了多次可怕的预订过程，携程的协调能力始终使客人深感失望，希望携程在赚钱的同时真正为会员的利益着想，不要推荐这样服务死板的酒店，本人今后决不入住该酒店。,"Personally, Ctrip recommends that this hotel does not pay attention to the basic interests of members.The hotel's half of the room was on the road, and it was very noisy at night, making people unable to fall asleep.Each time the hotel always claims to be unable to guarantee a quiet and broadband room, it obviously does not pay attention to Ctrip's guests.I have experienced many terrible booking process at the hotel. Ctrip's coordination ability has always been disappointed. I hope Ctrip will really think about the interests of members while making money. Don't recommend such a hotel to a rigid.Check in the hotel."
0,"这次入住和上次相比,感觉差很多啊...卫生间马桶一直漏水,早上打扫房间服务员简直像抄家一样,搞的整个楼层都鸡犬不宁,想多睡一会儿都不行;晚上2层的KTV音响一直闹到半夜,住在3层的我不但没法睡觉,连听电视的声音都有困难.下次再去扬州,我肯定要换个酒店了.","Compared with the last time, I feel a lot worse than the last time ... The toilet toilet has been leaking. The western waiter in the morning is like copying the house. The entire floor is restless.I have been making trouble until midnight. I live in the 3rd floor. I ’m not only ca n’t sleep, but I’ m difficult to listen to TV. I ’m going to Yangzhou next time, I will definitely change the hotel."
0,酒店比价破，房间比较老，地毯上还有以前客人留下的瓜子壳，服务员是怎么打扫房间的?毛巾上有烟味，隔音很差，听得到隔壁的电视和门外人的谈话。厕所也有点脏，那个防滑地毯不但扎人脚，还发霉了。说是3星酒店，我看最多也就2星，但是地理位置还行，就在繁华地段，不过扬州也小，住在哪里都差不多。因为带女儿出来玩，所以加了一张床，要不是汉庭和莫泰不能加床，也不会住到这里，反正就是马马虎虎，差强人意。,"The hotel is more than the price, the room is older, and there is the melon seed shell left by the guests on the carpet. How does the waiter clean the room? There is a smoke smell on the towel, and the sound insulation is poor.The toilet was also a bit dirty. The non -slip carpet was not only tied, but also moldy.It is a 3 -star hotel. I think it is 2 stars at most, but the geographical location is okay. It is in a prosperous area, but Yangzhou is also small and lives almost everywhere.Because I took my daughter out to play, I added a bed. If it wasn't for Han Ting and Mo Tai, they could not add bed, nor would they live here."
0,房间比较陈旧，没有无烟层，商务间和会议室在一起，白天环境很差，早餐非常简陋，服务态度先不说，单就服务质量而言就很不令人满意，客人大部分都是国内来开会的，不推荐个人旅行者入住。,"The room is relatively old, there is no smoke -free layer. The business room and the conference room are together. The environment is very poor during the day. The breakfast is very simple. The service attitude is not satisfactory.Those who come to meet in China do not recommend personal travelers to stay."
0,请各位注意酒店提供的饮用水是自来水，这是前台服务员说的。所以各位千万不能生喝酒店提供的饮用水。2008年了，北京的酒店还是这种水平，真是令人心寒。,"Please note that the drinking water provided by the hotel is tap water, which is what the front desk waiter said.So you must not drink drinking water provided by hotels.In 2008, the hotel in Beijing is still a kind of level."
0,（1）酒店册子介绍说房间内提供饮用水，水壶内没有水，给前台提意见。前台说饮用水就是卫生间的自来水（太恶心了），可以叫服务员来为我加水。冰箱内150毫升的国产饮用水要收费10元（外面买也就1-2元的饮用水）。（2）房间内收费的物品非常多，拖鞋（有免费拖鞋），袜子，等等，还有会动的套套，盒子上的文字这么写的。想的这么周全，为什么不提供饮用水呢？即使按平价收费，顾客也是情愿的。（3）给大堂经理提意见，也是狡辩加爱理不理的。（4）房间内的加湿器，对我这个南方人非常好。,"(1) Hotel booklet said that drinking water provides drinking water in the room. There is no water in the kettle.The front desk said that drinking water is the tap water in the bathroom (too disgusting), and the waiter can add water to me.150 ml of domestic drinking water in the refrigerator cost 10 yuan (buying water at 1-2 yuan outside).(2) There are a lot of items charged in the room, slippers (free slippers), socks, etc., as well as mobilized sleeves, the text on the box is written like this.Thinking so well, why not provide drinking water?Even if it is charged at a parity, customers are willing.(3) Make opinions to the lobby manager, but also to quibble and ignore it.(4) The humidifier in the room is very good for me, a southerner."
0,第一次通过携程入住这个酒店公寓，酒店前台服务态度极端蛮横无礼。我是9月30日将近9点钟到酒店，原准备先放下行李就去看F1，可是前台接待生讲如果上午10点前入主还要再加收半天房费，说这是酒店规定。我让他找去找经理，他说找谁都没用，电脑已经设定了固定程序。我要求他告诉我上海黄金周的投诉电话，他说不知道。最后我打电话给携程，携程与酒店交涉一阵子后才给我办入住。这简直是岂有此理的规定，如果上午10点前入住要加收半天房费的话，酒店一天岂不可以收一天半的房费？忠告计划入住该酒店的各位，务必在预订时确认入住时间不加收房费。,"For the first time, I was in this hotel apartment through Ctrip, and the hotel's front desk service attitude was extremely rude.I arrived at the hotel nearly 9 o'clock on September 30. I was about to put down my luggage first to see F1, but the front desk reception was lectured. If I entered the host before 10 am, I would have to charge a half -day room fee.I asked him to find the manager. He said that it was useless to find anyone. The computer had set a fixed program.I asked him to tell me the complaint call of Shanghai Golden Week, and he said he didn't know.Finally, I called Ctrip. Ctrip and the hotel negotiated for a while before giving me a check -in.This is a rule. If you take a half -day house fee before 10 am, wouldn't the hotel be charged for a day and a half?Everyone who plans to stay in the hotel must be confirmed that the check -in time will not be charged at the time of booking."
0,"隔音效果很差,客人住在九楼,晚上四楼的KTV一直营业到一点,客人反应无法入睡.所以本来预计定三天,后来提前退房,换了酒店",The sound insulation effect is very poor. The guests live on the ninth floor. The KTV on the fourth floor in the evening has been open to a little. The guest's response cannot fall asleep.
0,酒店一般，最受不了的是骚扰电话，一晚上能响4～5回，而且每晚都会打来，只真对单身男客，信息非常准确，严重怀疑是小姐摆平了前台服务员，拿到客人的入住信息。在这样的房间住，心里很不踏实。,"The hotel is average. The most unbearable is the harassment phone. It can ring 4 to 5 times a night, and it will be played every night. It is really accurate to the single male guest. The information is very accurate. It is serious that the lady settled the front desk waiter and got the guests.Check information.Living in such a room is very unruly."
0,"兰州...一个我来了就不想再来的城市,第一天入住金轮宾馆,一肚子不满意,再一次要求携程整一个好点的,一样是四星级宾馆,西兰国际大酒店堪称兰州以及中国之最,最差的四星级非他莫属...晚上10点入住,手续办完上楼...天啊...没灯...摸了半天开了灯,由于太晚了,有些疲倦,想到进屋休息,没想到的是居然门卡打不开门,前前后后折腾了很久,终于用服务员的门卡开了门,停车场露天,还收费,还是那句话,请携程老总亲自入住一下你们推荐的宾馆,还是两个字:丢人","Lanzhou ...

Oh my ... no light ... I touched it for a long time to turn on the lights,Because it was too late, I was a little tired. I thought of entering the house to rest.

0,单人间太小了，居然要350元/天，杀猪呀！,"Single room is too small, it costs 350 yuan/day, kill pigs!"
0,办入住的时候，说没有收到携程的预定，但还是给了携程的价格。问了早餐的事情才给了餐卷，早餐很差，房间非常不干净，床上有西瓜子，床头柜后面还有吃剩的果冻的空盒。最可气的是退房的时候，结账之后没有把信用卡还给我，晚上吃饭结账的时候才发现。,"When I set up, I said that I did not receive Ctrip's booking, but it was given the price of Ctrip.I asked the meals for breakfast. The breakfast was very poor, the room was very unclean, there were watermelon seeds on the bed, and there were leftover jelly boxes behind the bedside table.The most annoying thing is that when checking out, I did not return the credit card to me after checkout, and I discovered only when I ate at night."
0,据说是太仓最好的酒店，作为一个5星级的酒店让我很失望。房间小而简单并且陈旧，最多也只是个3星水平；服务只是在入住的时候那个前台员工不错，其他就太差了：进出酒店时酒店员工和门童都是视而不见，没有任何表情更不要说是问候了，一次回到酒店时，前面就是一个穿黑色制服的女员工也往电梯间走去，我就跟在后面，当到了电梯间时她管自己转弯上了楼梯，也不给我按一下电梯--当时我可是两手拎着东西而她明明知道我跟在她后面。不过酒店的早餐还是可以的。估计下次不会去住了。,"It is said that it is the best hotel in Taicang. As a 5 -star hotel, I disappointed me.The room is small, simple and outdated, at most it is only a 3 -star level; the service is only good at the front desk employee when the service is, and the others are too bad: when entering and leaving the hotel, the hotel employees and door children are blind.It was a greeting. When I returned to the hotel once, a female employee wearing a black uniform went to the elevator room. I followed me. When I arrived at the elevator room, she turned to the stairs by herself.As soon as the elevator-at the time I was holding things with both hands and she knew that I was behind her.But the hotel's breakfast is still possible.It is estimated that I will not live next time."

0,酒店设施陈旧，服务员态度生硬，位置也较偏僻。,"The hotel facilities are old, the waiter is stiff, and the location is relatively remote."
0,酒店位置还好，设施太陈旧，太老了！房间面积太小，硬件的设施糟糕！枕头太低！床垫也硬！,"The hotel location is good, the facilities are too old, too old!The room area is too small, and the hardware facilities are bad!The pillow is too low!The mattress is also hard!"
0,"住了不少的酒店,一般过的去就不点评,这次实在是忍不住了,不少问题要反映下:1.地理位置地标不明显,司机找了半天,这个就不多说了2.到酒店门口,礼宾部人在旁边都不帮忙拿行李,(行!自己拿.)3.checkin搞了20分钟,有始以来最长的一次,(有点窝火了)4.客房走廊有异味,应该不是新装修的吧.房间里面也是一股味道,这点实在受不了.5.酒店工作人员看我,象见了鬼,各个底个头,招呼都不打.要不就是视而不见,更有看到礼宾的人员翘个脚在酒店的公用电话打电话.(无语)虽然不是星级酒店,设备差可以忍,但酒店管理和serves跟不上,就没有竞争力.下次到北京住如家也再不住这个宾馆了.","I have stayed with a lot of hotels, and I usually do n’t comment on it. This time I ca n’t help it. Many problems should be reflected: 1. The geographical location is not obvious. The driver found it for a long time.. At the entrance of the hotel, the people of the concierge department did not help take the luggage next to it, (walk!) 3.Checkin for 20 minutes, the longest one since the beginning, (a bit of fire) 4. The room corridor has a bad smell.It should not be a new decoration. The room is also a taste. This is really impossible to stand .5. The hotel staff looked at me, like seeing ghosts, all the bottoms, and the greeting.Seeing the ritual staff calling the public phone call at the hotel.

0,"服务态度相当差,我接触到的上海宾馆服务多半是这样,可能这是地域文化吧(不知道这句话算不算不文明用词)宾馆反馈2008年7月22日：尊敬的宾客您好!对于您在酒店遇到的不快我们深表歉意,我们真诚的希望每一位顾客都能在我们酒店度过一段美好的时光,如您在酒店遇到困难可第一时间联系酒店的大堂经理,我们会及时为您排忧解难,给您一个满意的回复,期待您的再次光临!","The service attitude is quite poor.

0,酒店位置离火车站有点远，房间环境非常一般，而且晚上环境太乱，尤其是前台结账简直慢的从来没见过，让我等了40分钟，以后坚决不住这里,"The hotel location is a bit far from the train station, the room environment is very average, and the environment at night is too chaotic, especially the front desk will never see it. Let me wait for 40 minutes."
0,住了普标，床小不去说，房间整体设施感觉象招待所，房间里还有一股以前房客留下的脚臭味。以后再也不住了。不过前台小姐的服务可圈可点！,"I lived in the general label, and I could n’t say that the overall facilities of the room felt like a guest house. There was also a foot odor left by the tenants in the room.I can't help it anymore in the future.But the service of the front desk is remarkable!"
0,熟悉的酒店都住满了，迫不得已又住了一次。发现更垃圾了。总之，如果不是迫不得已，千万不要住次酒店。枕头发黑，床单发黄，房间超级小，卫生间异味和公共厕所差不多，房间异味更不用说了。,"The familiar hotels were full, and they had to live again.Discover more garbage.In short, if it is not for it, don't stay in the hotel.The pillow is black, the bed is yellow, the room is super small, the bathroom odor is similar to the public toilet, let alone the odor of the room."
0,27日入住正赶上附近施工，第一印象不好，29日离开时，大厅有钢琴小提琴的表演。订房时（大/双）没得挑，入住时被告知是两间豪标双人间，其实想要一大一双。总之不尽如人意。,"On the 27th, I was catching up with the nearby construction. The first impression was not good. When I left on the 29th, there was a piano violin performance.When reservation, I did not have to pick (big/double), and was told that they were two bidders during the check -in. In fact, I wanted a big pair.In short, unsatisfactory."
0,一开始本来要预定凯悦的，后来助理搞错了，订了个君悦。简单评价以下。柜台服务态度还可以，就是房间特小。最不满意的就是宾馆的车队。一开始我预约了一台丰田皇冠，后来我要用车的时候，柜台告诉我皇冠车出去了，只有花冠，然后告诉我价格是450元，我只好订下了。过一会儿花冠车司机过来了，就说价格是550元，立马抬高价格，我觉得这不是钱的问题，而是宾馆的信用问题。中午时间，我要去吃饭，叫司机12：30过来接我，结果等到12：30，他没有出现。只能给君悦打电话了。最不可忍受的就是那个司机一直边打电话边开车，那天我用车用了5个多小时，其中3个小时以上，司机都是在打电话。如果入住君悦要用车的话，千万不要用君悦的车。素质极差。,"At first, I had to book Hyatt, but the assistant was mistakenly made by the assistant and ordered a Junyue.Simple evaluation below.The counter service attitude is okay, that is, the room is particularly small.The most dissatisfied is the hotel's team.At first I booked a Toyota Crown. Later, when I was going to use a car, the counter told me that the crown car was out, only the corolla, and then told me that the price was 450 yuan, and I had to order it.After a while, the driver of the flower crown car came, and the price was 550 yuan, and the price immediately raised the price. I think this is not a matter of money, but the credit problem of the hotel.At noon, I was going to eat, and I called the driver to pick me up at 12:30. As a result, when 12:30, he did not show up.I can only call Junyue.The most unbearable thing was that the driver kept calling and driving. I used the car for more than 5 hours that day, and for more than 3 hours, the driver was calling.If you want to use Junyue to use a car, do not use Junyue's car.The quality is extremely poor."
0,酒店设备陈旧，服务差劲，还不如二星级水准，更令人郁闷的是我早晨七点半下火车赶到酒店，却被告知要到九点方能入住，否则就要加半天房租。结果为了避免挨冻，多付了250元。结果携程还不算我的结分。真是冤透了。,"The hotel equipment is old, the service is poor, and the two -star level is not as good as the two -star level. What is even more depressed is that I rushed to the hotel at 7:30 in the morning, but was told that I could stay at nine o'clock, otherwise I would have a half -day rent.As a result, in order to avoid frozen, pay 250 yuan.As a result, Ctrip is not a knot.It's really wrong."
0,订的210的标A，酒店大堂和整体环境看起来还不错，但一进房间感觉太糟脏兮兮的臭臭的，卫生间看了都不想进去，所谓的宽带上网是提供一个什么电力宽带modem，根本就无法接通，在等了将近2小时，其间打了无数个电话投诉，仍然无法上网，后与大堂经理交涉不能上网要退房，被告知要我带着自己的电脑去其他楼层去试如果能上网的话可以调到那个楼层。被断然拒绝后大堂经理又提出调换到二楼，二楼是大家常用到的那种宽带，不用再接电力modem，不过要我们加钱，这时已经3个小时过去了，我们无力再去理论，后搬到二楼。一直以为调换的是标B的房型，后来退房的时候才知入住的是豪华房要400多，附近有几间经济型酒店才180，干净还能上网。新华的房价太贵了，而且携程的价格一点都不便宜，前台给其他客人的标A和标B才150和190块。以后不会来这里入住，周边的酒店要比这里好多了。,"The 20th bid A, the hotel lobby and the overall environment, it looks pretty good, but when I enter the room, it feels too bad and smelly. I do n’t want to enter the bathroom., I ca n’t connect it at all. I waited for nearly 2 hours. I had countless telephone complaints during the meter, and I still could n’t surf the Internet. After I negotiated with the lobby manager, I could n’t get out of the Internet.Try to go to that floor if you can surf the Internet.The lobby manager proposed to be replaced to the second floor. The second floor is the kind of broadband commonly used by everyone. There is no need to connect the power Modem, but we have to add money. At this time, it has passed.Then move to the second floor.I always thought that the room type of the bid B was always changed. Later, when I got out of the room, I realized that it was more than 400 luxury rooms. There were only 180 economical hotels nearby.Xinhua's house prices are too expensive, and Ctrip's price is not cheap at all. The front desk is only 150 and 190 for other guests A and Bid B.I won't come here to stay here in the future, the surrounding hotels are much better than here."
0,"酒店除了地理位置靠近火车站(50米)以外,没有任何可圈可点之处了,房间还算干净,但是设备和面积都不是很符合性价比,卫生间的马桶还有时堵塞;房费里包含的自助早餐更是差,还没到早餐结束时间,所有的盘子就都空了,只剩下咸菜和牛奶了...下次不会再住了.","Except for the geographical location close to the railway station (50 meters), there is no remarkable point. The room is clean, but the equipment and area are not very cost -effective. The toilet in the bathroom is sometimes blocked;The buffet breakfast is even worse.

0,"6月23日中午12点进入酒店，说明是通过携程预定了酒店客房。随后就碰到了很不爽的经历：一个面无笑容的戴眼镜的服务台接待冷冷的说：贵姓。回答之后便继续冷言：那里办手续。她用手指了一下另外一个正在帮助住客做登记的服务员。我走过去之后，稍等了片刻，另一位接待便热情的开始帮我做登记。因为付款方式我选择了刷卡，这位前台让我到那个冰冷接待那里去划卡，当然我此时是比较不愉快，但卡机在那头，只得又走回去。如果说服务业人员用无笑容的表情，冰冷的话语做接待是很正常的话，那么过分的事情在之后便开始了。刷完我的卡之后，我的卡是被扔到桌面上的；让我签字的笔是拍到桌子上，发出了很响的一声；信用卡留存单也不肯送到我手里，要自己取；最愤怒的是当我对这个接待说：把留存单送过来的时候。她便摔门到办公室去了。镇江大酒店，一个号称三星级的酒店是这样的服务。当之后我把大堂副理叫过来的时候，副理侧着身，趴在前台上跟我说：这个服务员就是这样的，我们拿她没办法，我代她道歉，对不起，好吧？真是无语了，“对不起，好吧？”刚到镇江就碰到这样的事情，我还能说什么呢？这是我的经历，各位看过就当是一个经验吧。补充点评2007年7月23日：提高服务水平，提升服务意识是服务业，特别是旅游城市服务业尤其应该重视的问题。虽说我只是众多旅客中的少少一名而已，但我便碰到了这样的状况，镇江大酒店的确需要有很大的改善，三星级要有三星级的样子！看到酒店的回复，我感到很欣慰：和气生财，欲生财者，则礼者不可不学也。宾馆反馈2007年7月13日：关于您反映的事情，酒店领导高度重视，立刻召开全体客房员工及所有管理人员会议，对当事员工进行了批评教育并进行了经济处罚，该员工也认识到自己的服务意识较差,并保证在今后的工作中提高服务质量和意识，努力做好对客服务工作。为杜绝此类事件的再次发生，酒店人力资源部对全体管理人员和客房员工进行了岗位机能、服务机能和管理机能的再培训，努力提高酒店的服务质量。我们再次真诚的向您致歉，并希望您能再次人住镇江大酒店。","Entering the hotel at 12 noon on June 23rd, it was indicated that the hotel room was booked through Ctrip.Later, I met a very uncomfortable experience: a service desk of wearing glasses without a smile received a cold say: Gui surname.After answering, I continued to say cold words: where to do the formalities there.She pointed her finger another waiter who was helping the residents to register.After I walked over, I waited a while, and the other reception began to help me register enthusiastically.I chose to swipe the card because of the payment method. The front desk asked me to go to the cold reception to draw the card. Of course, I was unhappy at this time, but the card machine had to go back there.If the service industry personnel useless of a smile, it is normal to receive the cold words, then the excessive things begin later.After swiping my card, my card was thrown on the desktop; the pen I signed was to take a shot on the table, and a loud noise was made;Take; the most angry is when I said to this reception: when I send the retention sheet over.She fell to the office.Zhenjiang Hotel, a hotel that is known as a three -star is such a service.When I called the deputy manager of the lobby later, the deputy manager sideways and lay on the front desk and told me: This is the case. We can't help but apologize for her. Sorry, okay?It's speechless, ""I'm sorry, okay?"" As soon as I came to Zhenjiang, I encountered such a thing. What else can I say?This is my experience. I have seen it as an experience.Supplementary comment on July 23, 2007: It is a service industry to raise the level of service and enhance service awareness, especially the tourist city service industry.Although I am just one of many passengers, I encountered such a situation. The Zhenjiang Hotel really needs to improve greatly. Samsung should have a three -star look!Seeing the hotel's reply, I feel very pleased: those who want to make money and want to have a fortune, then the courtesy must not be learned.Hotel feedback on July 13, 2007: Regarding what you reflected, hotel leaders attach great importance to it, and immediately convene a meeting of all guest room employees and all managers.His service awareness is poor, and it is guaranteed to improve service quality and consciousness in future work, and strive to do a good job of service to customers.In order to prevent such incidents occur again, the Ministry of Human Resources of the Hotel has re -training the job functions, service functions and management functions of all managers and room employees, and strive to improve the quality of the hotel's service.We apologize to you sincerely and hope that you can live in Zhenjiang Hotel again."
0,房间较旧，墙纸有霉变。环境一般，感觉不象携程上介绍的那样古色古香，而是感觉破旧不堪。不过周围交通比较方便，离景点和汽车站都很近。,"The room is older and the wallpaper is mildew.The environment is average, and it feels as antique as introduced on Ctrip, but it feels dilapidated.However, the surrounding traffic is more convenient, and the attractions and bus stations are very close."
0,酒店设施陈旧，估计已经10年没有更新。壁纸、浴缸漆面剥落，马桶盖已损坏，空调系统基本瘫痪，噪音较大暖风几乎没有，入住酒店其内部停车场仍要收费。建议偕程应定期对推荐酒店进行筛选，合格酒店进行保留，不合格酒店进行剔除，这样才能保证服务的总体品质。,"The hotel facilities are outdated, and it is estimated that it has not been updated for 10 years.The paint surface of the wallpaper and bathtub is peeled off, the toilet lid has been damaged, the air -conditioning system is basically paralyzed, the noise is almost no, and there is almost no warm air. The internal parking lot of the hotel is still charged.It is recommended that Cheng Cheng should regularly screen the recommended hotel, keep the qualified hotel, and eliminate unqualified hotels to ensure the overall quality of the service."
0,第一次去河南省、第一次去郑州，印象一般。入住的大河锦江饭店，据了解已经和上海的锦江集团脱离了合作关系。酒店房间很大，但设施已经较为陈旧，同样是“豪华大床房”有些房间有“沙发”，有些房间无沙发，只有二把椅子。,"I went to Henan Province for the first time and the first time to Zhengzhou.The Dahe Jinjiang Hotel who stayed in, it is understood that it has been separated from the cooperative relationship with the Jinjiang Group in Shanghai.The hotel rooms are large, but the facilities are relatively old. It is also the ""luxury large bed room"" in some rooms with ""sofas"". Some rooms have no sofas and only two chairs."

0,有那么多朋友点评钻石公寓，不妨再讲两句。钻石新推出的“特价”双人房，其实一点也不特价。以前有国外朋友来上海，一直比较推荐钻石，他们也比较满意。但这次7月上旬的入住新推出的特价双人房，朋友反映房间比以前小多了，总体比以前的的套房差多了。订房的时候，双特价人房和套房的价格只相差几十元，但实际情况却相差很大，我认为这是钻石在忽悠客人。,"There are so many friends to comment on diamond apartments, and you may wish to say two more words.The new ""special"" double room launched by diamonds is actually not special at all.In the past, foreign friends came to Shanghai and have been recommended for diamonds, and they are also satisfied.But this time in early July, the newly launched special double rooms were launched. Friends reported that the room was much smaller than before, and overall is much worse than the previous suite.When reservation, the price of double special rooms and suite is only tens of yuan, but the actual situation is very different. I think this is a diamond in the flickering guest."
0,此次入住简直就是失望到愤怒的过程。先是晚上11点到酒店，竟然被告知没房了--我可是当天下午用信用卡担保过的！接下来就是前台和携程联系，等了将近1个小时才进到房间，看到房间的设施，只有两个字：失望！而且当时我告知前台，第二天还有一个老外入住，希望把房间保留到晚上，前台满口答应。次日晚上带老外入住，又告诉我没房！！又联系确认了半天，最终给找了两张单人床的小房间，而且窗户就对着早餐餐厅！真的愤怒了。这种水平的酒店如何能被大家评为4分？？！要不是展览会期间酒店不好找，早就住1晚就退房了！宾馆反馈2008年5月28日：尊敬的宾客您好：感谢您的光临以及您的宝贵意见，我们对给您造成的困扰表示非常抱歉，我们会加强对员工的培训来提高服务质量，避免同类问题再发生，期待您的再次光临。,"This time I stayed was just a process of disappointment to anger.First I arrived at the hotel at 11 pm, and I was told that I had no room-I had guaranteed it with a credit card that afternoon!The next step is to contact the front desk and Ctrip. I have waited for nearly an hour to enter the room. I saw the facilities in the room, only two words: disappointment!And at the time, I informed the front desk that there was a foreigner staying the next day, hoping to keep the room until the evening, and the front desk agreed.The next night he took the foreigner to stay in and told me that there was no room!IntersectionI contacted and confirmed for a long time, and finally found two small rooms for single beds, and the window faced the breakfast restaurant!Really angry.How can this level of hotels be rated as 4 points?IntersectionIntersectionIf the hotel was not easy to find during the exhibition, I would have been out of the room for 1 night!Hotel feedback on May 28, 2008: Dear guests: Thank you for your coming and your valuable opinions.

We will strengthen the training of employees to improve the quality of service and avoid the same kind.The problem happens again, and you look forward to your visit again."
0,从04年到06年，常带同事和家人住在主楼1号楼。此次CHECK－IN时，被告知住在2号楼，2号楼没有电梯，带着3岁的小孩很麻烦，另外窗外不象1号楼有风景、房间设置陈旧，价格却与1号楼一样，有一种上当的感觉，将来如果不能事先确认，不打算住在这个酒店了。,"From 2004 to 2006, colleagues and family often lived in Building 1 of the main building.At this time, I was told to live in Building 2. There was no elevator in Building 2. It was troublesome to bring a 3 -year -old child.Similarly, there is a feeling of being upright.

The traffic is inconvenient; 2. It is a five -star level, but it does not meet the five -star standard at all.Some people's attitude is really too bad. The day I arrived was just 5.12. On the day of the Sichuan earthquake, I only arrived at nearly 8 pm. When it was that, the service staff said that he did not receive the reservation. (At that timeMany, most locals come here to avoid it, because this hotel is newly opened, the floor is not high, so there is no empty room at that time). I heard it again and asked them to confirm it again again.Patient, I also sent a little temper to me. When I called Ctrip, there was a male waiter who was still laughing, and the kind of joy and disaster. Later, CTIRP confirmed that there was this order.I didn't hand over it. I would never go there again. I must not go ..."
0,一开始住在7楼，正对2个工地，本来想市区施工到10点也就停工了，可苦苦等到0点不见停，巨大的桩机声响搞得无法入睡，玩了一天累啊！后来叫总台换房间，总台居然说只有标准房了，我爱人和宝宝挤一个单人床，一晚没睡好，酒店还不肯退差价。,"At first I lived on the 7th floor and faced the two construction sites. I wanted to stop working until 10 o'clock in the urban area, but I couldn't stop waiting at 0 o'clock.IntersectionLater, I called the main station to change the room. The main station actually said that there were only standard rooms. My lover and my baby squeezed a single bed. I didn't sleep well all night, and the hotel refused to refund the difference."
0,"2月20日通过携程订的房,结果告之没有普通标房只有行政标间,入住后发现什么行政标间,根本就是普通标房吗.估计酒店和携程在打马虎眼,298的价格实在不值.后来逛街看见四星级的漳州大酒店,真后悔没住那儿只不过贵100元.还有退房时居然以侄子流鼻血弄脏了被子为由要加收洗衣费.鄙视~~","On February 20th, the house ordered the house through Ctrip. As a result, there was no ordinary standard room. There was only an administrative standard room. After checking in, what administrative standard room was found? Is it a normal standard room? It is estimated that the hotel and Ctrip are playing sloppy eyes. The price of 298 is not worth it.. Later, when I saw a four -star Zhangzhou Hotel, I really regret not staying there just 100 yuan. And when checking out, I actually received a laundry fee for the quilt on the grounds of the nephew nosebleed. I despise it."
0,作为商务经济连锁型酒店，总体还是过得去的，在这样繁华的区域，这个价钱也是过得去的。但是其他酒店在同样的价钱，提供更好的服务和设施，这就相形见拙了。总体让我觉得设施管理水平不高，这也导致整洁度不尽人意。房间本身设计就给人的感觉不清爽干净。浴室的设施也给人不卫生的感觉。是平庸的酒店。来到这样响的品牌的酒店，感觉失望。在同类型的酒店中，我按照水准的高低进行了这样的排序：锦江之星》宜家》...》莫泰。在宜家和莫泰之间还有省略号，就是说这里面可以有若干我不知道的，久悦不上台面。我只考虑锦江和宜家，这2品牌做到了品牌保证的效果。补充点评2007年8月7日：空调漏水！严重！跟自来水似的。好在是早上了，我立即把空调关了，然后用kettle接水，装了半壶水。,"As a business economy chain hotel, it is generally available. In such a prosperous area, this price is also available.However, other hotels provide better services and facilities at the same price, which is dwarfed.Overall makes me feel that the level of facility management is not high, which also causes unsatisfactory cleanliness.The design of the room itself is not refreshing and clean.The bathroom facilities also feel unhygienic.It is a mediocre hotel.I felt disappointed when I came to such a loud brand.In the same type of hotels, I made such a sort according to the level of the standard: the star of the Jinjiang ""IKEA"" ... ""Mo Tai.There is also a omission between IKEA and Motai, which means that there can be several things I don't know in it, and Jiu Yue is not on the stage.I only consider Jinjiang and IKEA. These two brands have achieved the effect of brand guarantee.Supplementary comment on August 7, 2007: Air conditioning leaks!serious!Like tap water.Fortunately, it was in the morning. I immediately turned off the air conditioner, and then picked up the water with Kettle and loaded half a pot of water."

0,是华苑产业园区唯一的酒店，虽说有3星，但总体感觉也就比快捷酒店好一点。,"It is the only hotel in Huayuan Industrial Park. Although there are 3 stars, the overall feeling is better than the express hotel."
0,国庆头一天去住，门市价和携程的价一样，豪华房672元还不包早餐。房间设施挺旧得了，感觉很一般。,"The first day of the National Day, the price of the store is the same as the price of Ctrip. The luxury house is 672 yuan.The room facilities are very old and feel average."
0,"这个酒店唯一值得称赞的是销售部的一位女士,但是很抱歉,我忘掉了她的名字.评价:1)性价比绝对不值得,附近的同类酒店很多,性价比都比这家好2)除上面提及的一位销售部的女士外,其它的人员都很差,前台完全是招待所的感觉,而且是国营的那种招待所的印象(入住时是半夜,前台穿着军大衣睡眼朦胧的样子简直象演电影一样的标准)3)这家酒店离火车站十分钟的步行，我打了四个电话都没有找到，最后找到时才发现，这是周围所有酒店里唯一夜间没有彩灯的，黑灯瞎伙的确实没办法找到，接电话指导的人完全没有地理概念．4)入住时，前台说的第一句话是＂没有你的定单＂，第二句是＂肯定没有你的定单＂－－之前只问了我叫什么，就象审犯人．我打电话给携程确认时突然又来了一句＂找到了＂，唉！房间连续改了四次，我在前台已经不知道该怎么办了．一会划掉房号改成另一个，一会儿又改回来．．．．．．5)最最要命的是，完全没有按之前定单中注明的要求安排安静的房间，这与携程之前的短信和电话的说法是完全不符的．6)一大堆投诉，直到第三天离开（如果不是因为事情多，第二天早上就离开了）前才接到销售部那位女士的回应--送了一个果盘，唉！7)早餐不要指望什么，本来就内容单薄，八点半就已经主菜大多没有了，热东西少，服务要求反应永远很慢．唉！不推荐入住．南昌实在有太多选择了．不过关于服务，客观地说，南昌整体的服务意识也确实是不高的，但是这家确实是太差了．宾馆反馈2008年4月14日：尊敬的比哥儿比哥儿：您好！首先感谢您入住锦昌大酒店为我们提出宝贵意见，为此酒店高层管理人员非常重视，并特地召集各相关部门专门开会对您的投诉回复如下：1、锦昌大酒店在南昌市三星级酒店中评价、服务、专业化均较好，性价比我们将会更进一步提升；2、前厅部深夜班次员工的工作状态、着装形象我们将在您的鞭策下严格管理并由我们值班经理全权负责检查，树立一个良好的接待形象；3、为了让更多宾客晚上能顺利地找到酒店，我们将推迟2小时关闭酒店的外墙灯，并针对总机及前厅部门进行酒店详细地理位置的培训；4、对于询问预订工作程序，我们着重培训员工具备首问责任制工作原则，第一时间为顾客解决问题，并要求做到不对顾客讲“没有”“不知道”类词语；5、安静房是指锦昌所有房间，分南北两边，南面是居民住宅区本身具备安静条件，北面是靠马路房间，07年已全面安装隔间窗，您住的8821房是北面已安装了隔音窗房间，如仍未达到您的要求，我们酒店高层管理人员会尽最大能力为您解决；6、营销总经理晏艳春女士在接到前厅客户意见反馈后随之上门拜访，并赠送果盘希望能得到您更多的理解与支持；7、早餐经我们统计每天至少保证有四十五个品种，其中最少有十个为热点，另外所有蒸品全部保证热度，至于餐厅的服务我们将不断完善。我们热忱欢迎您再次入住锦昌大酒店。江西锦昌大酒店2008/04/14","The only praise for this hotel is a lady in the sales department, but I'm sorry, I forgot her name. Evaluation: 1) The price / performance ratio is definitely not worth it. There are many similar hotels nearby.In addition to the ladies of a sales department, the other staff are very poor. The front desk is completely the feeling of the guest house, and it is the impression of the state -owned hospitality.Play the same standards for movies) 3) This hotel is ten minutes away from the railway station. I did not find four calls. When I found it, I found that there was no color lamp in all hotels around the surrounding hotels. Black lightsThe blind guy really couldn't find it, and the person who answered the phone had no geographical concept at all.4) At the time of check -in, the first sentence said at the front desk is ""without your order"", and the second sentence is ""there must be no order of your order"" -The only asked what I called before, just like the criminal.When I called Ctrip to confirm, I suddenly came again ""found"", oh!The room changed four times in a row, and I didn't know what to do on the front desk.After a while, the number of room numbers was changed to another, and then changed back...........5) The most terrible thing is that there is no arrangement of a quiet room according to the requirements indicated in the previous order, which is completely inconsistent with the previous text messages and telephone claims of Ctrip.6) A lot of complaints, until the third day (if it was not because there were many things, the next morning, it would be left) before receiving a response from the lady of the sales department-gave a fruit plate, alas!7) Do not expect something for breakfast. The content was thin. Most of the main cuisines were gone at 8:30.well!Not recommended to stay.There are too many choices in Nanchang.However, regarding services, objectively speaking, Nanchang's overall service awareness is indeed not high, but this one is indeed too bad.Hotel feedback on April 14, 2008: Dear Big Brother Big Brother: Hello!First of all, thank you for staying at the Jinchang Hotel to put forward valuable opinions for us.

0,前台的服务很差，10月1日的值班经理徐经理有意欺诈，将220元一晚的标准间欺骗我成380元的商务房，好在携程地客服打电话给我确认才没有上当。,"The service in the front desk was very poor. Manager Xu, the manager on duty on October 1st, intentionally framed and deceived me a 380 yuan business house of 220 yuan a night. Fortunately, Ctrip's customer service called me to confirm that he was not fooled."
0,超乎寻常之差，怎么评的三星不知道，按说就那设施水平连县级招待所都不如。房间巨窄，洗手间就纯一厕所，连个放物品的台子都没有，地漏巨容易堵，刚洗5分钟就水漫金山。总之，设备过于陈旧，建议各位驴友切勿上当。,"It is beyond the difference. I do n’t know how to comment.The room is huge, and the toilet is pure toilet. Even the table with an item is not available. The floor drain is easy to block. After 5 minutes of washing, the water is long.In short, the equipment is too old, it is recommended that you do not fooled."
0,房间里的设施没有广告中理想！价格也没有网上所说的那样分明清楚~~,The facilities in the room have no ideals in advertising!The price is not as clear as the Internet mentioned on the Internet ~~
0,出于不信邪的原因，入住了该酒店。之前查阅了携程上的点评，最近的点评已经有大半年时间了，一厢情愿的以为酒店设施有所改善。但是，去了只能用三个来形容，差！差！差！一次恐怖的入宿。电梯依旧吓人，房间一股霉味，一个灯是坏的！第二天就换到隔壁的一百假日去了。,"For the reason why he did not believe in evil, he stayed in the hotel.I have previously reviewed the reviews on Ctrip. The recent review has been more than half a year, and I wish the hotel facilities improved.However, you can only describe it with three, bad!Difference!Difference!A horror.The elevator is still scary, the room is moldy, and a light is bad!I went to the next hundred holidays the next day."
0,酒店周围环境及内部设施整体还不错。但服务态度极其不好，简直目中无人。入住时，正在填我的入住单，突然过来几个衣着较光鲜的人，就把我的身份证和信用卡放到一边，帮那几个人处理。完后，又过来两个人，又接着处理这两个人。我等了20分钟后，忍不住问还要不要办，才想起来。退房时，遇到同样情况。我正在退房，看到几外老外过来，就直接插队办理。我实在忍无可忍，就问服务员为什么，竟然回答你很赶时间吗？,"The surrounding environment and internal facilities are not bad.But the service attitude is extremely bad, and there is no one in the eyes.During the check -in, I was filling in my check -in form. Suddenly a few people with glory, put my ID card and credit card aside to help those people handling.After that, two people came over and then handled the two.After I waited for 20 minutes, I couldn't help asking if I had to do it before I remembered it.When checking out, the same situation encountered the same situation.I was checking out. When I saw a few foreigners coming, I cut it directly.I was unbearable, so I asked the waiter why, did you even answer you in a hurry?"
0,"很令人无奈的一间酒店,无论哪个方面,尤其是员工的个人素质,特别是应变能力.试想一下,当夜已很深,你正准备入眠的时候,前台打来电话问,:""可否到您房间再收些押金?""你将作何感想?也许他们似乎有足够的理由.当自己用真诚换来酒店的不是尊重而是怀疑时,我一直在想,这个酒店为什么只是5星,而不是7星.它本来应该得9星的,虽然这个世界上并不存在这样完美的家园.","A very helpless hotel, no matter which aspect, especially the personal qualities of employees, especially the ability of the strain. Imagine that the night is deep. When you are preparing to sleep, you will call at the front desk, ""Can you come to the front desk?What will you receive a deposit in your room? ""What will you feel? Maybe they seem to have enough reasons. When you are in your sincerity, you are not respecting but suspicion, and I have been thinking, why is this hotel just 5 stars, and howeverIt is not a 7 -star. It should have 9 stars, although there is no such perfect home in this world."
0,此酒店涉嫌欺骗：ctrip上显示行政房免费上网，但是实事并非如此，只有去行政酒廊去上网才是免费，房间内上网要收费，每分钟2元，而且如果去行政酒廊上网，前提要你在房间先上网激活帐号才可以。也就是说你最少要花两元才能上网，而且不再房间内，这个不是欺骗是啥。早知如此说啥也不会定在这里，1400多的房费，住那里不比这里好，就是想上网。其他服务实在一般。距离市区较远，出行很不方便。周围设施少，同等价位酒店市里多了去了，下次不会住了，还有早餐实在一般。checkin速度慢，有老外提问题，就放下和我checkin的事情过去搭理人家，这点让人感觉很差。checkout也是拖拉。,"This hotel is suspected of deception: Ctrip shows free Internet access on administrative houses, but this is not the case. It is only free to go to the administrative lounge to go online.You can activate your account online in the room.That is to say, you have to spend at least two yuan to access the Internet, and no longer in the room, this is not deception.I knew that this would not be settled here, more than 1,400 room fees, living there is not better than here, just want to surf the Internet.Other services are really average.Far away from the urban area, it is inconvenient to travel.There are few facilities around, and there are more hotels in the same price. I won't live next time. There is still a normal breakfast.CHECKIN is slow, and when foreigners ask questions, let's put down the matter with me. This makes people feel bad.Checkout is also dragging."
0,大家这段时间不要去住，他们施工吵死人了！并且，房间里的提示上说是8：30才开始施工，结构7：40就开始，找他们解决了一早上，到8：30一直没有停止过！到了8：30他们就更有理了，继续开始施工！,"Don't live during this time, they are noisy for construction!In addition, the prompts in the room said that the construction was only started at 8:30. The structure started at 7:40. After looking for them to solve it all morning, it has never stopped at 8:30!At 8:30, they are even more reasonable and continue to start construction!"
0,"这家酒店怎么可能是五星级的呢?酒店房间小,装修普通,床比起其他五星级酒店小.这些暂且不说.服务员的态度真的是不敢恭维.我住在行政楼层,CHECKIN的时候,前台小姐竟然在接电话聊天,聊吃臭豆腐.1200的房价,预授权只做了1500.然后我晚上去吃饭签单签了400左右.服务员没有提醒,我也没有想到这事.晚上了,我已经准备睡觉了,突然电话打来硬是要我再去前台刷卡,我没办法只能再重新换好衣服拿着信用卡再去前台.酒店硬件方面也就不说什么了,但是服务员的水准确实有待提高,不然配不上这个房价!","How could this hotel be five -star? The hotel room is small and the decoration is ordinary. The bed is smaller than other five -star hotels.When checking, the front desk lady even answered the phone to chat, talked about eating stinky tofu. 1200 house prices, pre -authorized only 1500. Then I went to dinner at night to sign around 400. The waiter did not remind me, and I did not think of this.In the evening, I was ready to sleep. Suddenly, I called and asked me to go to the front desk to swipe the card. I could n’t just change my clothes again and hold the credit card before going to the front desk.The level of the level really needs to be improved, otherwise it will not be worthy of this house price!"
0,酒店位置佳，出入西街比较方便；观景房是观西街的景，晚上虽然较吵但基本不会影响到睡眠；酒店对面就是在携程上预订自行车的九九车行，取车方便。通过携程订房已付费的情况下还需要收款200元的钥匙押金；没有电梯，行李员可以提供提行李到房间的服务；房间比较老，地毯非常脏，斑斑点点很多，有股霉味，洗手间会有下水道气味，刚进门时在床边发现一颗超大的荔枝核，可见清洁时过于匆忙，不是很用心，大床太硬舒适性低；房间内经常会有蚊子游荡，更为恐怖的是第二天结束游玩回到房间，竟然在台灯下看见一张蜘蛛网，可见卫生质量真的是.......不高。总体来说，地理环境还可以，硬件设施太差。早餐品种非常少，没有现烧的东西，加料不太及时，如果要求不高的话，吃饱还是可以的。,"The hotel location is good, and it is more convenient to enter and leave West Street. The viewing room is a view from Guanxi Street. Although it is more noisy at night, it will basically not affect sleep. Opposite the hotel is the nine -nine car bank to book a bicycle on Ctrip.Through Ctrip's reservation, the key deposit of 200 yuan is required to receive the payment; without an elevator, the luggage can provide the service of luggage to the room; the room is old, the carpets are very dirty, there are many spots, there is a moldy flavor, the toilet is the toilet,There will be a smell of the sewer. When I first entered the door, I found a large litchi nucleus at the bed. It can be seen that it is too rushing when cleaning, not very attentive, and the large bed is too hard and comfortable.After the next day, I returned to the room and saw a spider web under the desk lamp. It can be seen that the quality of hygiene is really ... not high.Overall, the geographical environment is okay, and the hardware facilities are too poor.There are very few breakfast varieties. There are no existing burning things. The feeding is not timely. If the requirements are not high, it is okay to eat."
0,地方偏僻，而且部根本是人服的，前天去住的候，空都有，酒店借口，已了，但是一都有，了省，搞的，好。下次一定不入住店了。,"The place is remote, and the ministry is simply served. When I stayed the day before yesterday, there were emptys. The hotel excuses, but all of them, but all of them, province, do it, good.I will not stay in the store next time."
0,入住前的期待还是很高，不过到达后感觉还是比较失望，这个价值和七斗星、如家等不到200元房价的经济型酒店还是有一定的差距，同去的同事的评价也不高，有点后悔没要什么服务，这方面不清楚退房速度还可以,"The expectations before check -in are still very high, but it is still disappointed after arriving. This value of such value hotels with a value of 200 yuan, such as the seven -fighting stars, and a house price of less than 200 yuan. There is still a certain gap.I regret that I don’t want any service, I don’t know this aspect."
0,一般。除了便宜。一个大问题就是浴缸的设计有问题，洗澡的时候溅出的水会顺着浴缸靠墙那边的平面一直流到外面的地上。等洗完之后，浴室里已经是水漫金山了。我费了老大的劲才研究出来的，原来里面的那个平面是倾斜的，水所以就顺流而下了，一直流到外面。还有，饭店没有大堂，和隔壁一个公寓或者说是商务区公用一个小小的区域，被称作大堂。跟燕山差不少。下回去石家庄，不去这家了。也有有点那就是买东西挺方便的。边上就是北国超市和北国商场，还有麦当劳和啃鸡。,"generally.Except for cheap.A big problem is that there is a problem with the design of the bathtub. The water splattered when bathing will flow along the plane of the bathtub against the wall to the outside.After the washing, the bathroom was already water.I spent the energy of the boss. The plane in it was inclined, and the water was flowing down, and it flowed outside.In addition, there is no lobby in the hotel, and an apartment next door or a small area of publicly used the business district, known as the lobby.A lot from Yanshan.Go back to Shijiazhuang and don't go to this house anymore.There is also a bit that it is very convenient to buy things.On the side are the North State Supermarkets and North State Malls, as well as McDonald's and chicken."
0,"这个酒店原来是广州的一个亮点,但昨天入住以后才发现如此的糟糕.几乎每到一处,经历的都是不愉快!!!!1.4.6号入住广州长隆酒店.4月1下的单,定单上专门强调要的是一间望游泳池的家庭4人房,并且信用卡担保.携程的工作人员第2天确认的时候也是CONFIRM了已经和酒店落实了这个要求的.6号到达以后才发现家庭4人房望的是窗外无敌的建筑施工工地.酒店解释说:所有家庭4人房都是望工地的,根本没有望泳池家庭房,上当受骗的感觉由然而生!!!!!2.当下要求换成2间豪华房,在交涉过程中,酒店和携程互相推卸责任,把我当皮球踢,一句道歉的话都没有,对此我非常失望.3.前台年轻男工作人员刷卡预付肥之后竟然忘记了归还我的信用卡,直到我第2次大前台换房间他才发现,居然没有向我道歉.3.最终同意修改定单,将原来的1间家庭4人房(1130元)改为2间豪华间(810/间).但当我提出其中一间要大床房时,那男员工头也不抬地拒绝说:没，没有大床房了!要我夫妻两入双床房.这时候我实在忍不住了,说,你查都没查过,怎么知道没有了呢,就不能从顾客角度与人方便?在旁边的另外一个员工扬小姐这才查了一下,最后给了一间大床房.刚才说没有了,突然又有了,真奇怪.杨小姐的解释是说:我们的顾客大多是香港人,他们早就付了款,所以房间给他们留着.我愤怒.我的房间也是信用卡担保了,就算今天我不来,房费也是要付的,香港人难道比大陆人金贵?什么年代的脑筋啊.强烈鄙视!!4.扬小姐提出给房间送水果表示歉意,.并承诺在我从乐园回房之前把我的行李从家庭房转去豪华房.但后来,我带儿子回酒店时到前台补多一个身份证才发现我的行李仍未送过去房间.5,本月6-13号入住长隆酒店,每房送欢乐世界,大马戏,动物园门票2张(任选),我们拿到门票要进欢乐世界的时候,那工作人员居然说不认识这票,说酒店方面没有通知过,把我们3大一小扣住,烈日之下,等待他们之间的交涉,沟通,只有摇头的份.6.酒店家具简陋,陈旧,服务人员没有服务意识.每有一个人脸上露出过真诚待客的笑容.我们询问自助餐的价格,西餐厅门口的小姐顾着自己聊天,让我自己看玻璃门上的信息.7.下午在酒店室外游泳池游泳,算是仅有的一点享受了.除了我和另外一个男外宾就没别人了.但我走时候把游泳衣遗漏在了更衣室.到第2天退房之后我才发现,在此之间酒店都没有人打电话到房间来询问我是否有不见东西.(游泳的时候有登记房号,他们可以查到).我是携程的金牌贵宾,入住酒店几乎都是5星,相比之下,我对这间酒店真是失望透了,坚决不会再去.告诉大家我的感受,去之前要有心理准备.","This hotel was originally a highlight of Guangzhou, but I found out so badly after staying yesterday. Almost every time I arrived, I experienced unpleasant experience !!!! 1.4.6 stay at the Changlong Hotel in Guangzhou.The order is specifically emphasized on the order of a family of 4 people looking at the swimming pool, and the credit card guarantee. Ctrip's staff was confirmed on the second day of confirmation.The family of 4 people looked at the invincible building construction site outside the window. The hotel explained that 4 people's rooms were in the construction site. There was no family room for the swimming pool.At present, it is required to be replaced with 2 luxury rooms. During the negotiation process, the hotel and Ctrip shirk each other and kick me as a ball. There is no apology. I am very disappointed. 3.I forgot to return my credit card, and it was not until my second large front desk changed the room. He found out that he did not apologize to me .3. Finally, I agreed to modify the order and changed the original 4 -person house (1130 yuan) to 2 to 2.The luxury room (810/room). But when I proposed that one of them had a large bed, the male employee also refused to say: No, there is no big bed room! I want my husband and wife to enter the double bed room.At this time, I couldn't help it anymore. I said, you haven't checked it. How can you know that if you have gone, you can't be convenient and convenient from the perspective of the customer? Only another employee Yang next to the side was checked. Finally, I gave it.A big bed room. I just said it was gone, and suddenly there was again, it was strange. Ms. Yang's explanation was: Most of our customers were Hong Kong people, they paid for a long time, so the room kept them. I was angry. I was angry.My room is also guaranteed by a credit card. Even if I do n’t come today, the house fee is to pay. Is it more expensive than the mainlanders? What age is the brain. Strong contempt !! 4. Ms. Yang proposed to send a fruit to the room to express the fruit to indicate that the fruit indicates that the room shows the fruit.Sorry, and promised to transfer my luggage from the family room to the luxurious room before I returned to the room from the park. But then, when I took my son back to the hotel, I went to the front desk to make an additional ID card..5, stayed at the Chimelong Hotel on 6-13 this month, and sent 2 tickets for each room, two tickets, zoo tickets (optional). When we got the tickets to enter the happy world, the staff actually said that he did not know.This vote said that the hotel has not been notified, holding us 3 big and one small small, under the scorching sun, waiting for the negotiations and communication between them, only shaking the head .6. The hotel furniture was simple, old, and the service staff did not have a sense of service awareness.Everyone has a sincere smile on the face of a person. We asked the price of the buffet, and the lady at the door of the western restaurant looked at the information on the glass door.I enjoyed only a little bit. Except for me and another male guest, there were no one else. But when I left, I missed the swimsuit in the locker room. After I retired on the second day, I found that there was no hotel between the hotels.People call to the room to ask if I have any disappearances. (When swimmingBook number, they can find it). I am Ctrip's gold medal VIP, and almost 5 stars in the hotel. In contrast, I am really disappointed with this hotel, and I will not go again. Tell you myFeel, be mentally prepared before you go."

0,承德历史和自然风景很美，但饭店服务方面、、不敢恭维住宿：1、房间标间设施简陋但还算干净，可是房间总是有一股刺鼻的家具气味；另外房间木门变形，每次关门总要使劲儿才能关上，不仅声音巨大扰民，而且不容易上锁。2、家具明显老化，很多家具都掉漆了3、环境非常安静，适合住宿，没有杂七杂八的骚扰，能睡个好觉餐饮：在北京也吃过几家素斋，心想这里应该也不错吧！！嘿嘿、、、首先菜单上素斋就2页，菜品单调，而且和荤菜和在一起，让人失望。不过既然来了，那怎么也点上几个素斋尝尝，顺便叫了当地产的15元1瓶的精品啤酒，没想到菜上来后、、、其中一道素斋“糖醋里脊”，厨师糖搁多了变苦了，我和媳妇尝了没法吃，就希望退了或换菜。没想到麻烦来了：先是服务员把菜撤回后厨又原样端回说这菜就这味儿；没辙叫领班商量，过一会儿，又一服务员冷冰冰的过来，问我们找领班什么事？我只好又解释一遍；等啊等，千呼万唤，领班终于出现了，问有什么问题，我又重复一遍。领班大人表情严肃地尝了一口，斩钉截铁的断言：“菜没问题，我们这就是这个味道！！！”无言，我只有乖乖的结帐，拉着生了一肚子气的媳妇回房间。这就是4星级酒店的服务，我只能在心中默念：“顾客是上帝，下次我决不到这住了。”,"Chengde history and natural scenery are beautiful, but in terms of hotel services, dare not compliment accommodation: 1. The room standard and room facilities are simple but clean, but the room always has a pungent furniture smell;Closing the door must always be able to close it. Not only does it disturb the people, but it is not easy to lock.2. The furniture is obviously aging. Many furniture has been painted. 3. The environment is very quiet and suitable for accommodation. There is no mixed harassment. I can sleep well.IntersectionIntersectionHey ,,,, the first menu is 2 pages on the menu, the dishes are monotonous, and with amaranth, it is disappointing.But since it comes, how can I also order a few Suzhai to try it, and by the way, I called the local real estate 15 yuan and 1 bottle of boutique beer. I did not expect that after the dishes came up, one of them was ""sweet and sour ridge"", and the chefAfter the sugar was too much, it became bitter. My daughter -in -law and I couldn't eat it, so I hope to retreat or change the vegetables.I didn't expect the trouble: First, the waiter withdrew the food and said the dish that the dish was the same; there was no such thing as a leader to discuss. After a while, another waiter came over Lengbing and asked us what was going on to find a leader?I had to explain it again; wait, wait, there are thousands of calls, and the foreman finally appeared. If you ask what questions, I repeat it again.The leader of the foreman took a sip of his expression seriously, and the assertion of the sip of the iron interception: ""The dish is fine, we are the taste !!!"" Speechless, I only had a obedient checkout and pulled a daughter -in -law who had a stomachache back to the room.This is the service of a 4 -star hotel. I can only meditate in my heart: ""Customers are God, I will never stay here next time."""
0,"入住当晚,因火车到达得较晚。到酒店前门一看，感觉就象烂尾楼，黑灯瞎火的，还以为出租车拉错地方了。后面到总台一问说是大堂搞装修。上到房间一看，房间内的设置就更差了。地毯上到处是补丁，一股子霉味，我住的还是豪华标双。不晓得普标哪得成什么样？两百多人民币还不如现如今的经济型酒店，太失望了，货不对板(跟图片上比）。宾馆反馈2008年5月30日：谢谢您的宝贵意见!实在对不起,我代表酒店向您致以诚挚的歉意!您提的这几个问题酒店现在已经全部解决,欢迎您下次入住!","On the night of staying, the train arrived late.When I saw it at the front door of the hotel, I felt like a rotten tail building. The black light was blind, and I thought the taxi was pulling the wrong place.Later, when I went to the main station, I asked the lobby for decoration.When you go to the room, the settings in the room are even worse.There are patch everywhere on the carpet, a moldy smell, and I still live in a luxurious bidding double.I do n’t know what Pubiao is like?More than 200 yuan is not as disappointing as today's economy hotels.Hotel feedback on May 30, 2008: Thank you for your valuable opinions!

0,男友是老外第一次来上海所以选择住的离外滩近的酒店，25号入住一切OK，宾馆周围环境不怎么样就是离外滩近点总的来说还是可以接受。26号退房时前台小姐说我们用了房间的避孕套要收10块钱，但是我确实没有用，这种东西我们当然会自备，前台说你没用那就是老外拿了，当时退房的人很多我真的不好意思为了这个套的问题和前台争论，男友也说没有拿，我想想算了也就10块钱就没有再说了，但是如果这个酒店对每个客人都这样一间10块那一天可以多挣多少钱？由于行李很多我们把东西寄存在宾馆27号又回来住了，我那天有事就男友一个人住宾馆，第二天我来接男友，男友说昨天晚上有小姐打电话来说要不要按摩他说了不要过了一会一个老女人带了2个年轻的小姐来敲房门说你女朋友今晚不在要不要小姐来帮你按摩只要200块，我很震惊难道宾馆的监控就是起这个作用的嘛？难得宾馆到处都有安排眼线来监视客人的嘛？男友说了不要他们就是不走后来男友说你们再不走我就报警了她们才走的。晚上我和男友出来用餐我们房间旁边是康乐中心，一个瘦瘦的男的正好看到我和男友从房间出来，他居然过来问我，态度语气非常差问你是谁？我说我是他女朋友他还问老外她是你女朋友嘛？关他什么事情他凭什么来问我，男友问WHATHAPPEN?后来男友说算了我们来度假的不要为这种事情影响心情。可我实在太气就打了电话到大堂经理那投诉，要那男的向我道歉，大堂经理姓陆在电话里说了对不起说康乐中心按摩是承包给别人的。难得承包给别人就可以不用管理让他们为所作为了嘛？第二天没有小姐来敲门了但也没有人来当面道歉。总之住在这个酒店是我们整个假期的瑕疵，以后我绝对不会再来这个酒店住了。宾馆反馈2008年1月4日：首先，非常感谢客人入住我们酒店。其次，酒店想对客人提出的主要问题作以下说明：文中所提到的老女人和两个年轻小姐并非我酒店员工，也和我酒店无任何瓜葛。此三位女士确实有拜访过房间，拜访时是以房间客人朋友的身份进入我们酒店大堂的，保安部员工对三位女士也按照正常访客来访规程进行过登记，并且我酒店监控系统有对其进行监控。为了保护来访客人的隐私，酒店在此不予透露其姓名。酒店本着为客人提供最优质、最舒适的服务作为宗旨，也非常愿意接受客人的意见、建议甚至批评，以使我们的服务做到更好。,"My boyfriend is the first time that foreigners came to Shanghai so they chose to stay near the hotel. They stayed at all OK on the 25th. The environment around the hotel was not very good.When checking out on the 26th, Miss front desk said that we need to collect 10 yuan for the condoms in the room, but I really use it. Of course, we will bring themselves.Many people, I am really embarrassed to argue with the front desk for this problem, my boyfriend also said that he did n’t get it.How much can I make more on that day?Since we have a lot of luggage, we send things on the 27th of the hotel to live again. I had something to live in the hotel alone that day. I came to pick up my boyfriend the next day. My boyfriend said that a lady called last night to say whether to massage him.Don't pass a while, an old woman brought two young ladies to knock on the door and said that your girlfriend is not in the lady tonight to help you massage as long as 200 yuan. I am shocked.IntersectionThere are rare hotels everywhere to monitor guests?The boyfriend said, don't want them to go without walking, and the boyfriend said that if you don't leave, I will call them before they leave.In the evening, my boyfriend and I came out to dine. We were next to our room. A thin man just saw me and my boyfriend come out of the room. He actually came over and asked me.I said that I am his girlfriend. He still asked the foreigner as your girlfriend?Why did he ask me what he was? Boyfriend asked whathappen? Later, my boyfriend said that we should not affect our mood for this kind of thing.But I was so angry that I called to the lobby manager's complaint, asking the man to apologize to me. The lobby manager Lu was on the phone and said sorry for the Kangle Center massage to be contracted to others.Can it be rare to contract to others without managing them to do what they do?The next day, no lady came to knock on the door but no one came to apologize in person.In short, living in this hotel is the flaws of our entire holiday, and I will never come to this hotel to stay in this hotel in the future.Hotel feedback on January 4, 2008: First of all, thank you customers for staying in our hotel.Secondly, the hotel wants to make the main questions raised by the guests. The following description: The old women and two young ladies mentioned in the article are not our hotel employees, and they have no feats with our hotel.These three ladies have indeed visited the room.

0,不知道携程怎么跟酒店协商的，明明连住两晚248，酒店偏要收我们同事275！害的我打电弧给携程和酒店协调这个事，酒店说销售部没上班，晕，销售部没上班你就别开店了！！虽然后来在携程的努力下酒店做出了补偿性的方案，但毕竟这样的遭遇确实让人很不舒服。其实我们一般去重庆都是住这里，也没有特别不如意的地方。但是这样看上去酒店方小小的失误，确给消费者非常不舒服的感觉，我想这事对富丽来讲不是偶然，期望富丽持续改进。,"I do n’t know how to negotiate with the hotel. It obviously lives 248 nights and 248. The hotel has to accept our colleagues 275!I harmed the arc to coordinate this matter to Ctrip and the hotel. The hotel said that the sales department did not go to work, dizzy, and the sales department did not open the store if you did n’t go to work!IntersectionAlthough the hotel made a compensation plan under the efforts of Ctrip, after all, such encounters were really uncomfortable.In fact, we usually live here in Chongqing, and there are no particularly unsatisfactory places.However, it seems that the small mistake of the hotel side is indeed very uncomfortable to consumers. I think it is not accidental to Fuli, and I hope that Fury will continue to improve."
0,很明显携程的客人没有受到礼遇。用了8年的携程，第一次怀疑是否有必要继续用携程。2星期前预订的是大床豪华客房要求面对泳池，两大一小，下午3点托人办手续入住居然给了一个1.5米床的单间，至11点回酒店时发现不对经交涉才换了一间边远地带对着住宅的两张单床豪客，理由是有会议没房了；晚上11点拖着行李箱和一只伤脚还带着闹着要睡觉的小孩在酒店奔来奔去绝对令人愤怒。致电要求大堂副理上门解释没有下文，向携程投诉的结果是酒店不会道歉不会免费升级不会减免房费但可以免费送个果盘……靠！当咱是讨饭的呵！这种服务态度不会再来了！当然酒店可能一样不在乎你携程的客人来不来。,"Obviously, Ctrip's guests are not courteous.After 8 years of Ctrip, for the first time, I doubted whether it was necessary to continue to use Ctrip.2 weeks ago, the large -bed luxury room required to face the swimming pool. Two large and one small. At 3 pm, the trustees handled the procedures and gave a single room with a 1.5 -meter bed. When I returned to the hotel at 11 o'clockThere were two single -bed guests facing the house in a remote area. The reason was that there were no rooms in the meeting; dragging the suitcase at 11 pm, and a child who was going to sleep with a naked child.It's absolutely angry.The call of the deputy manager of the lobby has not been explained.

0,酒店太偏已在郊外，出来打车不太方便，住宿客人太少，感觉上冷冷清清的，可是预定的时候还需要提供信用卡担保，说是房间紧张，其实可能是怕客人跑掉吧。服务、设施都太一般。补充点评2007年11月13日：不过贵阳整个就是一个脏乱差的典型，东东还贵得吓死人，去贵阳的话就不要抱什么美好的愿望了！,"The hotel is too far from the suburbs. It is not convenient to get out of a taxi. There are too few guests in accommodation. It feels cold and deserted, but when you are booked, you need to provide a credit card guarantee.

0,位于友谊路金融街，找不到吃饭的地方。酒店刚刚装修好，有点气味，我能忍受，同事不行。酒店、楼下餐厅、酒吧、日式料理都是科技大厦单独承包出去的。入住的时候还是第一个月试营业，宽带很不稳定，打电话报修居然以正处试营业期来搪塞。没好就不要让客人住嘛，强烈鄙视这一点。,"Located in Youyi Road Financial Street, you can't find a place to eat.The hotel has just been renovated, a bit of smell, I can bear it, my colleagues can not work.Hotels, downstairs restaurants, bars, and Japanese cuisine are all contracted separately from the Science and Technology Building.At the time of check -in, the first month of trial business was still unstable, and the call to report to the repair was actually confused in the trial business period.Don't let the guests live without good, strongly despise this."
0,太差的酒店，里面的很多东西都发黄了，隔壁都是出租给别人办公的。服务态度也不好，找他们件事，他居然说“我说不过他，叫上面跟他说。”这是他们服务员的原话。态度极其的不好，话语生硬，好象是求他施舍房子给我住一样。请携程不要与这种低级的酒店签协议，我是很相信你们的，所以觉得每次都会很可靠，但这次是极度的失望。,"The poor hotel, a lot of things inside are yellow, and are rented to others next door.The service attitude is not good. Finding them, he actually said, ""I can't say him, and tell him to tell him."" This is the original words of their waiters.The attitude is extremely bad, and the words are stiff, as if asking him to give up the house for me.Ctrip should not sign an agreement with this low -level hotel.

0,作为一家4星级酒店，完全达不到要求。房间设施陈旧而简陋，服务态度象国营企业，皮笑肉不笑的让人心寒。餐厅的菜难吃而且贵。最受不了的是上网收费，而且速度不快。携程的房价也高的吓人。下次绝对不会再住这个酒店了,"As a 4 -star hotel, it is not required at all.The room facilities are old and humble, and the service attitude is like state -owned enterprises.The restaurant's dishes are difficult and expensive.The most unbearable is online charges, and the speed is not fast.Ctrip's house prices are also scary.I will never stay in this hotel next time"
0,"用餐一般，价格比一般稍贵，签单付账时千万注意，因为它没有明细，只会写""零点餐""然后一个总金额""如""零点餐－－1032.00"").如果是集团划账请千万注意多收费现象,而且周期很长,可能会花一个月时间在对账上.(请分清是销售在和您对账而不是财务).","The meal is average, and the price is slightly more expensive than the average.

0,"这家酒店充其量只能算是三星,无论从硬件还是软件方面来说都达不到五星的标准.我9月14日网上预定了三个房19日入住,结果到了前台被告知没有收到预定单,经过和携程联系后等了足足半小时才入住,这其间没有得到前台一句道歉的话,而且还把我们几个房间分到不同的楼层,说是没有同一楼层的房了;可事实不是这样的,后边我们同行的还有几个朋友入住都分到我这一楼层,证明不是没有房间而是前台有意刁难.到前台与之理论一番之后才把我们几个房安排到一起,真是让人生气,以后再也不会入住这酒店了.另外在前台直接办入住是488,携程的价格是588.","This hotel can only be regarded as Samsung at best, and the standard of five stars in terms of hardware and software.After contacting Ctrip for half an hour before staying, I did not get a sentence of an apology at the front desk, and I also divided a few of our rooms to different floors, saying that there is no room on the same floor;In the back, several friends who were walking together were divided into me on this floor, which proved that it was not without a room but the front desk intended to make difficulties. After the theory of the front desk was the theory, we arranged a few rooms togetherPeople are angry, and I will never stay in this hotel in the future. In addition, it is 488 directly at the front desk, and the price of Ctrip is 588."
0,第一次入住，感觉很差。宾馆服务人员的态度不好，强烈的不满！怎么评上五星的？退房时头一次碰到要在两个柜台间来回的折腾才能退房的酒店！这是我第一次入住，也将是最后一次！拜拜了！,"It felt bad for the first time.The attitude of hotel service staff is not good, strong dissatisfaction!How to comment on five stars?At the first time I check out, I encountered a hotel that had to go back and forth between the two counters to check out!This is the first time I stay in, and it will be the last time!Goodbye!"
0,实在看不懂的房价，房间较干净，但是象是临时房一样，几乎没有隔音，昆山的酒店价格太离谱了！,"The house prices that really do n’t understand, the room is relatively clean, but like a temporary house, there is almost no sound insulation, the hotel prices in Kunshan are too outrageous!"
0,优点：位置佳，房间大，网速快缺点：不太清洁(卫生间及餐厅地上均发现小强)，整理房间方面有些疏忽(沐浴液用光没补充、热水壶内的水已有一段时间无清理)，外面比较嘈杂但房间隔音差，离开办生续时用了20分钟。,"Advantages: good location, large room, fast internet speed disadvantage: not very clean (Xiaoqiang found on both bathrooms and restaurants), there are some negligence in the finishing room (the bath liquid is not supplemented by light, and the water in the hot kettle has been cleaned for a while for a while.), It is relatively noisy outside, but the room sounds poorly. It took 20 minutes to leave for a lifetime."
0,上个月住了一天。前台订房时说好了是大床房，198元，2321号房，进去发现是双人标间，回前台，改到3101号房，是大床房，前台人员亲手填了换房单，注明所换房间和房价，为188元，并要我签了字，但并未给我这个单子。第二天结帐要208元，我说不是换房单把价钱写得很清楚了吗，他们矢口否认，我要他们拿出叫我签了字的换房单，他们推说没有了。而最早的入住单子（2321号房）上的房价的198元被划掉改成了208元。他们的骗人态度到是练得很好，无论我怎么着急他们也是态度平和的耍赖。我要敢时间，只好交钱走人。只能说，这家店为了区区20元真是手段高明。至于房间质量，很一般，只是地理位置在重庆可能算是不错的，但绝对不推荐入住，如果一定要住，请多加小心，保留好一切证据，尤其是要签字的东西，他们是不会为你保存的，自己要多留心。,"I lived a day last month.When the front desk is reservation, it is said that it is a large bed room, 198 yuan, room 2321, and found that it is a double standard room, go back to the front desk, and change to room 3101. It is a large bed room.The room and house prices were 188 yuan, and I asked me to sign, but I did not give me this list.The next day's checkout was 208 yuan. I said that the price of the room was not written clearly. They denied that I wanted them to take out the room for me to sign the room. They said that it was gone.The earliest house price on the earliest checklist (Room 2321) was divided into 208 yuan.Their deceiving attitude is well practiced, and no matter how anxious I am, they are also a peaceful attitude.I have to dare to take time, so I have to pay for it.It can only be said that this shop is really clever for 20 yuan.As for the quality of the room, it is very average, but the geographical location may be good in Chongqing, but it is absolutely not recommended to stay. If you must live, please be careful and keep all evidence, especially what you want to sign.Stay, pay more attention."
0,该酒店位置好，离解放碑3分钟路程，房间宽敞。早餐可以，甜点很好吃。但大堂太小，电梯少，客人多，且和写字楼混用，很不方便。从房间装修看的确是个商务酒店，但携程上却说是四星级标准，实际上很难达到四星级水平。该酒店最大问题是没有给客人准备免费袋装茶，茶杯旁边有一小桶茶叶，很容易误认为是免费的，谁知结账时要了我11块钱。服务员的解释是如果要免费袋装茶宾馆可以另行提供，牵强的很。,"The hotel is located in a good location, and the room is spacious.Breakfast is fine, and the dessert is delicious.But the lobby is too small, there are few elevators, more guests, and mixed with office buildings, it is inconvenient.From the room decoration, it is indeed a business hotel, but Ctrip is said to be a four -star standard, which is actually difficult to meet the four -star level.The biggest problem of the hotel is that there are no free bags for guests for guests. There is a small bucket of tea next to the tea cup. It is easy to mistakenly think that it is free. Who knows that I asked me 11 yuan at the checkout.The waiter's explanation is that if you want to carry a free pocket, the tea hotel can be provided separately, which is far -fetched."

0,特价房相当的吵。临近高价桥，晚上吵死拉。不过在背面的房间倒还不错，价格也很有吸引力。就是房间很旧！服务员态度一般，而且还很忙，入住和退房都等了很久，差不多10-30分钟才能搞定。,"Special rooms are quite noisy.Near the high -priced bridge, noisy at night.However, the room on the back is still good, and the price is very attractive.The room is very old!The waiter's attitude is average, and he is still very busy.

0,6日晚上9点左右入住，同时在前台办理入住的还有另外两对。结果都被告知要出示结婚证，如果没有结婚证那么两个人的身份证上的地址必须相同，如果没有证身份证地址也不相同，就无法办理两个人入住一间房。当场六个人全部傻眼。无论怎么说出门都没有带结婚证的习惯而且订房的时候从来也没有要求出示结婚证，前台的那个服务员就是不松口。后来是有一位GG绕了好几圈找了个当地的熟人，然后给那个服务员打了个电话，保证半夜警察如果来查房的时候一切责任自负后，才算开始给我们办理。折腾到10点才住进4楼最角落的海景大床房，结果厕所的抽水马桶是坏的，服务员来弄了半天也没弄好，说要叫维修人员，吓得我们连忙说算了算了，这大晚上又坐了长途车，谁有精力再去对付维修人员啊。安置好，下楼，大堂里有潮汐时刻表，还挺管用。绕到旁边的餐厅的那一头下到沙滩。夜里海边风大，海水也冰冷，穿了夹克犹觉得冷嗖嗖的，本来还想明天下游泳的念头也被风吹散了。在旁边假日酒店(HolidayInn)的后门，发现一家还在营业的酒店，厨师和店里的人坐在门口打麻将。我们去，点了辣炒花蛤（15/斤）、清蒸海螺（25/斤，正好6个）、皮皮虾（也叫琵琶虾，15/斤）、花生米、皮蛋，后来还加了一个葱爆海参，一瓶青岛纯生，吃的那叫一个美味，最后才123块，真是大顺！强烈推荐这家酒店，因为事实证明，这是我们此行中吃的最价廉物美的海鲜，而且还是在5星级的假日酒店后门的沙滩上！回来一夜无话，除了阳台上的门总是关不紧，我们不得不拿单人椅顶住阳台门防止隔壁的旅伴梦游翻墙而过，呵呵。但是早上醒来后发现门还是开着。。。。幸亏7点就被外面光光光的扔钢筋的噪音吵醒了。入住的时候被告知酒店正在装修，可能会有影响。当时以为只是内部的装修，而且不会在客人休息的清晨进行。没想到装修是指在我们的阳台紧外面搭建一个建筑！而且工人们才不管你是不是在睡觉，天亮就开始干活了。于是很郁闷地起来，一边安慰自己说就当叫醒服务吧。不管怎么样，从阳台看出去的海，还可以，而且侧头就可以和住你隔壁的旅友轻声细语，呵呵。夜晚安静的时候可以听见海浪的哗哗声，和隔壁的电视机声。从服务、档次、设施、水平来说，这个酒店不值得ctrip上面的365/晚的价格。,"Check in around 9 pm on the 6th, and at the same time, there are two other pairs of check -in at the front desk.As a result, they were informed that they would show the marriage certificate.

0,1，服务没有任何亲切感，生硬、机械。我们一大家人五口，其中一位大人和一位孩子没有带身份证，为此我们吵了40分钟才入住。打电话到派出所，派出所说没有证件就不能住。我们争辩说开了3个多小时车到地方，不让住有点说不过去，警察说这是规定。我们说希望你们警察帮忙，和北京核实一下身份，被生硬拒绝。最后酒店的一个服务生看见我们两个70岁以上的老人累得不行了，才办理入住，已是晚上11点半了。试问:拿着3个身份证开不了房，这承德还能去吗？2，房间不知为何评为携成4星。被子有烟味。设施陈旧。隔音不好。早餐水平比如家的十元的还差。服务员根本不够用，我自己收拾了一桌子，然后坐下吃饭。退房在没有人排队的情况下，用了20分钟，这样的酒店我可使用了610元/房。3，在携成提供的承德酒店列表中，这家酒店可能是最贵的，我本以为找一个好一点的酒店让父母住得高兴一点，看来是适得其反。希望携成在签酒店时还要多做考察，为携程的会员多作考虑。,"1.

0,入住手续办理快速。入住时告知我所预定的豪华房没有房间，免费升级到公寓房。这里首先疑问一下，为什么入住前1天预定时携程系统显示房间状况是良好，第二天中午11点多入住时已经没有房间？是酒店的问题还是携程的问题？第二，我在前台的房间价目表上，并没有看见“公寓房”的牌价，于是很疑问的咨询前台，公寓房时什么性质的房间？回答是平时不对外的房间。没有办法只能入住公寓房，进房间一看，超级大，其实就是二房一厅，两个房间都有床，但是看看里面的设施物品，简直昏倒，最过分的是床单上面还有破洞，床铺铺设的根本不平整，连三星级的酒店都比不上。卫生间的地上很脏，及其不舒服。环视房间，我找不到一本服务手册，于是酒店电话说明、闭路电视选台介绍等等什么都不清楚。房间没有总控开关，没有门铃的免打扰、没有浴袍、没有针线包。。。连3星级酒店房间应该必备的物品，这里都没有！！！很气愤，酒店式公寓是没有星级评定的，我预定的是5星级酒店，却给我一个没有星级没有任何服务的公寓房，其实一个人住一个晚上，需要这样大的两室一厅的房间吗？关键是种种不便，我无法接受。既然是升级，应该升级为酒店有星级定义的房间！因为没有看见该酒店5星级的房间，因此只能打这样的分数，希望酒店以此为戒，也希望携程反思，为什么会出现这样的情况！,"Check in quickly.During the check -in, I told me that there were no rooms I had to have a luxury room, and it was upgraded to the apartment for free.First of all, why is the Ctrip system showing that the room condition is in good time 1 day before staying in the day before staying. There is no room when staying at 11 o'clock the next day?Is it a hotel problem or a Ctrip problem?Second, I did not see the price of the ""apartment"" on the room price list in the front desk, so I doubted the consultation front desk, what kind of room in the apartment?The answer is a room that is not outside.There is no way to stay in the apartment.

0,五一小长假期间去到碧海蓝天，简直是太失望了。以前南戴河以及碧海蓝天的总体印象虽然谈不上很好，但起码干净整洁，再加上有帆板可玩，去得也都是年轻人，印象一直还都不错。这次特意动员几个朋友前往，没想到首先南戴河全面修路，出入都很不方便；其次，南戴河整体环境弄得很脏，满处都是土；再次，碧海蓝天里面不仅没有任何变化，而且比外面环境还脏。房间价格不低，说是海景房，但门口只有工地和水沟，房间中的卫生也非常不好，自来水都是黄色的。建议协程应该多几家一纬路旁边那些度假宾馆。,"It was too disappointed to go to the blue sea and blue sky during the May Day holiday.Although the overall impression of Nan Daihe and the blue sky and the blue sky could not be talked about, at least it was clean and tidy.

0,住过如此之多的如家酒店，这一家是最差的，服务很差，地段也很差，硬件设施简直就像一个县的招待所。的士司机都找不到那个地方，打电话到总台去问，一直无人接听，最后兜了几次圈子在一个小巷子里发现了，到总台问他们为什么不接电话，居然回答说忙得没时间。订的商务大床房，到房间了发现在一楼，窗户外面到处都是停车的，吵得没办法睡觉，还没房间可以换，郁闷。。。以后再也不会去住了。补充点评2007年12月21日：今天接到这家酒店总经理助理打来的电话，对之前的一些事情表示抱歉，并解释了一些原因，感觉态度还是很不错的。希望能以后有所改进，更好的服务所有客人，特别是携程的客人。：）,"I have lived so many hotels. This family is the worst, the service is poor, the location is poor, and the hardware facilities are like a county's hospitality.The taxi drivers could not find that place. I called the head station and asked, and no one answered. Finally, I found a few times and found it in an alley. The main station asked why they did not answer the phone.There is no time to be busy.The large -scale business bed room was found on the first floor. There were parking everywhere outside the window. There was no way to sleep. There was no room to change.EssenceEssenceI will never live again in the future.Supplementary comment on December 21, 2007: I received a call from the assistant general manager of this hotel today. I apologized for some of the previous things and explained some reasons. I feel that the attitude is still very good.I hope to improve in the future and better serve all guests, especially Ctrip's guests.: :)"
0,我是冬至这天入住的，到了酒店就浑身不舒服。酒店有2个门，感觉很怪异，电梯里的灯是暗暗的，我住商务房，一进去就感觉有寒意，怎么看怎么不舒服，后来就换房了。和我一起的有6个人，其中4个和我一样感觉很怪异，后来我们都不敢单独睡，要了双人房睡。客房的设施也是给人很压抑的感觉，电视机柜象个大箱子，仿佛随时有人从里面走出来。柜子和床头各有2个大大的黑色圆球，好像眼睛盯着你。一个同事说，她房间的灯罩居然是黑色的，灯光一直很暗。,"I stayed in the winter solstice, and I was uncomfortable when I arrived at the hotel.There are two doors in the hotel, which feels weird. The lights in the elevator are secretly. I live in a business house. I feel chills when I enter.There were 6 people with me, 4 of which felt weird as me. Later, we did not dare to sleep alone and asked for a double room to sleep.The facilities of the rooms are also very depressed. The TV cabinet looks like a large box, as if someone comes out of it at any time.There are two large black balls on the cabinet and bedside, as if they are staring at you.A colleague said that the lampshade in her room was actually black, and the lights were always dark."
0,可以坐地铁8号线，在曲阜路下车出地铁就到了。西藏北路路口出。到对面就能找到国庆路。不过这个酒店的毛巾，浴巾相当的旧，而且还是黄色的那种，我都没有用过。还好只是住了一天。比较起来对面的晋元大酒店在这方面做的就好多了，旧是旧了点但是毛巾比较好，起码可以用。不过这个地方相对来说很安静。,"You can take Metro Line 8 and get off the subway on Qufu Road.Out of the north road of Tibet.You can find the National Day Road to the opposite side.However, the towels of this hotel are quite old, and it is still yellow. I have never used it.Fortunately, I just lived for a day.In comparison, the Jinyuan Hotel opposite is much better in this area. It is older but the towel is better. At least it can be used.But this place is relatively quiet."
0,10月去的。感觉不是很好。房间和如家的差不多，但感觉差的好大。最让人受不了的是窗户离别人家的阳台那个近啊。都能看见别人家的里面了！！半夜楼道里还有人在吵闹，服务员应该制止一下啦。还有那个中央空调，开了等于没开。洗好澡后还是热的出了身汗。退房的速度也不快！！,"Go in October.It doesn't feel good.The room is similar to the family, but it feels bad.The most unbearable is the window of the window from the balcony of others.You can see the inside of someone else's house!IntersectionThere are still people in the corridor in the middle of the night, and the waiter should stop it.There is also the central air conditioner, which is not on.After taking a shower, it was sweaty.The speed of checking out is not fast!Intersection"
0,"有可能是世界上最差的星级酒店，电视都没有，床头柜只配一个，如厕需经走廊......一句话,烂尾楼改装酒店,又不肯花钱,连民工出租屋都不如.","It may be the worst star hotel in the world. There is no TV. The bedside table is only equipped. The toilet needs to pass through the corridor ... In a word, the rotten tail building is modified in the hotel, and it is not willing to spend money.The house is not as good."
0,房间很小，与行政间的名字不符。另外这家酒店的按摩可千万不能叫，超级黑！结帐时居然会有打手上来，请大家注意！决不会再入住此酒店。,"The room is small, which is not in line with the name of administrative.In addition, the massage of this hotel must not be called, super black!There will be a fight at the checkout, please pay attention!Will never stay in this hotel again."

0,"订了大床房,进了放发现是双人房,看看床还算大,就懒的交涉换房了.浴室冷水档经常出热水,差点烫坏,卫生纸少的可怜,马马乎乎也就过去了.总台服务员没穿制服,服务很一般,和挂牌三星比实在是差远了.280的房价很不值.唯一感到欣慰的是大门保安指挥停车很积极,很热情,很到位.下回来不会住这儿了.","After ordering the big bed room, I found that it was a double room, and the bed was quite large, so I was lazy to negotiate and changed the room. The cold water stalls in the bathroom often produced hot water, almost burned, and the poor toilet paper was poor.It ’s the past. The waiter of the main station did not wear uniforms, the service was very average, and it was far worse than the listing Samsung. The house prices of 280 were not worth it. The only thing that I was pleased was that the door security command was active, very enthusiastic, in place in placeI won't live here when I come back."
0,我订了二个房间。酒店隔音太差，夜间此起彼伏的开门关门声、其它房间的门铃、电话声、走廊中的交谈声。。。声声入耳！这些声音刚停歇，凌晨马路上的拖拉机、大型车辆又开始行动。整晚只睡着三四个小时！携程订房，酒店开始预留的是朝内院的窗外有大型空调机组的房间，看了前面网友评论，怕卡拉OK吵，才换到了朝马路的房间，结果还是这样，强烈建议朋友们不要再订这个酒店。同时地毯脏得出奇，上面有各种液体留下的印记（包括呕吐物）。房间还算大，床也不小，这是它的优点。另外从酒店向东二百米处，位于钱王街与蟠龙路口有一家叫豪顶的饭店味道不错，价格也不贵，我们五个人点了十个菜、二瓶啤酒一大瓶雪碧才三百多元，还吃到了几种野菜、土鸡等。临安大酒店看样子不错，下次可试试。,"I booked two rooms.The sound insulation of the hotel was too bad.EssenceEssenceSound!These sounds just stopped, and the tractors and large vehicles on the road in the early morning began to move.Only three or four hours fall asleep all night!Ctrip booking, the hotel began to reserve rooms in the window of the inner courtyard, there is a large air -conditioning units outside the inner courtyard. After reading the comments of netizens in front, I was afraid of karaoke noisy, so I changed to the room of Chao Road.Book this hotel.At the same time, the carpet was dirty, and there were various liquid marks (including vomit) left by various liquids.The room is quite large and the bed is not small. This is its advantage.In addition, it is two hundred meters east to the east.

0,地毯很赃床下的簧凸出睡得很不舒服隔音很差很吵市有段距不是很方便我得糟糕透了补充点评2007年7月2日：酒店的外很美很棒但去房以後大失所望什外差多本打算住二天後住一天就退房了,"The spring of the carpet is very uncomfortable to sleep well under the bed. The sound insulation is very poor. The market is not very convenient.

0,6月初入住的，据说后楼比前楼条件好，就住了后楼，180一晚。房间非常的小，后楼正在刷外墙，脚手架到处都是。在前台叫了押金，楼层服务员却要把押金条拿走。我和前台理论，前台态度非常强硬，说这是他们的规矩，十几年来都是这样的，还说让我慢慢适应。我不同意，前台让我找楼层服务员自己处理。楼层服务员倒是把押金条退还给我了，但是气呼呼的，要我们自己注意。也不知道注意什么。晚上打开窗，对面前楼的空调机房非常吵。还有脚手架，任何蟊贼都可以直接爬进我们的房间。几乎没有什么客房服务，洗手间里能坏的都是坏的。,"In early June, it is said that the backdoners are better than the front building, and they live in the back floor, 180 a night.The room is very small. The back building is brushing the outer wall and scaffolding everywhere.The deposit was called on the front desk, but the floor waiter had to take away the deposit note.The front desk theory, the front desk attitude is very tough, saying that this is their rules. It has been like this for more than ten years, and I also said that I would slowly adapt.I disagree, I asked me to find the waiter at the front desk to deal with it myself.The waiter of the floor returned the deposit bar to me, but he was angry, so we need to pay attention to ourselves.I don't know what to pay attention to.Open the window at night, and it is very noisy to the air -conditioning machine room in front of the building.There are also scaffolding, and any thief can climb into our room directly.There are almost no room services, and it is bad in the toilet."
0,这鬼地方真的太烂了，哪像人住的，简直难民营，一帮老头老太在楼道里聊天，空调想是出土文物，一股很重酶味，电视也装了有线的，可就是只能收3个频道，还看不清人像，当晚差点晕过去阿。希望各位同仁别去住，另外我觉得携程对酒店的硬件评估有问题，或者在与酒店狼狈为奸,"This ghost place is really bad. Who lives like a person? It is simply a refugee camp. A group of old men and old ladies chat in the corridor. The air conditioning thinks that the cultural relics are unearthed.I can only collect 3 channels, and I can't see portraits. I almost fainted that night.I hope that colleagues do n’t live. In addition, I think there are problems with the hardware assessment of the hotel, or they are raped with the hotel."
0,"酒店设施陈旧,由于是商务出行,需要使用宽带,换了三个房间宽带插座都没有信号,只能作罢,其中两个房间的电视也有问题,不知让人晚上干什么.早餐质量实在很差.差不多是我住过最差的四星酒店了.","The hotel facilities are outdated. Because it is a business travel, I need to use broadband. There is no signal for the three room broadband sockets. It can only be stopped. There are also problems in the TV in two rooms. I don’t know what to do at night.It's the worst four -star hotel I have ever lived."
0,肯定配不上4星级酒店的称号（携程注明可是4颗星）1.大堂太小气，跟汉庭客栈差不多。2.checkin时间太长，永远只有一个接待，一边登记，一边肆无忌惮的接电话，手忙脚乱，才不理会有多少人在排队。3.客房的电话没有快捷键，用起来太麻烦，还得去找分机号。4.卫生间的淋浴不能调节方向，居然还正对着门。5.上次IT告知不能用VPN，有没有搞错，很多大公司要用VPN收邮件啊，要工作啊！6.本想预订回上海的火车票，被告知只能预定飞机票，不能订火车票，岂有此理！哪有四星级酒店不能预定火车票的，没辙，只有自己打的去趟火车站。,"It is definitely not worthy of the title of 4 -star hotel (Ctrip indicates that it is 4 stars) 1. The lobby is too stingy, similar to the Hanting Inn.2.Checkin is too long. There is always only one reception. While registering, he answered the phone while registering, and he was in a hurry to ignore how many people were queuing.3. There are no shortcut keys in the room. It is too troublesome to use, and you have to find the division number.4. The bathroom shower cannot regulate direction, but it is still facing the door.5. The last time IT notified cannot be used with VPN. Is there any mistake? Many large companies need to use VPN to receive emails, and work!6. I wanted to book a train ticket to Shanghai, and I was told that I could only book a plane ticket, and the train ticket could not be booked.There are no train tickets for four -star hotels."
0,性价比太差，大堂不气派。房间一般，服务一般，以后不会住,"The cost performance is too bad, and the lobby is not angry.The room is average, the service is average, and you will not live in the future"
0,在线预订大床房，携程网介绍过于简单，由于18：00后到达，信用卡担保，结果到达在发现是阁楼房，简直.....哎，只希望携程今后能够担负起推荐酒店的审查责任，否则携程会员就无法.......,"Booking a large bed room online, the introduction of Ctrip.com is too simple. Because it arrives at 18:00, the credit card guarantee is found. As a result, it is found that it is a loft room.Otherwise, Ctrip members cannot ..."
0,第一次给一家酒店1分，是因为它挂着四星的牌子。虽然价格在江阴的同级酒店算便宜的，但它确实是我住过的最差劲的四星级酒店。建议把四星的牌子先摘掉，从二星级的某些方面开始做起，然后向三星级看齐，等到所有三星级标准都符合了，才把四星的牌子重新挂上。空调得弄一弄了，实在太吵了。卫生间的设施，就算不换新的，也得弄得给人感觉不会太旧，居然有些地方还发黄了，就连上海路边的公共厕所都不会比它差。房间？也就二星级的水准，糊弄客人也不是这样糊弄的啊！,"The first time I gave a hotel 1 point because it had a four -star brand.Although the price of the same level in Jiangyin is cheap, it is indeed the worst four -star hotel I have lived.It is recommended to remove the four -star brand first, start from some aspects of the two -star, and then align with the three -star level. When all the three -star standards are met, the four -star brand will be re -hung.The air conditioner was so noisy.In the bathroom facilities, even if you do n’t change the new, you have to make people feel that it will not be too old. There are actually some places that are still yellow. Even the public toilets on the roadside of Shanghai will not be worse than it.Room?In the standard of two -star level, it is not so confused to fool the guests!"
0,定的豪华大床房，发现房间超小，而且隔音很不好，房间上个网，居然老是一掉一掉的，半夜1点多居然还有个人自称是长沙公安局的打进我同事的房间电话来，说出了我同事的姓名，身份证号码什么的，然后问我同事要他家里人的联系方式什么的，典型的骗子~~~不知道这些信息是怎么泄露出去的，太怀疑这家酒店了，所以第2天马上就换到合一国际大酒店去了，那边以前还是携程的协议酒店，现在不是了，不过才230左右，比这边好多了~~下次去，还是直接去合一住的好，交通也好，也繁华~~~,"The fixed luxury bedroom, found that the room was super small, and the sound insulation was very bad. The room was on the Internet, but it was always dropped. At 1 o'clock in the middle of the night, there were people who claimed to be the Changsha Public Security Bureau to enter my colleagues.The room phone came, and I talked about my colleague's name, ID number or something, and then asked my colleagues to ask his family's contact information or something, typical liar ~~~ I don’t know how the information was leaked.I suspect this hotel, so I will be changed to the Unified International Hotel on the second day. It was still Ctrip’s protocol hotel before there, but now it is not 230, it is much better than here ~~ I will go next time, Still go directly to the uniform living, good traffic, and prosperity ~~~"
0,潮州迎宾馆确实装修了，不过里面还是那样，隔音效果差，旁边有人开门洗澡听得一清二楚，半夜尽然有老鼠在空调出风口捣乱，另外，房间送餐服务及其差劲，不按餐牌送餐和划价，建议出去吃,"The Chaozhou Welcome Hotel is really decorated, but it is still the same, the sound insulation effect is poor, and someone next to the door opened the door to hear clearly. In the middle of the night, there were mice to make trouble at the air conditioner out of the air conditioner.Meal delivery and prices, it is recommended to go out to eat"
0,房间装修有点旧了，隔音较差，且没有宽带上网，服务中规中举，没什么特别，感觉往来的客人很复杂，有骚扰电话。,"The decoration of the room is a bit old, the sound insulation is poor, and there is no broadband access to the Internet.

0,白天没有热水，洗手间里竟然还有蚂蚁在爬，很小的淋浴房，没有浴缸，没有电梯。早餐简单的难以想象。电脑还有病毒，隔音很差，窗台上可以爬进爬出，很不安全。反正，不像三星的酒店。,"There is no hot water during the day, and ants are climbing in the bathroom.

0,通过携程定了950元三间标准间的套餐，同朋友们三家九口一起入住。由于孩子都比较小，我又直接去电酒店，要求将标房换成大床房，酒店说大床房有斜坡屋顶，可以看星星。5月2日入住酒店，总台告知“酒店没有电梯”，由于房间在三楼大家都认为可以承受，于是提着行李抗着童车背着孩子，跟着服务员去房间。走着走着才发现，原来酒店是连着的好多栋楼，我们的房间同总台隔开2栋，我们跟着服务生上了一层一拐弯，又上一层又一拐，最后还下了一个坡才到达了那个可以看星星的房间。房间大约10个平方米，一半的空间是斜顶屋檐，阳光透过两个小小的老虎窗直射进来，使这个没有凳子的房间倒也显得不是太小。由于节日期间客人刚刚退房，服务员马上给我们重新铺床。随着床单的抖动我发觉空气中飘散着无数的粉尘。然而这还只是噩梦的开始，吃了晚饭我竟然发觉自己在餐厅和客房之间迷路了，我不断的在那几栋房子之间穿越走廊、上下楼梯，大约花了15分钟之后才终于带着满身臭汗回到房间。想洗澡但发觉水管里冒出的全是锈水，问了总台迟迟没有反映，过了20分钟，我的第三个电话总算得到了这样的答案“工程部反映，锅炉没有问题，请多放水应该会好。”在继续放水15分钟锈水依旧之后，我终于在第四个电话里爆发了，随着我的骂声出现了2个工程人员以及一个服务生。他们在卫生间里干了些什么我已经无力关心，因为从发现问题到最终解决用去了将近2个小时。洗完澡我就睡着了，半夜几次被热醒，原来为了节省费用，酒店的中央空调在晚上是关掉的。我一定要告诉所有的人千万不要住这个酒店。顺便说一下，酒店所谓钓鱼的地方就是一个小水塘，里面的水已经有些幅营养化，我在旁边呆了一个下午，也没有见人钓到什么鱼；烧烤的地方苍蝇很多，还有一种小飞虫专门盯着人的眼睛钻，很另人恶心。,"Through Ctrip's set meal for 950 yuan, he stayed with the three of his friends.Because the children are relatively small, I go to the hotel directly and ask for a big bed room. The hotel said that the big bed room has a slope roof to watch the stars.Check in the hotel on May 2nd, and the main station informed that ""the hotel has no elevator"". Because the room was on the third floor, everyone thought it could be afforded, so she carried her luggage to resist the children's car and went to the room with the waiter.After walking and walking, I found that the hotel was a lot of buildings. Our room was separated by two buildings in the same platform. We followed the waiter to turn a layer by layer, and then the upper floor.It took a slope to reach the room that could watch the stars.The room is about 10 square meters. Half of the space is oblique roof. The sun shines directly through two small tiger windows, making this room without stools not too small.As the guests just checked out during the festival, the waiter immediately paved us in bed.With the shake of the sheets, I found that countless dust was scattered in the air.However, this is just the beginning of a nightmare. After dinner, I realized that I was lost between the restaurant and the guest room.Back full of stinky sweat back to the room.I wanted to take a bath, but I found that the rust water emerged from the water pipe was not reflected. After 20 minutes, my third phone finally got such an answer.It should be better to put more water. ""After continuing to release the water for 15 minutes, I finally broke out on the fourth phone. With my scolding, two engineers and one waiter appeared.What they did in the bathroom, I was unable to care about it, because from the discovery of the problem to the final solution for nearly 2 hours.I fell asleep after taking a shower. I was awakened several times in the middle of the night. It turned out that the central air conditioner of the hotel was turned off at night in order to save costs.I must tell everyone not to stay in this hotel.By the way, the so -called fishing place in the hotel is a small pond. The water inside is already somewhat nutritious. I stayed next to the afternoon without seeing any fish. There were many flies in the barbecue.The small flying worm stared at people's eyes and drilled, which was very disgusting."
0,一个充满铜臭的酒店。吸氧，每小时要收90元。办理入住，直接扣除2天房费，并声称若不足2天，不退款。热水龙头出水奇慢。相关问题，前台一问三不知。,"A hotel full of copper.Oxygen absorbing 90 yuan per hour.Check in, deduct two days of room fee directly, and claim that if there are less than 2 days, there will be no refund.The hot water faucet is strange.Related issues, I do n’t know about the front desk."

The room facilities were relatively new. But the days when I stayed in, from entering to leaving, the hotel does not supply hot water. Think about more than a thousand house prices and lose.Dalian is in repairing the pipeline, it is a shame. I have confirmed that the hotel of many friends in the same period has not received the impact. The interpretation of the hotel is very reluctant. When I booked, I use a credit card to guarantee it. They do not cancel me to check in or not, nor doesFor discounts, say that it is not resistant to time (Our flight forced to land in Shenyang due to weather, and the hotel does not cancel us to redeem the scheduled, causing us to take a taxi to come to Dalian overnight !!) This is also very angry. Even such a big thing isDon't tell me. In short, staying in such a shameless unlucky.

0,本人在江苏入住最差的一个宾馆。晚上准备洗澡居然有一群男人拿着房卡直接开门进来，说这个房间是他的，行李还在里面。我是下午入住的，房间里面没有任何东西。叫来服务员，原来人家没有退房就把人家的行李扔出去了。所以，别人的钥匙还能开我的门。恐怖！这样的管理水平谁还敢住？洗澡水不热，第二天就感冒了。早饭更是没说的，一塌糊涂，没几个菜，都是凉的。服务员态度狂差，都欠她的。这种宾馆建议携程拉入黑名单，不要出来害人了。,"I stayed in the worst hotel in Jiangsu.In the evening, a group of men were going to take a bath in a group of men. They opened the door and opened the door directly. They said that the room was his, and the luggage was still inside.I stayed in the afternoon, and there was nothing in the room.Call the waiter. It turned out that they threw out their luggage without checking out.Therefore, the keys of others can still open my door.fear!Who dares to stay in such a management level?Bathing water was not hot, and he caught a cold the next day.Breakfast was not even said. There was a mess. Without a few dishes, it was cold.The waiter was bad and owed her.This kind of hotel recommends that Ctrip in the blacklist, don't come out to harm people."
0,本来打算在这里入住2天的，但是由于网络极差，导致本人的网络会议数度中断，严重影响工作，所以匆忙离开。对客房的映像很模糊了，唯有哪位业余的IT令我映像深刻！大堂的装修还算可以，服务员也比较热情。对于那些要求高品质网络的用户，不提倡入住。,"It was originally intended to stay here for 2 days, but because the network was extremely poor, my network meeting was interrupted several times and seriously affected the work, so I hurriedly left.The image of the guest room is very vague, and only any amateur IT makes me a deep image!The decoration of the lobby is okay, and the waiter is more enthusiastic.For users who require high -quality networks, they do not advocate check -in."

0,"浴巾是洁白新的,毛巾脏到灰黑色.被子不错,但几乎没褥子,喜欢硬板床的TZ有福了,绝对够硬.交通是秦皇岛和北戴河之间的大马路旁,评价是:路边店.不知是否抱怨携成佣金多,给的也是位置最差的2间(一层餐厅门口),实际酒店当天入住率不高,何必呢.7.8号早7:30开始钻头声大作,直到10点多我们离开.我选酒店靠评论还很少失手,这次是挂2个大眼袋浑身痛(咯的)回去的.如果各位和我一样把住宿和度假心情结合的话,最好别选.我不求硬件多好,只要干净温暖,多花点钱都愿意.以后仅记,一定要住旅游局正式挂牌的酒店!!各方面都不正规,别看照片,和实际差远了.","The bath towel is white and new, the towel is so gray -black. The quilt is good, but there is almost no mattress. The TZ who likes a hard board bed is blessed. It is definitely hard enough. The traffic is the roadside between Qinhuangdao and Beidaihe.I don't know if I complain about carrying more commissions, and give the two worst positions (at the entrance of one -floor restaurant). The actual hotel in actual hotels is not high on the same day.We leave more. I have rarely lost their hands when I choose a hotel. This time, two large bags under the eyes are painful (giggled). If you combine your accommodation and vacation mood like me, it is best not to choose.It ’s good to do n’t ask for hardware. As long as you are clean and warm, you will be willing to spend more money. In the future, you only need to stay in the hotel that is officially listed in the Tourism Bureau !! It’ s not formal in all aspects. Do n’t look at the photos, far from the actual difference."
0,1、房间太小，小的有点过份。所谓的可供上网的台子小的快连笔记本电脑都放不下了。我在搞电脑时，差点摔破酒店的杯子。2、此期间通过携程预订，酒店赠送精美钥匙扣。钥匙扣在哪里？好像没送。3、早餐时间8时40分要求在餐厅煎蛋的服务生，煎个鸡蛋，回答说今天煎蛋结束，我说为何？服务生告之没蛋了，我说还有二十分钟早餐才结束，为何就没蛋了，仅仅是个鸡蛋。当时想找他们经理，算了吧，还是写在这里。4、失望。下次不去再去。,"1. The room is too small, and the small ones are a bit too much.The so -called tabletables that can be available on the Internet can't let go of the laptop.When I was engaged in the computer, I almost broke the hotel's cup.2. During this period, the hotel presented exquisite keychain through Ctrip.Where is the keychain?It doesn't seem to be sent.3. Breakfast time is 8:40, the waiter who is fried in the restaurant, fried eggs, and answer that the fried egg is over today. Why do I say?The waiter told that there was no egg. I said that there were still 20 minutes of breakfast to end. Why was there no egg? It was just an egg.At that time, I wanted to find their managers, forget it, I still write here.4, disappointment.Don't go again next time."
0,泰和楼房间还不错。单入住和退房手续时间太长。入住时先告诉我房间未整理好，但不能先办入住和放行李入房间（因急着有其他事情）。后来房间OK后还是用了40分钟才办好入住手续。,"Taihe Building Room is not bad.Single -up and check -up procedures are too long.When I stayed, I told me that the room was not sorted out, but I couldn't get a check -in and put my luggage into the room (due to other things because of anxiety).Later, it took 40 minutes to check in after the room was OK."
0,此酒店门面很小，完全不像一个三星级酒店。入住率好像也不高，反正我住的时候，人很少。房间大小比较标准，但是光线不是很好。网络奇差无比，经常连不上。服务很一般,"The facade of this hotel is very small, not like a three -star hotel at all.The rate of staying does not seem to be high. Anyway, when I live, there are very few people.The size of the room is relatively standard, but the light is not very good.The network is extremely poor and often cannot connect.The service is average"
0,1房间很小，地毯很脏，白毛巾显黑色2中央空调有异响，后半夜只好关掉3洗澡水忽冷忽热,"The room is very small, the carpet is dirty, the white towel shows the black 2 central air conditioner, and it has to be turned off 3 in the middle of the night."
0,硬件差：房间设施简单、陈旧，房内有较重的异味，半夜后中央空调“罢工”。服务差：进房发现，床单和被褥就简单地铺在床上，根本没有拉平整。走廊、过道、楼后场地到处是桌椅、杂物乱堆乱放的场景（看得出酒店管理、服务的基本水准）。餐饮差：办理入住手续时，总台推荐在酒店用餐（加之17087105的好评），“果断”决定不另找饭店。在点菜时就感觉不对，点菜员对鱼缸里寥寥三、四种鱼类大多不认识，对菜单上菜的烧法更是一百个“抱歉”。上桌的菜就更糟了（58元一个鱼头沙锅就是半锅汤和一堆鱼头散骨头......）。早餐要另买票不算，质量实在不敢恭维。（17087105：我的好朋友，你的点评对我们入住该地真的很关键，你可把我们“小害”了一次！）卫生差：这是最要命的一点，在离开酒店后的路上，车上的两位女士（妹妹和夫人）均出现了不雅观的动作，一个拼命抓挠手臂，一个拼命抓挠脚背，仔细一看，原来两位白嫩的皮肤上长出了一个个小红点，一开始还以为是蚊子咬的，但马上被稍有医学知识的妹夫否定了，蚊子咬的不会这么小（是啥生物咬的不言自明）。青山湖真的不是几年前的青山湖了，原来的美景被尘土飞扬、泥浆满地的房产开发工地所取代。看到几年曾经入住，且颇为满意的天乞宾馆，如今大门紧闭，人去楼空，窗门破碎，锈迹斑斑，萧条之景，让人寒心。再回头看看400多块的享受这样的度假酒店，也就不奇怪了。我每次入住一个酒店，都喜欢以褒为主，点评一下。但唯一这次，恕我直言，且毫不偏激地说一句，这样的酒店，有辱携程！补充点评2007年5月9日：过去5、6天了，妻子脚上的小红点还未消掉，前几天还奇痒无比，可见那些小红点很毒的，住这个酒店后悔死了！,"Poor hardware: The room facilities are simple and old, and there are heavy odors in the room. After the middle of the night, the central air -conditioning ""strike"".Poor service: When you enter the room, you find that the sheets and bedding are simply spread on the bed, and it is not flattened at all.The corridor, aisle, and the background venues are full of tables and chairs and debris (the basic level of hotel management and service).Dining poor: When checking in the procedures, the main station recommends dining at the hotel (plus praise from 17087105), and ""decisive"" decides not to find another restaurant.I feel wrong when ordering. Most of the three or four types of fish in the fish tank do not know each other. The method of burning the menu is a hundred ""sorry"".The dish on the table is even worse (a fish head casserole of 58 yuan is a half pot of soup and a pile of fish heads ...).It is not considered to buy another ticket for breakfast, and the quality is really dare not compliment.(17087105: My good friend, your comments are really critical to us to stay in the place, you can ""small harm"" once!) Hygienic poor: This is the most terrible point, on the way to leave the hotel,The two ladies (sisters and wives) in the car have indecent movements. One desperately scratching her arms, one desperately scratching her feet.At first, I thought it was bite by mosquitoes, but was immediately denied by my brother -in -law with a little medical knowledge. The mosquito would not bite so small (what kind of creature was bitten).Qingshan Lake is really not the Aoyama Lake a few years ago. The original beauty was replaced by the real estate development site of the dust and mud full of mud.Seeing the Tianqi Hotel, who had been staying in and quite satisfied, now the door is closed, people go to the building, the windows and doors are broken, the rust is spots, and the depression is chilling.Looking back at more than 400 yuan to enjoy such a holiday hotel, it is not surprising.Every time I stay in a hotel, I like to focus on praise.But this time, forgive me, and said without extreme words, such a hotel has a humiliation of Ctrip!Supplementary comment on May 9, 2007: In the past 5 or 6 days, the small red dots on the wife's feet have not yet disappeared. A few days ago, it was extremely itchy. It can be seen that those little red dots are very poisonous.It's!"

0,房间装修比较旧，周边也没有休闲购物的地方，性价比不高。虽然说免费提供上网，但实际上网上不了，最后还要住电脑房才能上网，不适合商务出差。还要投诉一点，浴室的用具，包括沐浴露和洗发水，有些是满的，有些只有半瓶，有可能是上回用剩的，请各位入住时注意。,"The room decoration is relatively old, and there are no places where they are shopping in the surroundings, and the cost performance is not high.Although it is said that it provides free Internet access, but in fact, it can't be online. In the end, it is necessary to live in a computer house to access the Internet. It is not suitable for business trips.Also complaints, the utensils of the bathroom, including bathdrops and shampoo, are full, and some are only half bottles. It may be left in the last time. Please pay attention when you check in."
0,"酒店老化,房间装修差,服务过于生硬,中午退房时间过不到两小时收取半日房费，而其它酒店基本从人性化考虑，不收此项费用．","The hotel is aging, the room decoration is poor, and the service is too rigid. The check -up time is charged half a day's room fee in less than two hours. Other hotels are basically humanized and do not charge this fee."
0,什么电力宾馆呀？！根本就象私人的“大车店”！服务不是一般的不规范（收款除外）。入住该宾馆的时候，打开房门一看：纸篓是满满的，洗手盆里都是污水，马桶里也是污水（马桶还是“长流水”），毛巾和地板都是灰色的。打扫过的房间，洗手盆里还满是黑乎乎的油污。第二天早晨，我们刚刚起床，服务员连门都没有敲直接推门就进去了，说是要打扫房间。当我们离开房间的时候，我告诉总台打扫，可是4个小时以后我们回来，房间里就和走的时候一样。房间里电视和宽带也没有了。再次去找总台，等了半个小时都没有人来……总之，就是有一种被愚弄了的感觉。建议携程网取消该宾馆的合同，否则也许会影响到自己的信誉。,"What kind of electric hotel?IntersectionIt's like a private ""big car shop"" at all!Services are not general irregular (except for receipt).When staying at the hotel, opened the door and saw it: The paper basket was full, the washbasin was full of sewage, and the toilet was also sewage (toilet or ""long flowing water""). The towels and floors were gray.The cleaning room was full of dark oil.The next morning, we just got up, and the waiter went in without even knocking on the door, saying that he wanted to clean the room.When we left the room, I told the main station to clean, but we came back 4 hours later, and the room was the same as when it was walking.The TV and broadband in the room are gone.Go to the main station again, and no one will come for half an hour ... In short, there is a feeling of being foolish.It is recommended that Ctrip to cancel the hotel's contract, otherwise it may affect your reputation."
0,盐城来了很多次，第一次住盐阜宾馆，我的确很失望整个墙壁黑咕隆咚的，好像被烟熏过一样家具非常的破旧早餐品种少的可怜，水果只有西瓜，房间的电视是90年代的价格和房间严重不成比例的宾馆还说是江曾经住过的最后才知道他当年住的是总统套房我晕如果你有好奇心倒是可以去住啊呵呵,"Yancheng has been here many times. For the first time I stayed at Yanfu Hotel, I was really disappointed with the entire wall.The hotel with a serious price and a serious proportion of the room also said that Jiang had lived in the end that he knew that he lived in the presidential suit."
0,我们去盐城的时候那里的最低气温只有4度，晚上冷得要死，居然还不开空调，投诉到酒店客房部，得到的答复是现在还没有领导指示需要开暖气，如果冷到话可以多给一床被子，太可怜了。。。,"When we went to Yancheng to Yancheng, the lowest temperature there was only 4 degrees. It was too cold at night to die. Instead, he did not open the air conditioner. He complained to the hotel room department.A bed quilt is so pitiful.EssenceEssence"
